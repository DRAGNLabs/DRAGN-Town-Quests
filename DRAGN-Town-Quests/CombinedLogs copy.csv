1|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 0 sounded most like an interesting quest. None really answered the question, but Option 0 sounded the closest to the answer.
2|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 2 sounded like it would be the most promising in answering my question. 
3|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 2 seemed the most promising to answer the question.
4|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: Option 0 because it sounded the most interesting. Option 2 made the most sense because it talked about getting meat (aka hunting).
5|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: Option 1 is very funny, it has nothing to do with my prompt,, but adds flavor to the quest. Option 2 was most responsive because it fits with the statement that I made.

1|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 1 was hard to understand. Didn't seem like complete idea. Option 0 was good because it was clear and seemed like a response to what I said.
2|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 1 doesn't make sense. Option 0 at least mentioned gold or treasure of some sort which I associated with a rainbow.
3|Sat:ngram|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 0 talked about building something. And the steps to it were very clear. Option 1 just didn't make sense.
4|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 1 at least talked about the land being contaminated, I would assume that hay or grass would need to be used to feed the sheep. Therefore the land would need to be healed.
5|Sat:ngram|Res:ngram|User responded: Titan Device and Elixer seemed most related to the moon.
Jon|||
1|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 0 was hard to understand, didn't understand the quest. Option 2, who doesn't like killing stuff?
2|Sat:ngram|Res:wow|User responded: Option 2 was satisfying because it was interesting what i'd have to do. Option 1 was responsive because it sounded closest to what I asked. It was in line with what I was looking for.
3|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 2 was the most personal despite the funny quest because the dialogue made it feel more personal. It wasn't just a task, but it was an adventure to avenge the person. There is more purpose.
4|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 was good because it gave a purpose to take my mind off of my suicidal ideation. Option 0 because this had more to do with what my problem was.
5|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 0 because it seemed to apply to hunting dragons which is what I was seeking. For this reason, it seemed that it was responsive as well.

1|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 2 had the best dialogue. It was the most interesting. Option 0 wasn't very descriptive but matched the best.
2|Sat:ngram|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 2 made me more curious. As for responsive, Option 2 seemed to address my statement the best.
3|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 2 for both, because it was super responsive. It was an intruiging quest where it seemed that the player was destined for something greater than they thought.
4|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 0 seemed the most like a mission and related to the statement. Wasn't applicable but could be twisted to fit.
5|Sat:ngram|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 for both because it seemed dangerous, but managable. It was also responsive because it implied that I had left somehwere else. Close enough.
Cory|||
1|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: I could see 2 being in a game, but 0 was more interesting and had more components. 1 was off. 
2|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: The wording on 0 was kind of strange, but all 3 had good dialogue and titles. 
3|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: 0 was basically exactly what the prompt was, a little bland, but was better compared to the others. 
Conrad|||
1|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 2 sounded the most like a quest I would see in a game. Option 0 seems to be closer to what I was looking for, but none directly helped me answer my question.
2|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 2 was very detailed, but it didn't directly answer my question. Option 1 made the most sense with my question. 
3|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 1 and 0 were hard to figure out. None were very responsive, but 2 was the best.
4|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 2 made the most sense with what I asked, it didn't directly answer the question, but could be step 1 to a larger quest.
5|Sat:us|Res:us|User responded: Option 0 was kind of funny, creative, and an off the wall quest. It doesn't directly answer the question, but bizzarre enough it could answer the question.
Cairo|||
1|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 seemed responsive because it described the best adventure. Option 0 was the most exciting.
2|Sat:us|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 was the most responsive, because it got that I wanted to make something. Option 1 was also the most satisfying because it is the most compelling.
3|Sat:us|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 0 because this felt like an actual quest within a game that i'd want to do. Option 1 was the most responsive because it understood that I was searching for something.
4|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 captivated me, caused me to think I was the only guy this guy could help. Option 0 was the most responsive because the word's "you're in luck player" was a good solid response to what I said. 
5|Sat:wow|Res:ngram|User responded: Option 1 was the most satisfying because it was funny. Option 2 because the "questionable task" can relate to "kill my father".
Addison|||
1|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: Option 1 had a lot of detail and had me imagining it in my mind. Option 2 said it would let me in on the secret (my question) once I completed something
2|Sat:wow|Res:us|User responded: Option 2 had a lot of detail and was fun to read. Option 0 directly answered my desire of wanting to fight the dragon. 
3|Sat:wow|Res:wow|User responded: Option 1 was detailed and interesting. It also seemed to point me in the best direction of my question. 
4|Sat:ngram|Res:ngram|User responded: This one was a bit humorous and sounded like a real mission. It at least pointed me in the right direction to my question 
5|Sat:us|Res:wow|User responded: Option 1 gives great detail and uses vocabulary that sounds like a real video game quest. Option 0 talks about a companion, a person that could help me like my question asked
