Travel to the Chamber of Heart and commune with Azeroth.	The Heart of Azeroth	Our world's dyin', George. Sargeras's sword has cut deep. Her pain is drivin' the elements into a frenzy! I can hear Azeroth's voice, but she needs more than her speaker. She needs her champion. Far below us lies an ancient titan vault called the Chamber of Heart. I sense she wishes tae speak tae ye there. Come with me into the chamber. It may be our only chance tae save her! 
Recover the Branch of Nordrassil from the Firelands.	Delegation	I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, Human, which means my mission here now must fall to you. A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development. A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame. You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the World Tree's branch. 
Meet Magni Bronzebeard in Silithus, located within Kalimdor.	A Dying World	Champion. Magni Bronzebeard needs your help. Azeroth is dying. Before this war, a massive demon called Sargeras stabbed the planet with a sword. Our planet cries out in pain while the Horde and Alliance fight amongst each other. Magni Bronzebeard believes you can help heal the planet's wounds. Meet him in Silithus. He has set up camp where Sargeras's sword impacted our world. 
Accumulate 20 Winterspring Cub Whiskers shed by your Winterspring Cub. Bring the whiskers, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to Rivern Frostwind.	They Grow Up So Fast	I think this little fellow will be a good match for you. This cub is going to require a lot of attention to ensure that he grows up strong and healthy. You should check up on your cub at least once each day. Feeding and caring for your Winterspring cub is the best way to build a bond of trust with him. As your cub grows, he will shed his old whiskers and grow new ones appropriate to his size. Once your cub has shed twenty whiskers, bring him back to me along with some materials for your saddle. 
Loot 3 Black Empire Caches in Uldum.	Lessons in Brigandry	The Wastewanders have spent many generations as brigands, whether on land or sea. Though we have decided to hang up that life for a chance at a more peaceful existence, we have not forgotten the lessons we've learned in those days. One such lesson I feel is particularly relevant now -- when faced with a superior opponent, it often helps to use their weapons against them. Find their hidden caches and take whatever you can carry. You may just find something that can turn the tide of this battle. 
Mor'vek in Un'goro Crater claims that if you were poisoned by Venomhide Ravasaur blood 20 times, you could ride one without dying. Attack Venomhide Ravasaurs for a chance to be poisoned.	Toxic Tolerance	You want to ride a Venomhide? Then I've got bad news for you. The Venomhide Ravasaurs, they're all poison: Poison blood, poison spit, poison skin. You climb on one, you fall off dead in a few hours. You'd have to build up a resistance to their toxins before I sold you one, and that takes a long, LONG time... you'd need to be splashed with poisonous blood while fighting one numerous times. If you're really interested, the venomhides prefer the northern area of the Marshlands, northwest of here. 
Check in with Recruiter Lee at Stormwind Harbor.	Legion: The Legion Returns	Heroes of the Alliance, I write to you in Azeroth's darkest hour. From the maw of hell, the burning armies of the Legion have returned. Our fleets depart for the Broken Isles at once. As a grand lance, we will pierce the Legion's lines and drive them back to the nether that spawned them. Your ship awaits in the Stormwind Harbor, make haste. 
Complete 4 Azerite world quests.	Champions of Azeroth	Assist Magni by completing 4 Azerite world quests. 
Attend the war meeting in Grommash Hold.	Battle for Azeroth: Mission Statement	The warchief has requested to meet with you in person. Lady Sylvanas was impressed with the prowess and courage you displayed during our mission to Exile's Reach. Now that you've arrived, I will make the introduction. 
Breathe in the incense in front of Keeper Karithus, and then choose the blessing of the Great Stag Spirit, the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, or the Great Moonstalker Spirit. Keep in mind that you can only receive the blessing of one spirit, so choose wisely.	The Ritual Bond	I will tend to Grimclaw until his rest is done - he will be ready to return very soon. I have one more task for you while we wait... a favor to grant you, really, should you recognize it. The great wildlife spirits roam around us waiting and hoping for someone that will aid in stopping the destruction. They are with us as we speak even now, and with the materials you brought me, I can grant you sight. Speak to these spirits, choose one, and return to me with their blessing. 
Speak to General Nazgrim in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	The Art of War	Lok'tar Ogar, old friend. It has been too long since last we spoke. It is good to see that you emerged safely from the depths of Vashj'ir. I am stationed here in Grommash Hold. All in service to the Horde are to swear allegiance to their new Warchief. You would do well not to keep him waiting, George. 
Talk to Foreman Glibbs just inside the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Orgrimmar.	Machines of War	Far to the east the ""Worldbreakers"" lay hidden in the Twilight Highlands. We must end their threat and we will do it with the most powerful army ever! Our new allies, the goblins, are making us new machines of war but I hear that there are problems with the quality. We can't fight with broken war machines. Speak to Foreman Glibbs and make sure our machines are ready for battle. 
Speak to Commander Schnottz.	Firing Squad	Come out back vizh me, Human. Zhere is somezhink I vould like you to see. 
Meet Master Mathias Shaw in Stormwind Harbor.	Battle for Azeroth: Hour of Reckoning	Champions of the Alliance, At last the time has come for us to reclaim what is rightfully ours! Our final push to retake Lordaeron Keep shall commence at dawn. The Horde and their Warchief must answer for their crimes! 
Find and close 3 Void Tears in Uldum.	Close to Tears	Our warriors have observed foul manifestations coming forth from numerous void tears within the surrounding jungle. They have been but mere weaklings, clearly intended to test our defenses before the real forces arrive. If we do not deal with this threat now, however, it will only be a matter of time until we are overrun by their fodder. Find a way to close those portals! 
Collect 8 Coalesced Corruption from slimes in Uldum.	Questionable Sourcing	My clairvoyance provides a great strategic asset to the people of Ramkahen. However, the potency of my visions of late has proven taxing to my health. I have devised a tonic that may serve to dull the harm these visions cause, but it will require the coalesced essence of the Old Gods' corruption. If you could retrieve some samples of this for me, it could prove invaluable in our efforts. 
Kill 5 Amethyst Scarabs, 5 Sapphire Scarabs, 5 Turquoise Scarabs, and 5 Emerald Scarabs.	Just a Fancy Cockroach	Evidently, the ancient statues were home to various species of scarab. Determined to leave this site in the best condition possible, you resolve to ridding the chamber of these pests. 
Speak to Ziradormi in Orgrimmar.	Your Time Has Come	<A pleasant image fills your mind's eye as a calm voice echoes through your being.>Young Mechanic, be still and hear my words. I am called to collect you, to deliver you, to one whose eye none can escape. Find me in Orgrimmar, mortal, for your time has come. 
Complete the Battle for Lordaeron.	The Battle for Lordaeron	King Wrynn has mustered our forces, George. We mean to launch a full-scale assault on Lordaeron. We'll drive the Horde from the keep and reclaim it for the Alliance. It's been far too long since our flag flew in Tirisfal. Ready to ship out? Captain Angelica here will see to your transport. 
Use the Captured Totem to set it on the ground, and kill 10 Mottled Drywallow Crocolisks or Drywallow Daggermaws near it to test its effects.	The Grimtotem Weapon	During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us. It seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it. The watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem. 
Overseer Gorthak wants you to bring him the Kaldorei Assassin's Head.	Security!	It's not as like I haven't got enough to think about here! Keeping this place operational is hard enough without constant elf and draenei harassment. Now, on top of everything, there's an assassin lurking around the camp who's killed an important diplomat... on my watch! Whoever it is couldn't have gotten far, Mechanic. Scour the camp until you find her and then avenge the diplomat! At least I can bring the assassin's head with me when I have to answer to Hellscream. 
Complete ""The Stormwind Extraction"" scenario.	The Stormwind Extraction	My lady is shrewd indeed. If we are to infiltrate Stormwind City, we will need the very best the Horde has to offer, and yet a team so small as to be able to infiltrate the heart of Alliance territory unseen.<Nathanos peers at the gathered group, stroking his chin.>Yes, I see. The path ahead is clear. Speak to me when you are ready to undertake the Warchief's mission, George. 
Speak with Provisioner Qorra in Uldum for your reward.	Supplies from the Uldum Accord	The Uldum Accord appreciates all the help you've given us. Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us. 
Collect 9 pieces of Infernal Debris from Shatter Scar Vale.	Fel To Pieces	The infernals that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers. Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death. The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful. 
Deliver the Free Ticket Voucher to Gelvas Grimegate, located inside the Darkmoon Faire.	The Darkmoon Faire	The Darkmoon Faire is coming! Experience our thrilling games, win fabulous prizes, have your fortune told! If you act right now, you can redeem this voucher for free prize tickets and a copy of the world-famous Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide to help you identify treasures in your travels! Just hand your voucher to Gelvas Grimegate located inside the Faire. Right now, the entrance to the Faire is outside Goldshire, in Elwynn Forest. 
Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple has requested that you recover Dahlia's Tears from soil freshly cleansed by a Ruby Keeper's flames.	Dahlia's Tears	In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light. We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad... a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague. Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me. 
Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 4 Bloodcursed Souls.	The Hopeless Ones...	On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse. It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me. Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task. 
Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time.	A Legendary Engagement	I expected that I would find you here, Mechanic. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.<Coridormi smiles.>For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you. I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, George. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once. Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you. 
Collect an Iron Box and a Russet Belt from locations within Stormwind, and a Standard Scope from an engineer.	Light Camera Action	Oh, hi! Isn't this a great shot? I love my S.E.L.F.I.E. camera! Do you want me to make you one, too? I only need a few parts! For the strap, I'll need a Russet Belt from one of the armor merchants in Stormwind. I've already ordered more housings, you're welcome to take one, you just have to find where my shipment ended up! Oh, and a Standard Scope, most any engineer can make you one of those. Ok, are you ready for a little photography action?! 
Find and kill the surveyor Henry Zykes.	Stalling the Survey	These maps have all been drawn by the same steady hand. I've seen a human surveyor heading up and down the road between the hold and the jungle to the east. We can set their plans back by making an example out of this surveyor, George.<Kilrok points to the signature at the bottom of the maps.>What do you think that says? ""Zykes?"" Even human names sound thin and weak. Kill him. 
Speak to a Darkspear Jailor, then enter the proving pit and kill a Captive Spitescale Scout.	Proving Pit	Ya done quite well for ya'self, Mechanic. I'm sure I could teach ya a trick or two here and dere, but I not be wastin' ya time on tiki targets no longer. l put one last trial before ya den, mon. Head over to da provin' pit in the middle of dis area and fight a real baddy - one dat wants ta kill ya back. Just let the jailor by the pit know when ya ready. 
Kill 8 Amathet Bowmen in Uldum.	Down From the Sky	The archers of Ramkahen are highly skilled, but the bows of the Amathet have the advantage of range. This makes our incursions into their territory highly dangerous. You have a knack for fighting behind enemy lines. If you could thin out their ranks, it could provide us an opportunity to push their lines back for once. Will you help? 
Speak with Chromie in Stormwind.	Adventurers Wanted: Chromie's Call	Chromie is seeking veteran adventurers to embark on expeditions through time and space. This is your opportunity to experience the legendary adventures of the past--today! Speak with Chromie near the Stormwind Embassy for more information. 
Speak to Sorata Firespinner in Bilgewater Harbor.	Farewell, Minnow	Thank you, little one. Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of. You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there. Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything. 
Use Delaris's Prism to terrify 20 Jadefire Imps.	Open Their Eyes	Before you go...I've taken advantage of my ""alone time"" with Impsy here to learn some interesting facts about imps. Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of. I thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring. This prism will project an image of... well, of what Impsy described. Shadowlurk Ridge is still swarming with imps. Why don't you go test their reaction for me? 
Activate the four nearby elemental crucibles in the correct order to take control of the Eye of Twilight.	Elementary!	<You can't read the text, but diagrams seem to indicate that the devices around you should be activated in a set order.><One passage of the Apocrypha has been translated to modern text:> In the beginning was shadow eternal. Hate blazed forth, and FIRE was born. Wounds scabbed, and so begat EARTH. Cries of anguish birthed howling WIND. Wherein the skies wept seas of TEARS. We live in the shadow, The world we know Built of rage, hurt, anguish and sorrow. 
Use the Raging Vortex Gem at Nijel's Point Ruin. While commanding your firestorm, kill 40 Nijel's Point Defenders and burn 15 Nijel's Point Merchants. Should you lose your Raging Vortex Gem, you may acquire another from the Ancient Vortex Runestone.	Rider on the Storm	You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of Elune. You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy. As it was Furien's tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life. The Alliance scum at Nijel's Point shall pay for their offenses against the Horde! 
Defeat Vorsha the Lasher.	Vorsha the Lasher	Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path. But I am ready, George. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar. The naga honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger. We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies. 
Inspect Hellscream Demolishers until you find a faulty one, then teach its Chief Engineer a lesson.	Weapons of Mass Dysfunction	<Glibbs mops sweat from his brow with a greasy handkerchief.>Saurfang isn't happy with our work? This is very bad. My boys need to step it up. Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the Horde is depending upon them! 
Use Dartol's Rod and speak with Ota Wen. Convince him to rise up against his Horde oppressors. Then, deliver Dartol's Rod to Raene Wolfrunner.	True Power of the Rod	Now, take the rod and while using its power, speak with my brother, Ota Wen. Ota is amongst the other furbolg that the orcs have captured and have penned in the giant cage on the north side of Silverwind Refuge. The rod will allow you to convince Ota and the other furbolg to rise up and attack the Horde. Then you may go wherever your path leads you. Just know that you have found a new friend for that which you have done. 
Speak to Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the Barrow Dens in Hyjal.	A Prisoner of Interest	The Twilight's Hammer wants to free Fandral Staghelm? Malfurion suspected his corruption ran deep... this just cements it. At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid. I've a plan, George. We will move the prisoner through the Emerald Dream. It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success. Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast. 
Speak with Captain Garrick to find out what is happening between the Horde and Alliance.	War with the Horde	Good to see you've received proper training as a Mechanic. We'll need it for what's next. The Alliance's war with the Horde has reached a fevered pitch... and we've lost a lot of good soldiers. King Anduin is looking for aid in an operation to bolster our forces. I told him you'd be a good fit for the job. Before you meet him, let me get get you caught up on what has been happening so far. 
Use the Phaseblood Potion at the Sigil of Tichondrius to shift into the nether, and search for the Claw of Tichondrius.	Touch the Untouchable	I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there. You won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours. And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me! 
Speak to Cenarion Emissary Jademoon to secure transportation to Moonglade.	Hero's Call: Mount Hyjal!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade. Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground! Speak with Cenarion Emissary Jademoon in Stormwind Keep to gain entry into Moonglade. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>! 
Bring the Otherworldly Saddle to H'Partho Adoros in Ramkahen.	My Own Drone	The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted. I know it looks... aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable. I hope it serves you well. 
Naraat the Earthspeaker wants you to look into the Waters of Farseeing.	The Eye of the Storm	Greetings, hero of Azeroth. We of the Earthen Ring know you by name, George. Your exploits and accomplishments are many. Azeroth already stands in your debt, and yet again she is in need of her heroes. I am but a messenger. A powerful presence seeks audience with you. Peer into the Waters of Farseeing and behold the dilemma of our world. 
Speak to General Nazgrim aboard Hellscream's Fist.	All Aboard!	You hear all of that, George? There are Alliance that need killing and I need to round up a veteran crew. You're coming with me! We won't be returning until our assignment's complete, so round up your things and make ready. I'll be aboard a newly commissioned gunship over Bladefist Bay. Don't keep me waiting! 
Moxie Steelgrille wants you to dissolve 10 oozes and report back to her at Beezil's Wreck.	Corrosion Prevention	Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo! I can't go back empty-handed, Mechanic! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything! This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off. 
Stop the Darkscale Priestesses from offering the Horn of the Ancients to Azshara above Nazj'vel.	The Offering to Azshara	The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel. Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed. 
Check in with Friz Groundspin at the Southern Rocketway Terminus in Azshara.	Twilight Skies	I just got word from Orgrimmar that the Warchief wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help! The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us. No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up. 
Blow your horn at Echeyakee's lair to summon him. Slay or subdue him.	Echeyakee	Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain. The tauren say he is both mercy and death. George, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo. Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come. 
Place the Bloodtooth Banner on the Foulweald Totem Mound. Do not let the furbolgs destroy the banner before their chief arrives. Defeat Chief Murgut.	King of the Foulweald	I care little for who you are, Human. What I do care about is the salvation of the furbolg. Take this Bloodtooth tribe banner a short ways northeast into Greenpaw Village and place it upon their totem mound. They will consider this an act of aggression and try to destroy the banner. Hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe, then kill the traitor! Govern your strength wisely, friend, you're in for a long fight. 
Defeat the Baruk Stone Defender in a pet battle with your Shadowbarb Hatchling in your party.	The Littlest Defender	The Baruk mogu are known for animating ancient statues to serve as defenders of their territory. They are a resilient foe, and much can be learned from battling an enemy with such rigid defenses. Fortunately, it seems like one of their Stoneshapers mistakenly animated a small idol. It has been discarded as useless to the mogu who made it, but it could prove a valuable training opportunity for our hatchling. Find this miniature defender in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. 
	Making Amends	 
Place Twinkles' favorite toy by his grave at the Sludge Fields in Hillsbrad Foothills.	Due Reward	You have served me well these past few minutes we've spent together - minutes I shall not soon forget. I believe a reward befitting your unwavering loyalty is in order. You will have the distinct honor of placing Twinkles' favorite toy by his grave in honor of his memory. Please, please - save your thanks for Twinkles; it is not every day that we may honor a horse made of STARS. 
Speak with the Un'Goro Examinant to teleport to The Shaper's Terrace, then speak with Nablya.	The Shaper's Terrace	<As you look into the orb in front of you, you hear a voice.>The crystal pylons have been activated. A sufficient number of crystals have been gathered. The prerequisites have been met. We are prepared for teleport to The Shaper's Terrace. Speak to me when you are ready, Human. We will consult with The Watcher. 
Obliterate 512 Crazed Gnomes.	Gnomebliteration	I have downloaded my program to the fusion core and have complete control over it. I've created a small pocket of air inside to avoid vaporizing user George. I will yield control of all movement functions so I can dedicate my cycles to keeping the core stable. Go down the hill and neutralize as many of the expedition members as possible. My analysis reveals you might feel... ""guilt"" as a result of such high fatality numbers. User George, you must be assured that expedition members are without hope. 
Accompany Adarrah's caravan into Uldum.	Easy Money	Well, hello there! Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand. The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking! We just need a bit of an escort, what with the bandits and all...You'll accompany us, won't you? You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off! 
Take the third fleet ship to the Broken Shore.	The Battle for Broken Shore	This is your vessel, George. She's a fine ship; been through many a campaign. Speak with the ship's captain when you're ready to depart. Good luck out there. We've received few reports about what's happening at the Broken Shore, but I'd wager King Varian has matters well in hand. 
Kill Kolkar centaur until Krom'zar appears, then slay him and take a Piece of Krom'zar's Banner.	Counterattack!	The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened. I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance. My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west! Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens. Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears. Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof. We're counting on you, George. 
Slay the Avatar of Soggoth at the Master's Glaive.	The Battle for Darkshore	The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, George. I can see through their eyes even as we speak. The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth. Destroy it before it's too late, George. I am needed elsewhere. Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further. 
Bring the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot.	Find OOX-17/TN!	You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing! I will reward you for its recovery! Please take this beacon to the robot. Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you! It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"" 
Smear Pagle's Fish Paste, Extra Strength on yourself, then swim into Tidefury Cove.	Nat's Bargain	So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes. But you want to know about Tethyr. I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet. Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works! 
Use the tailgun to defend the Schnottz Bomber.	Tailgunner!	Okay, I've softened this guy up, how about you help me finish him off? I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck. You up for it, George? Just follow my lead... 
Return the pamphlet to Jartsam at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus.	Learn to Ride in Darnassus	This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Jartsam. Jartsam can be found at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. 
Locate Herezegor Flametusk at the Wyvern's Tail inn within the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar, and obtain a Twilight Highlands Coastal Chart.	Unfamiliar Waters	The Warchief has designs to launch an all-out assault on the Twilight Highlands. Once there we hope to ally with the Dragonmaw orcs. Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors. His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways. Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor... 
Do a silly dance for Ruumbo.	Dance for Ruumbo!	You have done well, Human! Ruumbo is pleased by your bravery, and the delicious honey you have given Ruumbo. Now, you must... you must dance! Yes! Dance for Ruumbo! Dance! 
Speak to Hallegosa.	The Stuff of Legends	It is an honor to make your acquaintance, Human. Your deeds echo in the ears of Azeroth's creatures, mortal and immortal alike. I shall present the heart of Ragnaros to Kalecgos when he arrives. Its power is to be harnessed to further endow your weapon. The ceremony is to begin shortly. I have been appointed to escort you there when you are ready. 
Help Maximillian of Northshire kill the Devilsaur Queen. If you become separated from Maximillian, meet him at Golakka Hot Springs in Un'Goro Crater.	The Ballad of Maximillian	The time we have waited for is upon us, Squire George. Un'Goro's brood mother will perish at my hands. The gravity of our task weighs heavily on me, but with the power of the Light behind us, we are guaranteed to succeed. Are you ready to depart? 
Kill the soulless body of Oben Rageclaw, and then use the Voodoo Charm.	Druid of the Claw	After examining this charm, George, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask. You are to approach the door to the nearby chamber. Inside, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the Gnarlpine. In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form. Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me. 
Visit Alliance forces in Stormwind Harbor.	To Be Prepared	Allies from across Azeroth have come to Stormwind to support our efforts against the Burning Legion. Before you ship out, you should pay them a visit. Every bit of preparation helps! 
Capture a neutral hill in the Fields of Blood and defend it against a Horde counter-attack.	A Line in the Dirt	Strategically, control of a region requires constant observation. See here on this map - I've identified a number of strategic hills, similar to this one, that the Alliance must acquire if we are to keep the enemy under our thumb. My scouts have already marked their location on the field. What I need is someone to spearhead their capture, and you're the <man/woman> for the job. Seek out neutral grey flags on hills to the north, east, and south of the Taurajo Ruins. Capture one and defend it! 
Use the Bootlegger Bug Bait to capture a Hazzali Swarmer.	A Great Idea	Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid. What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope! Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit. 
Kill Sunscale raptors and collect their feathers. Use the feathers on the 3 Sunscale Nests.	Into the Raptor's Den	The hunt deepens, George. Now you must find and defeat your prey within its lair. Hunt the Sunscale raptors to the south, where they have built a warren amongst the hills just off of the road. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the sunscale raptor nests to show their brethren you do not fear them! Be cautious, Mechanic. Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious. 
Hear the moral of Shin Stonepillar's story.	The Wolf and The Kodo	My ""associate"" here has some plans for you that I don't agree with. His actions are hasty, uncontrolled, and irresponsible, and you may end up paying for them with your life. Before you work with Gor, first listen to the tale that I have to tell. It's a moralistic story - a fable - but I believe its lesson will prove valuable. Speak to me when you are ready. 
Speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town.	Finding Your Way	Stormwind has a lot to offer adventurers like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The captain has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around. She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there. Have no worries, George! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go. Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town! 
Collect 1 Salvaged Strongbox.	Recover the Cargo!	Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though. The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce. 
Go to the top of the northern tower in Desolation Hold and help Warlord Bloodhilt ""Relieve"" Gar'dul of command.	Changing of the Gar'dul	When Bloodhilt arrives, I'd like to - ah - talk in private. Can you accompany me to make sure things stay on the level? This Bloodhilt is a, ah, he's a, he's a loose cannon.<Gar'dul tries to compose himself.>Meet me atop the northern tower and we'll talk with Bloodhilt together. 
Speak to Kadrak at Mor'shan Ramparts and accompany him to Splintertree Post.	To the Rescue!	You're coming with me, George. There's no one else that I can spare, and we cannot afford for Splintertree to be lost. Prepare yourself, and speak to me again when you are ready. 
Grab a giant-sized laxative from the gnomish tower in the Ruined Reaches. Try to feed the laxative to Gormungan the giant.	Azsharite Experiment Number One	Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a ... massive ... laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there? Our intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan! 
Defeat Agogridon.	Death to Agogridon	Our goal is within sight, George! We can break the will of this demon army by bringing down the one who leads them. If we can succeed, Desolace will be ours! When you are ready, lead a group of centaurs through the pass to the south, into Shadowbreak Ravine. Find where Agogridon hides! I will gather the other khans and meet you there to face him in battle. 
Take the Heart of the Forest to Hamuul Runetotem at the Grove of Aessina in Mount Hyjal.	Aessina's Miracle	<The finger-like branches of one of Nordu's burning limbs part, revealing an untouched, glimmering seed.>This is the Heart of the Forest. The seed of life. Take this to your Arch Druid at Aessina's Grove - Hamuul Runetotem will know how to invoke its power. I promise you, the wilderness spirit will be silent no longer. New life will bloom from the ashes of old. Thank you, Human. My time is done. 
Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts.	Identifying the Brood	Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home. Why the puzzled stare, George? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre? Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil... 
Slay 5 Felstalkers and obtain the Burning Blade Medallion.	Burning Blade Medallion	Through my divinations, I see that an item of power--a medallion--hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic. We must have it. For too long these demon-worshippers have defiled our homelands. Cleanse the coven of its demonic taint by slaying the fel beasts and their leader. Return with this medallion as proof of your deed. Go, George. You will find the coven in a cave to the north. 
Take Myzerian's Head to Sullah at Sullah's Sideshow.	Myzerian's Head	The head of one of Deathwing's most formidable black dragons is now in your possession. While many in Azeroth would pay dearly for such an artifact, something tells you that it belongs in a museum for all to see and remember. Harrison Jones is likely to have the proper connections. Sullah would certainly be happy to deliver it to him. 
Speak to Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to secure transportation to Moonglade.	Warchief's Command: Mount Hyjal!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade. Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground! Speak with Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to gain entry into Moonglade. Blackhoof is located at the tauren district in the Valley of Wisdom in Orgrimmar. Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls! 
Speak to Durak in Splintertree Mines.	Dread Head Redemption	I sense that Durak is more than he seems. Demonic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained warlock. I do not trust him, George. Find this Durak and tell him that the Horde will have nothing to do with him. 
Assemble the Samophlange Manual.	Read the Manual	Back when I was in the Tinker's Union, Boss Copperplug was the best engineer we had. He defected to the Venture Company shortly before I left, and took his greatest techniques with him. He hoarded his secrets, doling out bits and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle. If he built the samophlange, then he's probably got the manual. Last I heard, he was operating right here, out of Boulder Lode mine to the northeast. Get the manual from him, and collect the pages from his followers. 
Speak with Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris.	Hero's Call: Uldum!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. Be one of the first to enter glorious Uldum and claim its treasures in honor of the Alliance! You can reach Adarrah's caravan by traveling to the western reaches of Tanaris. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
	War at Sea	 
Speak to Elthyn Da'rai at the Illidari camp atop the plateau in Orgrimmar.	Keep Your Friends Close	The Legion is bold indeed to strike at the Horde's stronghold! You aided our defense, but now I have a more important task for you. It seems the demon hunters will play a crucial part in this war... but I still don't trust them. You will be my envoy to the Illidari. Learn what they know. Study their techniques. If they betray us, we'll use their own knowledge against them. Their camp lies atop the plateau in the city. Go. Nathanos and I will clean up this mess. 
Speak to Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove in Mount Hyjal.	Protect the World Tree	<Ysera's eyes look distant, as if not fully acknowledging you.>I feel it as well, Mechanic. Ragnaros has arrived. We must defeat his minions before he can join them and lend them his strength. Seek Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove, west of here, and aid his forces in any way you can. I must seek answers from within the Emerald Dream. You must protect the World Tree until I return. 
Krakle in Un'Goro Crater wants you to find the hottest area of Fire Plume Ridge. Whenever you find a hot spot, use the thermometer to check the temperature. Keep looking until you find the hottest one.	Finding the Source	I created a thermometer to take readings of the temperatures at the volcano, and I'd like to find the hottest lava flows. It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit! Here, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot! Hot spots usually take the form of a glowing, rocky pillar jutting out of the ground. You'll find them around the base of Fire Plume Ridge... one trip around the perimeter will likely suffice. 
Locate any refugees from Auberdine that are still alive.	The Last Wave of Survivors	It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time. The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not. Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it. 
Use the mortars to defeat Tethyr.	Take Down Tethyr!	Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars. I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention. 
Bring the Tool Kit and Damaged Diving Gear to Renn McGill in the Dustwallow Marsh.	Secondhand Diving Gear	There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative ""borrowing"" first. Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time! 
Seek out Nordu, an Ancient of Lore, at the Flamewake in Mount Hyjal.	The Last Living Lorekeeper	You have awakened the ancients, George, but the wilderness spirit Aessina remains silent. With her help, we can turn the tide of this attack and undo the damage Twilight's Hammer has done. There may be one who can help us. The oldest of the trees, Nordu, stood in the center of what is now the Flamewake for thousands of years. His wisdom is as old as this mountain. If that old tree still lives, perhaps he can awaken Aessina... seek him out. 
Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. Kill 10 Twilight Lancers by flying into them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!	Vigilance on Wings	The agents of Twilight continue their assault within this pocket of the Firelands. We must not let our offensive fall! Take wing, and destroy as many of those lancers as you can! Do not forget to pick up and equip your lance first. 
Guardian Gurtar wants you to give the Bloodcup Braid to Draaka in Splintertree.	Gurtar's Request	I have a bit of a personal request for you, Mechanic. It has been many moons since I have seen my love, Draaka. It will be many more before we are able to be together again. I fear that as time passes, her love for me will wane. This braid has special meaning to the two of us, as do Thorned Bloodcups, the flower of this region. I ask that you pluck the flowers and weave them into this twine, then present the gift to Draaka on my behalf. 
Return this pamphlet to Aalun outside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.	Learn to Ride at the Exodar	This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Aalun. Aalun can be found at the entrance to the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle. 
Hide behind the Neferset Frond and Uncover the Neferset Secret.	Traitors!	Please, stranger. You must help me. I came here to investigate the arrival of a powerful ally to the Neferset, only to be betrayed by my closest allies and given up to the enemy. Go to the terrace above us to the east and find the information I failed to uncover. You'll need to hide from the Neferset. Perhaps you can hide behind one of the large plants on the platform to conceal your presence. Do this for me and I will help your friends find their way to safety. 
Retrieve the Stonemaul Banner from within the Den of Flame.	Banner of the Stonemaul	When the dragons came and took over Brogg's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner. Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends. Brogg's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, George. 
Talk to Narain Soothfancy to pilot the Mind-Controlled Swarmer into the Gaping Chasm hive.	Just Trying to Kill Some Bugs	Now it's time for my plan to go into full effect. We've got the captured bug strapped up with as many explosives as it can carry, and with Soothfancy's mostly amazing mental powers, we're gonna drive that sucker straight down into the center of the underground hive. And then...BOOM! No more bugs! You get the personal honor of directin' the ugly thing. Go talk to Narain and get set up with your bug-pal. 
You are to scour the Valley of Spears to find 6 Defiled Relics.	While You're Here	The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on. One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled. The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts. 
Khan Leh'prah wants you to place the Spear of the Kolkar Khan in the Fatherstone and defend it from the Magram until Khan Kammah appears. Speak to Khan Leh'prah when you are ready to ride to the battle site.	Delicate Negotiations	There is but one way to win the trust and loyalty of the Magram. It must be beaten out of them. They have suffered many losses in their war against my clan. They now possess an unfamiliar land, where they struggle just to feed themselves. Now is the time to strike. Speak to me when you are ready, then ride in and plant my spear in the Fatherstone. If we can kill enough of them, their Khan will submit to our will. 
Pull the levers behind Nablya and complete her tests.	Ever Watching From Above	When my master Khaz'Goroth shaped the world you call Azeroth, he designed Un'Goro Crater to be an area for experimentation. You might call it the Titans' petri dish. If you seek further knowledge about the methods in which we observe the world, pull the four levers behind me and complete my tests. 
Kill 7 Gnarlpine Mystics and find the missing jewel.	Ferocitas the Dream Eater	The emerald... It is missing! My dreamcatcher has been damaged! There is a band of Gnarlpine mystics located to the north of Starbreeze. I have heard reports that their leader, Ferocitas the Dream Eater, has been wearing a necklace that glows green in the night. Now seeing my dreamcatcher, I am sure that he has stolen my emerald... He would never realize that its power is useless to him. Find this missing jewel, George. And, while you're there, clear out some of the corrupted mystics as well. 
Look for Fleep at her junkyard within Bilgewater Harbor in Azshara.	Ready the Air Force	I gave Hellscream my personal guarantee that I'd have his airfleet ready this week, but our flagship - The Spear of Durotar - still doesn't have its primary engines installed. Fleep promised me a dangerously shiny new engine last week. Go to her junkyard behind the bank and find out what the holdup is. The airfleet is waiting on us, George! 
Schnottz wants you to bring him the Desert Fox.	The Desert Fox	Zhere is much to be done in zhis region, Human. Ve bozh haf a burning passion for zhe ancient technologies here, do ve not? Perhaps zhere is a vay for us to vork togezher? Let us put zhe misunderstandinks of zhe past behind us zhen, hmm? Now, zhere is an elusive animal in zhe region to zhe east zhat I have been huntink. Brink me zhis creature as a token of your sincerity, hmm? Zhen maybe I let you in on my operation... 
Obtain 6 Burning Blade Spellscrolls from members of the Burning Blade in Dustwind Cave.	The Burning Blade	I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar. To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits. I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes. I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work. If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls. The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge. 
	The Sprouted Fronds	 
Retrieve the Relics of Wakening.	The Relics of Wakening	Gnarlpine invaders were seen ravaging the Ban'ethil Barrow Den, tucked in the hill to the west. The slumbering druids will be trapped in the Emerald Dream for eternity, unaware of their fate, unless we help. The delicate hibernation ritual cannot be broken without the Relics of Wakening. Journey to the Den and retrieve the Raven Claw Talisman, Black Feather Quill, Sapphire of Sky, and Rune of Nesting. The druids store them in sacred chests. Return them to me and I will prepare the awakening ritual. 
Slay the insane druids: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak.	Insane Druids	The druids are dead, killed by their leaders who were driven insane by the Horde tainting the Forest Heart! I can feel the corruption even from here and I dare go no further. While I am too well attuned to Ashenvale and the Forest Heart, you... you could descend into the barrow den and do what must be done. I've laid down breadcrumbs for you in there. Though it tears me apart, I must ask that you put to rest the druids' once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak. 
Collect 10 Corrupted Pelts from Angerclaw Bears or Felpaw Wolves.	Culling the Corrupted	The sickening corruption of demons pervades this entire forest. The soil, the trees, the animals... all grow thick with fel magics. We of the Emerald Circle have sworn to cleanse this forest, and doing so requires a constant battle. While some life here can still be healed, the bears and wolves that wander nearby have been twisted too far. We must end their suffering, and ensure their bodies do not spread the taint further. Hunt the bears and wolves, and return to me with their hides. 
Gather a Seed of the Earth, a Seed of the Sea, and a Seed of the Sky.	The Seeds of Life	Something is trying to devour the life of Darkshore from within! I'll ask around to learn more about the - thing - you discovered in the lake. Meanwhile, we need to protect the local wildlife from further harm. Can you gather some materials for me? I'll need life in all its incarnations. Talk to Onu here in the grove to acquire a Seed of the Earth. Capture a Darkshore Wisp floating amongst the trees and we'll have a Seed of the Sky. Find a Seed of the Sea within seashells along the coast, west of here. 
Wear the Ambassador Disguise and talk to Andorel Sunsworn to teleport into Blackmaw Hold. Speak with Ungarl to wreck the negotiations, then kill 4 Blackmaw Warriors and 4 Blackmaw Shaman on your way out.	The Blackmaw Doublecross	Andorel here has crafted a little bit of magic for me. Come, stand next to my fire, and steep yourself in the fumes from the tea. Drape the robes around you and you'll take on the appearance of a night elven ambassador to the Blackmaw. Don your disguise and speak to Andorel here in camp. He'll teleport you to the heart of Blackmaw hold, where the negotiations are to take place. Speak with Chieftain Ungarl and sabotage the treaty. Then, kill as many Blackmaw as you can on the way back! 
	Remembrance of Auberdine	 
Fill the vial at the moonwell in Whisperwind Grove and pour it on the ground between the dead ancient protectors in Irontree Woods.	Nature and Nurture	The ancient protectors of Irontree Woods to the north have been dead for years, their bodies a grim symbol of the damage to these lands. Every season, we take the water from this moonwell, and pour it on the ground before them, hoping it will nurture new life. If you'd like, you can deliver the water yourself. It is an excellent opportunity for reflection. Take this vial and fill it at the moonwell, and pour it on the very top of the small hill between the three ancients. 
	Mending Old Wounds	 
Use your Personal Arcane Assistant to turn 12 Legash demons into insects and then squash them.	Trouble Under Foot	Look at you. Doing errands. Quite responsible of you. You're moving up up up, you are... up up! There be demons ahead! Demons of many unpleasant kinds. Demons that would quite like your innards! Legash demons of a southeasternly heading! But do not worry. No no, no reason to worry, for I shall provide you with a companion! Point, bugify, squash. Point, bugify, squash! Quite efficient. Quite messy too... but again, worry not. No no, worry not, for afterwards, we don't have to clean up! 
Bring Tonga's Eyes to Thunderhead Summit southwest of Ratchet.	A Growing Problem	An explosion of life from barren soil... My companion Jerrik has described similar events happening elsewhere in the Barrens. I shall have to see this for myself, but I cannot abandon my post. Here, George, I will loan you my 'eyes.' My eagle companion here has served me since I was named. Please accompany him to Thunderhead Summit, where Jerrik awaits, and we will investigate. To get to the peak, follow the road east out of the Crossroads. Turn south when you reach a large stone scrawled with paintings. 
Plant 10 dynamite bundles.	It's a Sabotage	The Horde has wasted no time in shamelessly extracting this mysterious ore from the great wound. Luckily for us, goblin engineering is not nearly as sophisticated as what we create in Gnomeregan! All it takes is a little bit of old fashioned dynamite to completely disable a goblin shredder. What unsophisticated machinery! Take these dynamite bundles and plant them on the inactive shredders around the mining camp. It'll take those greedy goblins weeks to get back up and running again! 
Confront and slay Alysra at the Ruins of Lar'donir in Mount Hyjal.	The Fallen Guardian	Fandral Staghelm was kept prisoner here in Hyjal. It was the green dragon Alysra - one of my very own! - who was in charge of keeping Fandral secure. We can only conclude that the Twilight's Hammer has gotten to her. You must confront her, George. Destroy her if you must - I cannot bear to see it. She was last seen in the Ruins of Lar'donir, west of the World Tree. 
Speak with Allari the Souleater.	Emissary	As if things weren't unsettled enough, guests have arrived... the Illidari. These demon hunters have been imprisoned since their master's fall at the Black Temple. For the Wardens to release them can only mean the peril is dire indeed. Their delegation's leader, Allari ""the Souleater,"" claims Orgimmar faces a hidden threat. I gave them leave to establish a camp within the city... for now. You will speak with her at once. Find out whether this threat is credible. 
Vin wants you to collect 5 Windswept Balloons from Stormwind.	Blown Away	Please, <mister/miss>, you just gotta help me! Father bought me a bunch of balloons from the Darkmoon Faire. They're magical, you know, and never lose their floatiness! There's just one thing...A gust of wind blew them out of my hands. They're scattered all over Stormwind! I'd chase after them myself, but this city's so big I'd get lost for sure. Can you find them for me before they float away? Please? 
Plant the Stonemaul Banner near the entrance to Onyxia's Lair and defeat anyone who answers.	Challenge to the Black Flight	Brogg relishes the thought of taking his revenge on the black dragonkin of the marsh. George, you have been very helpful in preparing for this moment. Will you help? Take Brogg's clan banner and travel east until you see a cave like a dragon's mouth. At the entrance to that cave, plant Stonemaul banner and issue Brogg's challenge to Onyxia. Brogg and the Stonemaul will have their lands back! 
Escort Kristoff out of Gar'gol's Hovel.	Get Me Outta Here!	<You reach up to unfasten Kristoff's bonds.>Good! Make a break for the exit, and I'll follow. If we get separated, check back here to make sure I haven't been recaptured. 
Bring the Defias Orders to Renn McGill in the waters off the Dreadmurk Shore.	Renn McGill	From the wording of the orders you recovered, it looks like the first priority of the Defias will be to locate and secure whatever cargo they possessed. SI:7 has had a salvage diver named Renn McGill working out of Theramore for some time. When he heard about the shipwreck, Renn went north to dive near the islands the Defias now occupy. If we're to beat the Defias to this cargo, we'll need his help. Look for him in the waters northeast of a small island just north of the island you visited earlier. 
Slay 7 Grimtotem Marauders.	The Grimtotem are Coming	This is going to take a while, but I'm sure we'll beat them back. You're more good to Thousand Needles elsewhere. We have reports that the gnomes and goblins out on the flooded salt flats somehow survived on a giant barge! Rendow is on the dock. She'll get you a boat to go there. Mind helping us out a little on your way to her? 
Reignite the Ancient Brazier and obtain the Sacred Flame.	The Ancient Brazier	What do we have here? A Human? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises? You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to. Since you are here, I will put you to use. When the waters rushed in, the great water spirit, Aquarian, doused the Ancient Brazier deep inside of Splithoof Hold. Use this brand to reignite the brazier. Aquarian is sure to come. Bring me the Sacred Flame. 
Kill a Triumph Captain on the far side of the Battlescar and acquire a Fresh Brain.	Smarts-is-Smarts	My monstrosity is taking shape! All that's left is to stuff his skull with something useful. I'm talking about brains, George. And here I'm going to be picky. The abomification process causes significant brain damage so it's best to start with someone smart. One of the Alliance officers should do nicely. Seek out one of the Captains on the far side of the Battlescar and try not to damage the goods while you kill him. 
Extract the soul of Mad Magus Tirth.	The Mad Magus	There's only one ting left dat we can do. Ya gotta slay someone with the big mojo in Tony's presence. No, not me! Ol' Magus Tirth went crazy when he tried ta stop the waters rushin' in at the Cataclysm. Now he be hauntin' the area just south of the Holdfast. Take dis soul stick an' use it on his corpse, mon. Then bring Tony back an' we be gettin' him back in his body. Ya can use me spirit portal ta get down there an' back. 
Take the Krom'gar Wagon to the Fold in Stonetalon Mountains.	We're Here to Do One Thing, Maybe Two...	You're in Hellscream's army now, George, and in Hellscream's army we kick butt and take names. Gone are the days of our people starving in the streets of Orgrimmar as we sign treaties with elves. We take what we need now. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde! The Alliance attempts to stop our expansion every chance they get. Unsatisfied with owning most of the Eastern Kingdoms, those pig-lickers want it all! Overlord Krom'gar has called for more troops in Stonetalon. Get on the caravan west of here and go! 
Captain Goggath wants you to use Tweedle's Improvised Explosives to kill 20 Astranaar Sentinels and destroy 10 Astranaar Throwers.	Blastranaar!	So, Tweedle finally came through on those explosives, eh? They couldn't have come at a better time. The elves of Astranaar are preparing to make a devastating assault on our camp as we speak. Drop our new weapon on them from the skies! The destruction of Astranaar will be a dagger in the heart of night elves everywhere! Speak with Thraka when you're ready to begin the assault. Aim true, Mechanic. 
Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. Smash 40 Firelands Eggs by running over them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!	Egg Wave	Without any defenders, the Firelands eggs are vulnerable. Take wing once more and smash those eggs! Simply rush over them to crush them. Search all the nooks, crannies, and side-caves. Hurry! 
Use the Enormous Bird Call at one of Blaithe's Nests perched atop the Rim of the World. Kill Blaithe and gather one of his Ancient Feathers.	A Prayer and a Wing	A winged visage? Could it be...?George, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us. I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief. Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers. 
Priestess Valishj wants you to find the Ancient Engravings of Neptulon.	Deep Impact	Queen Azshara seeks entrance into the plane of water, for what I do not know. She believes that the ancients held the keys to finding its location. I have personally been charged with scouring the ruins in this region, and none shall rest until we discover the secrets we seek! Submerged just to the north are a concentration of ruins. Use this staff to search through the rubble. Return to me only when you have located that which we seek! 
Fly to Hyjal using Aronus and speak to Ysera once you're there.	As Hyjal Burns	George! We've heard much about you and your previous accomplishments. It is good that you've come here just as Azeroth finds itself in a time of great need. Deathwing's minions are attacking Hyjal and seek to bring the destructive Ragnaros back into our world. Aronus will take you to join Malfurion's forces in Hyjal. Lend them what help you can. 
Defeat Zakkaru and collect the Sealed Sang'Thraze.	Sang'thraze the Deflector	The blood speaks. I can feel its flow through the sand...drenched in death, a desert of suffering...<Mazoga's eyes roll back in his head.>There! The blood flows to the south, in a valley of bones. Zakkaru! Zakkaru, spawn of Makkari, the dark one who demands sacrifice... his father forced from Zul'Farrak, his ascension interrupted... he will taste blood once more...<Mazora reels.>Go, Mechanic. Zakkaru has Sang'thraze. Ya not be wanting him to keep it, trust me. 
Use your fishing skill to obtain 4 Darkshore Grouper.	A Taste for Grouper	Between boat rides and building, I'm exhausted... and hungry. You know what sounds tasty? Fish. Fish sound delicious. Darkshore is known for its grouper. If you fish me up some, I'll make it worth your time. 
Obtain a Bottle of Wildfire and throw it at Bathran's Corpse to burn it.	Of Their Own Design	These creatures... these so-called Horde... they have cut me down in my prime and they are harvesting my hair for their evil plans. Will you help me to put an end to it, little Human? I have overheard their herbalists speaking of something called wildfire upon their table across the way. If you were to take the bottle of this unnatural stuff and throw it at my corpse to the northeast, it would burn and no more of my hair will grow here. I am already dead and it is a small price to pay to stop them. 
Use Garl's Net to obtain 4 Bloodpetal Seeds.	Carried on the Waves	The Bloodpetals of Un'Goro have a fascinating life cycle. These trees in front of us bear seeds that fall down into the river when they mature. The river's current then takes the seed north of here, where the seed hatches - almost like an egg - and a newborn Bloodpetal emerges. I require these seeds for my studies. Take this net, and use it to scoop up the bright orange seeds in the river. You'll have to hunt them down under the water. 
Mai'Lahii wants you to kill Blubbergut.	Blubbergut	Ahoy, mon! You think you be able ta do something for da village here? Most whales we can handle fine, but there be a special whale out there that be too big for our spears. Blubbergut been gettin' bigger an' bigger - eatin' up the fish we use to live on! Get out there and find the thing, then make him pay for his gluttony! 
Slay Lord Banehollow.	Lord Banehollow	Only one final power remains lurking in the depths of Shadow Hold now: Lord Banehollow. The Shadow Council here serves his whims, and even Fel'dan was a mere instrument for him to prepare this land for another invasion of the Burning Legion. Proceed carefully, George. A dreadlord is a terrifying foe. Stand tall and triumph! 
Kill Supervisor Fizsprocket and collect Fizsprocket's Clipboard.	Supervisor Fizsprocket	According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands. The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the Venture Co. mine east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful. 
Obtain the Defias Orders from Garn Mathers.	Defias in Dustwallow?	My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas... the symbol of the Defias! The reports indicate their leader resides on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession. 
Gather up Stonebloom, Bitterblossom, and a Darkflame Ember.	From the Mouth of Madness	I know of a draught that should jolt these gibbering former slaves back to reality. Gather some stonebloom from the rocks around Gar'gol's hovel, some bitterblossom from the shores of the nearby lake, and a darkflame ember from one of the braziers at the hovel entrance. The draught won't last long, so combine the ingredients at a twilight cauldron by the entrance to the hovel. One sip of that draught should knock some sense into the brainwashed slaves! 
You are to find Kherrah somewhere behind the doors to Maraudon.	Behind Closed Doors	You've discovered the location of Khan Shodo's daughter, Kherrah. She is being held behind the doors to Maraudon! The rescue attempt is certain to be risky, but if you seek the Gelkis clan's cooperation, you must free the Khan's daughter. 
Bring a Flatland Cougar Femur to Maur Raincaller at Bloodhoof Village.	Mazzranache	My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite. As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I have gathered all the parts of the remedy I need to cure myself... except a flatland cougar femur. I grow weaker by the moment... please, help me. 
Return to Krog at Brackenwall Village.	Justice Dispensed	I doubt the Grimtotems will give up their campaign to drive humans from the marsh, though I get the impression you probably don't mind that. At least we have dealt with the perpetrators of the crimes at the Shady Rest Inn. Go tell your leader that his vengeance has been sated. 
Speak with Warlord Krogg at Bilgewater Port in Azshara.	Where Is My Warfleet?	The Highlands are the home of the Dragonmaw orcs. If we show them our might they would ally with us against the Twilight's Hammer. I am certain! The fleet is gathering at Bilgewater Port in Azshara but there are reports of delays. You did good getting the goblins to work, I need your skills here too. Find Warlord Krogg in Azshara and see what is taking so long. 
Search the bottom of the Forgotten Pools northwest of the Crossroads.	The Forgotten Pools	Have you felt the tremors, Mechanic? Something has cleaved this land in two. But we druids can sense other tremors, as well. Life is stirring in lands once dry and lifeless. The oases around the Crossroads are suddenly blooming. I can sense a power leaking its way to the surface, but from where? Is it related to the disaster that shattered the Barrens? We must find the source. Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads. Search its waters for a source of power, then return here. 
Lure a Twilight Recruit away from the group and take his Twilight Recruitment Papers.	Signed in Blood	You're here at last, George. Just in time as well. News of Ragnaros' emergence has spurred a large wave of recruits to seek membership in the Twilight's Hammer. If you're to infiltrate the cult, the time is now. We will need recruitment papers -- signed in blood by a referring Twilight member. Lure one of the new recruits away from the group and hit them with this blackjack. If you're lucky, you'll be able to steal his recruitment papers. Bring them back to me and we'll do our best to alter them. 
Durak wants you to use the Tainted Blood of the Kaldorei on the Forest Heart.	Pierce Their Heart!	There...The blood of the fallen Kaldorei is turned. It can now be used on the Forest Heart in Dor'Danil Barrow Den. Doing so will utterly corrupt it. The sacred relic of the arrogant elves will be turned against them. How poetic!<Durak laughs cruelly.>The barrow den lies nestled against the hills to the southeast. One of my imps has laid a blood trail from the entrance to the heart. Make haste! Kadrak is not likely to be in a patient mood. Off you go, Mechanic. 
Kill Feegly the Exiled in the Bael Modan Digsite.	Feegly the Exiled	Saddest story I ever heard told, George. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. ""The Tear of the Moons"" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried. Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery. 
Use the powers of the Whirling Vortex to slay Lord Magmathar.	Vortex	The time has come, George. When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak. Channel the power of the Earthen Ring through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more. 
Help Naralex seal the Nightmare Scar.	The Nightmare Scar	This confirms it. The overgrowth here is not being caused by a mere overabundance of energy. Do you understand? This is beyond what happened at the Wailing Caverns now. A rift into the Nightmare must have torn open in the middle of the very land we're standing on! And to think it's my fault...I'm done picking at the edges of this wound. Go to the west, to the center of the overgrowth, and meet me again there. We will dive into the heart of this corruption and force it shut! 
Speak to Cassa Crimsonwing and use one of her gryphons to survey Alcaz Island.	Survey Alcaz Island	It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there. Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air. Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping. 
Plant a Limpet Mine at the thinnest part of the hull of the Bellipotent.	Love it or Limpet	<Gazlowe spreads the plans on the table and jabs a tiny finger aft of the ship below the waterline.>There! The hull is thinnest here, where the crankshaft meets the paddlewheel. And it's right next to the magazine! George, I can't be held responsible if some enterprising Horde Mechanic were to attach a limpet mine to that part of the hull. Not even if I supplied the mine. And paid <him/her>. Handsomely. The ship is anchored just southeast of here... go to it! Then radio me with this stolen gnomecorder. 
Gather 8 Frostsaber Cubs from the dens around Frostsaber Rock.	Get Them While They're Young	I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust. The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub. 
Find Karnitol's Satchel and return it to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.	The Karnitol Shipwreck	Intriguing. Well, we might not be without hope quite yet. Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet. If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches. 
Take the Illegible Correspondence to someone in Orgrimmar.	The Lord Admiral's Lament	The footlocker contains a number of Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore's personal effects. Among them is a rolled letter, sealed with sea-green wax and stamped with the Proudmoore crest. The parchment tears easily and requires careful handling and it appears that the ink has been largely washed away by tide and time. Perhaps someone can restore the letter and reveal its contents. 
Collect 1 Pristine Crystal Shard from the Crystal Spine Matriarch on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale.	Crystal Clarity	Hi again! Oh, I forgot to tell you! I've devised a foolproof way to improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam! In fact, with just the right gemstones, I can make a lens that would allow us to do all sorts of things! Some fellow explorers have told me about a large basilisk out on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale. Her hide is dotted with tons of high-quality crystals! What a perfect coincidence! She sounds pretty tough, though! You should bring some friends! 
Defeat Kelsey Steelspark.	Thunderdrome: Grudge Match!	It seems we have a special request! I have here a note from one Megs Dreadshredder, requesting to enter the cage and settle a dispute. She's asked for you to be her partner, George. A fan of your previous victories? Or perhaps you're acquainted outside the ring? I wouldn't back down now if I were you. This is the grand finale... 
Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to find his beloved Natalia. The information that you gathered points to Hive'Regal in the south as being the area in which you may find Mistress Natalia Mar'alith. Do not forget to visit the dwarves at Bronzebeard's camp before venturing into the hive. They might have some additional work and advice for you. And George, remember the Commander's words: ""Do what you must...""	Into The Maw of Madness	I need you to venture into Hive'Regal and find what became of my dearest Natalia, George. This will be no easy task for you. Before you dive headlong into the maw of madness, make sure that you speak with those dwarves further. They might be able to give you some tips on dealing with the silithid that inhabit that hive. And George, if she truly is as mad as they say... do what you must. 
You're pretty sure that A-Me 01 has asked you to obtain an Un'Goro Coconut, crack it on the rock nearby, and give her the High Viscosity Coconut Milk.	Repairing A-Me 01	<Suddenly, the robotic gorilla's eyes light up, and it begins to speak.>""...operational capacity... less than 5%... accidentally... punctured oil reservoir...""""...use coconut milk... rock... save A-Me 01...""<A-Me closes her eyes.> 
Speak with Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris.	Meetup with the Caravan	The pyramid inside of the Maker's Terrace in Uldum can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on Azeroth.<Harrison thinks a moment.>You need to continue the research you've begun. Head to the southern end of Kalimdor, to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum. Perhaps you can tag along. 
Talk to Matoclaw at the Grove of Aessina in Mount Hyjal.	Good News... and Bad News	<Blackhorn used the power of Thol'embaar's remains to slip his bonds. But at least the inferno seems to be subsiding.><Matoclaw will want to know what happened here. She's waiting for you back at the Grove of Aessina.> 
Track down a Bilgewater Foreman somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor and knock him around a little.	Beating the Market	<It's not hard to see why the Foebreaker is behind schedule. Every other day, a foreman comes in and changes the blueprints.><Most troubling are the recent alterations. The workers have been ordered to remove rivets to save on costs!><You'd better track down one of the Bilgewater foremen responsible for this and make an example out of him, before any Horde lives are lost in a faulty ship.> 
Climb up trees in the Whistling Grove, grab stranded Hyjal Bear Cubs, and then hurl them at the Soft Target from the top of the tree. This is perfectly safe.	The Bears Up There	Do not fear the bears in this grove, Mechanic - I have pacified them for the moment. My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground! Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here. Nothing can go wrong with this plan. 
	The Unwritten Prophecy	 
Take the Crudely-written Log to Kelek Skykeeper at Lake Kel'theril.	Words of the High Chief	The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper. He's a druid that once worked to help cleanse Felwood with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins. You might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently. 
Collect 8 Bathran's Hair.	Bathran's Hair	There is a plant that grows in the old ruins of Bathran's Haunt across the road to the east. The plant is called Bathran's Hair and is known to cure ailments of the spirit. Now the Horde are there harvesting the plant for their own evil schemes. There is a sick child in Astranaar, and we believe that her illness is more than just physical. I promised my master that I would help seek a cure, but I am no fighter. Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and gather the plants? 
Sell Invincible's Reins to Gott Weedlespan for Johnny Awesome.	Service with a Smile	Oh, simple Human. Simple, simple Human. I did not 'forget' to sweep up those reins from that foolish cakewalk of a knight they call the Lich King. I simply did not bother, as I already received the mighty steed during my raid last week.<Johnny motions to the horse on his left.>Since you're here and clearly intrigued by my sweltering greatness, won't you take that superfluous stallion to the assistant resort director in town? My coffers could use a bit of extra lining. 
Use the Grol'dom Net to ensnare a Razormane Pillager and drag it back to Togrik at Grol'dom Farm.	Drag it Out of Them	It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these quilboar invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, George, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me. 
Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold wants you to bring him the Blessed Herb Bundle.	The Bear's Blessing	Before the bear's paw can be used to cleanse the afflicted, it must be completed and blessed. To the north of the village roams a tallstrider named Fleetfoot. You'll need its tailfeathers to complete the herb bundle. Bring the tailfeathers and the bear's paw bundle to the ancient bear statue in the ruins around the Grove of the Ancient, further north of where you'll find Fleetfoot. While at the shrine, combine the tailfeathers with the bear's paw and receive the bear spirit's blessing. 
Gather 4 pieces of Centaur Intelligence from around the Stagnant Oasis.	Flushing Out Verog	Regthar Deathgate sent me here to observe the centaur activity, but the leader of this group is hard to pin down. I've discovered that his name is ""Verog the Dervish,"" but his whereabouts are a mystery. Can you help me do some digging? I know that ""Centaur Intelligence"" sounds like an oxymoron, but their camps are often littered with important communications. Search the centaur tents all around the Stagnant Oasis here and bring me back some info. 
Acquire 8 Smoldering Cores by killing Searing Guardians, then smash them against a Twilight Anvil.	Crushing the Cores	These searing guardians are murderous! We destroy them, and within minutes, they reignite from the ashes. I think there's a way to destroy them permanently, but we'll need someone who can fight through the front ranks. George, kill the searing guardians and take their smoldering cores to the nearby anvils. Smash them on the Twilight Anvils, and destroy them for good! 
Slay Hezrul Bloodmark and collect his head.	Hezrul Bloodmark	Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens. He is fierce, brutal and cunning. Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us. So kill him. Bring me Hezrul's Head, and I will mount it from this outpost, so that they may know fear. Hezrul leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south. 
Commander Schnottz wants you to use the L.P.A.C. to collect 5 Furious Spectral Essences.	Angered Spirits	Doctor Venkman vas vone of my greatest researchers, until he had to be put out of my misery. He did leave me vizh vone of his greatest accomplishments, zhough. Against zhe properly attuned supernatural adversary, zhis veapon vill siphon zhe target's essence. It is of key importance in zhe ritual I vill be attemptink. Vhere do you come in, you ask? Simple. You have zhe priviledge of collecting zhe material. Zhe veapon is calibrated to vork on zhe Furious Specters in zhe temple to zhe east. 
Lead Ringo to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Stand. If Ringo feels weak, slap him. If he faints, use Spraggle's Canteen to revive him.	A Little Help From My Friends	Ugh... It's so hot...I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion. Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Stand. I think I'm well enough to follow you there. I am feeling a little out of it, so you can slap me if I'm feeling woozy. If I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope... 
Seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance to Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal.	The Eye of Twilight	The ogre clan across the lake is led by Gar'gol. I use the term loosely; Gar'gol has the intelligence of raw beef. So far as I can tell, Gar'gol is taking orders from a magical instrument: ""The Eye of Twilight."" He follows its commands unquestioningly. If we can sabotage the eye, we can cause unimaginable havoc. Go to Gar'gol's hovel and seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance. Study it. Find a way to subvert it. Ah, marvelous chaos... 
Give Brann Bronzebeard the contents of the Coffer of Promise.	The Coffer of Promise	I'm not quite certain what ta expect 'ere, so stay on yer toes, eh? These codes should reveal the coffer's true purpose, and present us with the tools to thwart Deathwing's efforts in Uldum fer good! Stand back! 
Find Smoot somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor. Tackle him and get the Induction Samophlange.	Smoot's Samophlange	It was the Captain who insisted his new engines use an induction samophlange. Those things hadn't even been invented yet! I tasked Smoot with creating one based on some stolen Venture Company schematics, and he's finally built a working model. Now that he's got his samophlange, he's drunk with power. He's running all over town with it like a goblin possessed. Smack Smoot and snag my samophlange, George. 
Put 10 Stonemaul Spirits to rest at the Stonemaul Ruins.	Spirits of Stonemaul Hold	Brogg has completed the totem that will put the spirits of his friends to rest. When the dragonkin came, they killed all Stonemaul who did not flee. Brogg fled with Overlord Mok'Morokk, hoping to lead a counterattack with other Stonemaul survivors. The counterattack never came and the spirits of the Stonemaul dead still haunt Brogg and the others. Take this totem north to Stonemaul Ruins and use it near ogre skeletons to draw the spirit to you. Defeat the spirit to give it rest with its bones. 
Use the Orbs of the Stars near the mechanism in the Chamber of the Stars.	Do the Honors	It looks like all that's left to do is to place the orbs on the pedestals at each corner of this mechanism. We appear to have stumbled upon what may be the most important find in modern history.<Harrison looks at you for a moment, then hands you the orbs.>Well, go ahead, George. We'd have never made this discovery without you. 
Investigate the Shady Rest Inn in at the border of the Barrens in Dustwallow Marsh.	Inspecting the Ruins	If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. I had a man placed in that inn as a spy and I don't trust in the competence of these humans to uncover what happened. Whatever you find, don't give a scrap of it to that investigator. We'll handle this ourselves. 
Slay Kona Thunderwalk on the border between Stonetalon and Southern Barrens.	Futile Resistance	George, I certainly don't want to deliver my report to Commander Singleton without at least a little bit of good news. We've got to wrestle control of these roads back from these Horde holdouts. From what we can gather, Kona Thunderwalk is the name of the ringleader. He's got a camp just north of here. A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish. Find and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton! 
Distract Karr'gonn and slay Dark Cultist Azennios at the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal.	Seeds of Discord	According to the intelligence you acquired, there is major friction between the ogres and non-ogres in the cult. High Cultist Azennios and the ogre mage Karr'gonn are meeting at the Seat of the Chosen in an attempt to ease the conflict. There is an outhouse like this one at the Seat of the Chosen. Go there and put on this ogre disguise. Find a way to kill Azennios while he's in this mission of peace. We must exploit this division as much as we can! 
Admiral Odesyus has asked that you find and speak with Captain Edward Hanes.	The Bloodcurse Legacy	Dear friend,My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time. Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago. This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base? Regards,Admiral Odesyus 
Sabotage a Dwarven Artillery Shell and then flee from Bael'Dun before it explodes.	Sabotage!	These dwarven artillery shells have a built-in airburst timer. This is easy! Just sabotage one of the artillery shells in the loading bay and then hoist it up into the magazine. Boom, baby. BOOM! You'll find the shells in one of two loading bays behind the main garage on this level. It's right around the corner. Once you've rigged the artillery shell... Run! Run like the wind, George! Then report to Gann back at camp. I'll be right behind you. 
Smash 30 Sand Pygmies with the Tahret Dynasty Mallet.	Thieving Little Pluckers	I don't have the most glamorous job in the world. I do not concern myself with matters of war or the deep mysteries of the halls of Uldum or what have you. I am in charge of these grounds... and these grounds grow dates. Now, these little date-plucking mongrels have gotten gutsy enough to stand on each other's shoulders to try and steal my precious fruit. I will not stand for this. Take this mallet, crafted by the titans, blessed by the sun-kings and who-knows-what-else and smash the runts! 
Relive Illidan's battle with Arthas.	A Destiny of Flame and Sorrow	My kind has always been hated for what we do... despised outcasts, accused of corruption beyond redemption. Yet if it was not for a demon hunter, these very woods would be the greatest stronghold of the Burning Legion on Azeroth. I speak of my master, Illidan Stormrage, the ""Betrayer"". See for yourself. See what occured here when Illidan was first freed, and the demonic forces of the dreadlord Tichondrius ruled this forest completely unopposed... 
Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in Northern Barrens.	Preserving the Barrens	For years, the Barrens have been the heart of the Horde presence on Kalimdor, a vital link between the orcs of Durotar and the tauren settlements in Mulgore. In the chaos of the cataclysm, floods, earthquakes, and even a quilboar invasion threaten to separate us from this vital grassland. You look ready for a challenge. Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post and ensure the route to the Barrens remains clear! Head west from nearby Razor Hill and cross the Southfury River to find him. 
Obtain 10 Bloodpetal Sprouts.	Here Lies Dadanga	 
Cenarion Researcher Korrah wants you to take Korrah's Report to Karnum at Karnum's Glade.	Official Assessment	You have accomplished much in your efforts against the naga, George. But I fear it is not nearly enough....This is my official assessment of the naga presence. I'm confident that my peers in the wildlands will take the necessary action. Bring this to Karnum at the glade in the center of the Cenarion Wildlands to the southeast. He will know what to do. Thank you, George. And farewell. 
Kill 10 Schnottz Elite Troopers in the Chamber of the Moon.	Schnottz So Fast	I'm nearly ready, George. Your scrolls contained enough information to discern their encryption method. Now all that's left is for me to translate the codes. I need you to scout out the chamber beneath the Obelisk of the Moon. There are likely to be a few of Schnottz's troops down there that escaped your blast. You take care of them and I'll meet you there when I'm finished. 
Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat.	Hungry, Hungry Hatchling	The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion. Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling. 
Speak to the A.I.D.A. terminal at the Surveyor's Outpost in Uldum.	Artificial Intelligence	<A feminine voice addresses you over the portable terminal.>Emergency code: 55-729. Upper cerebral cortex functions in expedition members have been compromised. Please report to your nearest terminal location, to the southeast of the Sunstone Terrace, for further analysis. 
Use the Kodo Concoction near 5 Enraged Kodos.	Calming the Kodo	As you have by now witnessed, the rapid changes to this region can have both positive and negative effects on the native creatures. To the south and east of here, enraged kodo are a constant threat to anyone nearby. It's time to put my theory to the test. I've used the rejuvenated thunder lizard's blood in the making of this concoction. I'm hoping it will soothe the kodo when they eat it. Place it near an enraged kodo and make sure you do it from a safe distance! 
Speak with Vol'jin in Spitescale Cove and aid him in killing Zar'jira, the Sea Witch.	An Ancient Enemy	Da Sea Witch is here, on top of dis very isle.

Let him know when you are ready ta join da battle. 
Go through the portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and aid Cenarius in defeating Ragnaros.	The Firelord	With his gatekeeper gone, you've given the Guardians of Hyjal access to Sulfuron Spire. Ragnaros will have no choice but to defend the main entryway to the Firelands himself. Go through the Twilight's Hammer portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and meet me inside. Malfurion and Hamuul will also aid us while the others continue to fight the enemy outside.

Recover Lady Sathrah's Silvery Spinnerets.	Tears of the Moon	Lady Sathrah was once beloved of Elune. Graceful and pure, the spider spun her silver threads through the moonlight, catching the evening mist. The silvery dew had strong healing powers and was kept at the nearby temple. But of late, Sathrah has descended into madness. Her future generations are now threatened as well. Find Lady Sathrah, George, and end her suffering. She dwells northeast of here, near the river. Gather her silvery spinnerets and bring them back to me. 
Use the Petrified Root to raise 6 Withered Ents and dispatch the naga leader, Lady Janira.	Twice Removed	We cannot condone reckless violence - it is not our nature. However, there are times when the consequences of avoiding battle are too tangible to ignore, as is the case with these naga. When the earth in the area shattered, a small section of ruins rose to our east. These ruins once housed those loyal to Queen Azshara, and it seems her kind have returned in search of something. Take this petrified root. You can use it on their fallen to raise ents to aid you. Deal with them and their leader swiftly. 
Commander Grimfang at Zoram'gar wants you to pour Mystlash Hydra Oil on the lighthouse fire.	Keep the Fires Burning	This is no small task, Human! We have more ships arriving, and without the lighthouse they'll be lost - or worse! You are hereby charged with keeping its fire lit. Collect the blubber from the hydras in these waters, then bring it to the forge here to melt it into oil. Throwing that oil on the lighthouse fire will buy us the time we need. 
Collect 10 Creature Carcasses.	Carcass Collection	These organs be a good start, mon, but we still be needin' lotsa other tings. Normally, we'd be gettin' stuff from family now, but dats only me and my sistah's boy, and Tony ain't worth it! So, we be substitutin' some stuff. Lotsa carcasses, in fact! Deep down in the Shimmering Deep, there's tons of dem from when the water came rushin' in. Killed all of dem creatures. Go down there and bring me up some. 
Obtain the Forest Heart.	The Forest Heart	You must get the Forest Heart to Gnarl at all costs! Down at the bottom of the Dor'Danil Barrow Den it sits, corrupted by the Horde. Only Gnarl can cleanse it. In order to move it, though, you'll need a Power of Nature. If you collect enough untainted spirits from the Severed druids and keepers, the spirits can be combined into a Power of Nature. Good luck, George! 
Help the Aqir Larva emerge from its cocoon in Ramkahen.	They Grow So Fast	Look! Our little larva friend has entered the pupa stage! Wait... it looks like he's ready to emerge. Go on, give him a hand! 
Protect Stormwind Keep from the Legion.	Demons Among Us	The king is wise to focus on the Legion's threat, George. Even now, the demons move against us. The Illidari will aid the cause of the Alliance. We believe they have set their sights on key locations around Azeroth. In fact, they could already be in your midst! I sense they are close... 
Plant the Demon Summoning Torch in the mouth of Grolnar's cave in the Winterfall furbolg village. Defeat the demon and retrieve the Essence of Xandivious for Gorn One Eye in Timbermaw Hold.	The Root of All Evil	George, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them! Take this torch to the mouth of Grolnar's personal cave and plant it there. Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate. This is when you and your allies must strike it down! Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold. 
Deliver the Troll Charm to Raene Wolfrunner at Astranaar in Ashenvale.	Corrupting Influence?	As you search through the belongings of the dead furbolg lying before you, a small charm, very obviously created by trolls, spills out onto the ground. Touching the charm, you immediately get a sense that something is not right about the wood. A feeling of unease, of corruption, permeates the object. Wrapping it in some spare cloth, you put it in your pack and resolve to show it to Raene Wolfrunner when next you find yourself in Astranaar. 
Use Gorat's Imbued Blood on Gorat's corpse, then defeat Captain Elendilad.	Gorat's Vengeance	Fortune is with us this day, Human. Gorat's blood was fresh enough for me to conduct a special ritual taught to me as a child. Use this imbued blood on Gorat's corpse to summon forth his lingering spirit. Do his final bidding, then report back here to Kadrak. Spirits keep you safe, friend. 
Guardian Menerin wants you to deliver the Sealed Missive to Guardian Gurtar.	Sheelah's Last Wish	I... I cannot believe she's gone. It all happened so fast....I understand that I have you to thank for avenging my mistress. For that, you have my gratitude, and that of Silvermoon. In her wisdom, my lady foresaw this end. She prepared a missive to be delivered in the event that something happened to her. We were to join an Orgrimmar retinue at the crossroads just north of here. Please, Human, meet them in our stead and see that the message is delivered. 
Go to Grommash Hold and learn the fate of the Horde.	Fate of the Horde	It is a wonder any of our troops survived that bloodbath on the Broken Shore. If not for Lady Sylvanas...High Overlord Saurfang has been asking for you at Grommash Hold. He will not say why... but he was insistent that I send you to him. 
Kill Goreclaw the Ravenous and report to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.	WANTED: Goreclaw the Ravenous	Travelers and Steamwheedle personnel working in the field are advised to avoid the Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. The area is overrun with raptors lead by the cruel and cunning Goreclaw the Ravenous, who has already killed at least two Steamwheedle engineers. Drazzit Dripvalve has authorized a generous reward to be paid to the individual who rids Mudsprocket of this menace. 
Deliver the Barrel of Oil to Fizzle Brassbolts on Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge in Thousand Needles.	Deliver the Goods	Alright, George, I need you to get this oil back to Fizzle on the Speedbarge, and let him know the good news! 
Deliver the Sealed Package to the Darkspear Loyalist on the docks at Bladefist Bay in Durotar.	Warchief's Emissary	The goblins and the Horde have accomplished too much together to part ways now, Mechanic. I intend for the Bilgewater Cartel to become part of the Horde. I have something that I want you to deliver to the new warchief. Give this package to my Darkspear friend on the dock at Bladefist Bay in Durotar. She will help you to get into Orgrimmar safely. Speak with Sassy Hardwrench on the ship when you are ready to set sail. Until we meet again. Aka'Magosh, a blessing on you and yours, George! 
Place the Raptor Bait near the windmill in Blackhoof Village.	Unleash the Raptors	Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to ""encourage"" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest. I've got a leftover haunch of... well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took. 
Acquire the Broken Goggles.	Lessons From the Past	This unfortunate explorer has clearly suffered a bit of bad luck in the recent past. Prudence dictates that you perform the unenviable task of searching the corpse for clues that might shed light on your surroundings... 
Rescue the Dweller by the Shore, the Dweller in the Cliffs, and the Dweller of the North.	Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved	I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater. My paladin's instinct tells me that there are townsfolk nearby that require our aid. Those in distress cannot be ignored. Let us sally forth, Squire George! The people of Un'Goro require our aid! 
Take the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot in a cave near Feral Scar Vale.	Find OOX-22/FE!	You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed! I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it is in a cave near Feral Scar Vale!"" 
Question Orgrimmar Skyway Peons around the Zeppelin Towers. Look for any Suspicious Peons. Try to flush out Sauranok the Mystic and kill him.	Traitor's Bait	The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.<Eitrigg pulls you aside.>I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, George. The Twilight's Hammer has placed their agents within the ranks of the workers at the airship docks to spread their lies across the land. Speak with them. If you find evidence of Sauranok's guilt then show him what happens to traitors of the Horde. 
Slay Commander Jarrodenus in Talrendis Point and collect his head.	The Conquest of Azshara	George! Was it you who piloted the wind rider who bombed the command center? It was a direct hit! My scouts tell me that you gravely wounded Jarrodenus, flight master of the night-elven skychasers and de facto commander of the opposition. The opportunity to strike is now - I don't have time to assemble a full assault. Rush the command center building and kill Commander Jarrodenus before his backup arrives. Bring me his head... and Azshara is ours! 
Use the Modified Soulstone to capture a Gordok ogre.	Ogre Abduction	This is neither a crude ogre trinket, nor an ancient relic made by my kind. Its specific construction is new to me...and this fact disturbs me greatly. The wolf-girl will be sending you to Dire Maul soon, to fight the Gordok elite. They are the leaders of the Gordunni, and would know who is supplying these. Take the orb back, I've cast a few enchantments on it. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here. 
Follow and protect Demolitionist Legoso as he attempts to destroy the Vector Coil and slay Sironas. Return to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch should you complete the mission.	Ending Their World	Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well. I won't think less of you if you just walk away, George. But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you? 
Collect 8 Lightning Rod Components from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	A Shocking Technique	I have heard tales that the mogu use lightning to speed up the growth of their cloud serpents. I wonder if the same principle could be used for our aqir friend? There's only one way to find out! Go to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and see if you can get the parts together so we can create our own lightning rods. If they work the same as they do for the cloud serpents, it should speed up the hatching process significantly. 
Hermit Ortell wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts.	True Believers	Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you. My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis. If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer. Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share. Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members. 
Collect 5 Crossroads Supply Crates from inside the Razormane cave.	Supplies for the Crossroads	Whatever has happened in Southern Barrens is causing some of the quilboar tribes to flee our direction. The displaced Razormane in particular grow desperate, and their attacks grow bolder. I've lost two caravans this week alone! Our warriors at the Crossroads desperately need those supplies, and I'm not about to let the quilboar grow fat off of their misdeeds. Find the missing supply crates and bring them to me. I'd search the quilboar hovel south of here, along the river. 
Bring the Head of Nefarian to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in Stormwind.	The Lord of Blackrock	The old feeling returns. The welcome pangs of victory reverberate throughout your being. Before you lies the monolithic, battle scarred head of Nefarian. Bring it to the Grand Admiral on the King's behalf, champion. 
Utilize a Vengeful Protector to kill 30 Shatterspear trolls and destroy 6 Shatterspear Structures.	The Ancients' Ire	Come to join the offensive? If you're looking for Sandrya Moonfall, she's leading the attack on the Shatterspear leader at the cave in the back of the vale, you can meet her there. While you're here though, we could certainly use your help with routing the rest of their tribe. Go ahead and take the company of one of the Vengeful Protectors there and see to it that every last building is destroyed and every last troll killed. We can't have them coming back for revenge when we're less prepared, can we? 
Plant 8 Tree Seedlings in the Fertile Dirt Mounds.	Reclaiming Felfire Hill	Little one, to the southwest is an area of Nightsong Woods that has in recent times come to be called Felfire Hill. It is very sad to see the demons crawling over it, spreading their corruption. Would you do something to help take back the land? I have a number of seeds that I have been saving for such a purpose. Take them to Felfire Hill and plant them in the fertile dirt mounds. 
Collect Overlord Mok'Morokk's grog, snuff and strongbox from Dustwallow Marsh.	Overlord Mok'Morokk's Concern	Bow before Overlord Mok'Morokk! Rexxar make me mighty leader of Stonemaul Clan! Me good leader. Me keep clan safe. Big dragons come and make fire at old home. Me smart ogre. Find new home for clan here. Leave old home so fast, me forget stuff. Tiny Human, go get my things. Go south and find my yummy grog, my snuff and my strongbox. Me like you after you do that. You look in Den of Flame and Stonemaul Ruins... they be there, me sure! 
Kill Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion in Sable Ridge.	Fade to Black	Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master. I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion. If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos. 
Acquire King Reaperclaw's Horn.	It's Gotta be the Horn	The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands. I think all those smarts are hiding in their horns! If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make ""smart drinks."" I'll make a fortune! Here's where you come in: I want the horn from the smartest raptor around. ""King Reaperclaw"" leads a whole pack of intelligent raptors up on the bluffs north of Ratchet. Bring me his horn! And don't get ripped to ribbons like everyone else I've sent! 
Rescue Boog the ""Gear Whisperer"" and Minx from Painmaster Thundrak's Wagon of Unending Agony.	They Took Our Gnomes	The gnome explosives squad we requested from Tinker Town arrived last week. Just in time to face an assault by the Horde. We lost a lot of soldiers that day. Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, Silverwind Refuge has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes. I'm begging for your help here, George. Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes. 
Receive 6 Energized charges from the Energy Conduits as you ascend to the top of the Arcane Pinnacle.	Watch Your Step	This is somewhat simple and somewhat not simple. All the way up there are Energy Conduits. Rather like this one right here one might say! Indeed, I do say. Now for you. You must use my jump pads to ascend the pinnacle, and you must touch all of the conduits you see along the way. When you get to me at the top, you should be all juicy with energy, because really that's the only way to be. And be sure to keep moving or you're likely to be sent for quite a trip! 
Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay Razormaw.	Razormaw	Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death. Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form. 
Collect 5 Enervated Adders.	Adder Subtraction	The corruption unleashed here must be studied if we're to find a way of properly fighting it. Luckily, not all the creatures have been as altered as others. The smaller snakes drink little water, and do not eat plants, so their exposure to the energies here has been minimal. They've still absorbed enough to change coloration. Go collect these snakes from the overgrowth and return them to me, so we can see just what is happening to the creatures here. 
Kill 6 Windshear Overseers.	Windshear Mine Cleanup	The Horde has overrun Windshear Mine. I'm not sure what these orcs are hauling out of here or why they're here, but I know that it can't be good. Get in that mine and take out the management. Without goblin overseers, these peons will be even more worthless. While you're inside, keep your eyes peeled for any other information about the Horde operation in the mines. Good luck! 
Return to Aviana at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal.	Return to Aviana	George, you've done all you can here. This whole cavern is about to collapse in on itself! I'll gather up the last of our feathered steeds and ensure that the flamegate is sealed behind me. You should go on ahead and let Aviana know that this abominable hatchery is no more! 
Slap 7 Panicked Workers to make them cap the oil gushers.	Slap and Cap	Oh for... not again! If you heard the deputy yelling out there, that means we've got a fullblown oil leak on our hands! It's those filthy worgen again! Listen, it's going to be total chaos out there. Sleep-deprived goblins running around screaming and not knowing what to do. I need you to snap the workers back to their senses. A good, swift backhand across the face should do it! Once they shake themselves off, they'll get to work capping those gushers! 
Report to Blood Guard Aldo Rockrain at Silverwind Refuge in Ashenvale.	Warchief's Command: Stonetalon Mountains!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Blood Guard Aldo Rockrain at Silverwind Refuge in Ashenvale. The Horde forces in Stonetalon need your help to drive back the Alliance invaders and protect our people. The blood guard will direct you to the border of Stonetalon. To reach Silverwind Refuge, travel into the heart of Ashenvale and join our forces by the lake. Destiny calls! 
Destroy 8 Grave Guardians.	Stone Cold	Our assault on the Court of Bones continues. Our progress remains slow, but measurable. Unfortunately, we've received several reports of stone quilen statues coming to life without warning. These quilen are too dangerous to ignore. Venture into the Court of Bones and destroy any quilen statues that you can find. 
Weaken Impsy and use the Enchanted Imp Sack to capture him.	Do the Imp-Possible	The satyr hide their corrupted moonwell behind an impenetrable barrier of demonic fire. Their forces must have some way of getting through it. Interrogating the satyr will be useless, but the imps they consort with will be easily swayed. I have a specific one in mind, as well...In the foothills to the east, a lone imp has been seen wandering, far from the other demons. He should prove easy pickings. Weaken him with combat, and then use this enchanted sack to capture him. Then I'll do the talking... 
Speak to High Priest Amet inside the Vir'naal Dam in Uldum.	The High Priest's Vote	High Priest Amet's vote is the only one that is completely outside of our control. He will vote as his divinations tell him and nothing we do will dissuade him. I figure that gives us even odds either way. The only problem we face is that his clairvoyance has failed him ever since the barriers around Uldum fell. He will not cast a vote unless he regains power over his divinations. Take the stairs at either side of the Vir'naal Dam and Speak to him to see what you can do to help. 
Use the Initiation Podium at Doom's Vigil to successfully deliver the Graduation Speech.	Graduation Speech	You're finally ready, Georgedamus. I am so proud of you and all you've accomplished. Today you will deliver a speech in front of your peers and inspire them to crush our enemies until Hyjal is nothing but a pile of ash. Remember, Georgedamus. It'll be important to read your audience's emotions and use words that best address those emotions. 
Sneak into the Master's Glaive using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer.	Leave No Tracks	To the southwest lies the corpse of a being somehow related to the Old Gods that the Twilight's Hammer cultists worship. He was defeated before our time -- if not by the Titans themselves, certainly by one of their creations. We've noted an increase in cult activity in that area which can only mean something terrible is amiss. We're going to need to find out what they're planning to do there and why. Take this figurine, it'll help you avoid being detected while you gather intelligence. 
Speak with Assistant Greely to be shrunken down to rat-size. Mount a Rocketway Rat and use it to terrify Gormungan the giant.	Azsharite Experiment Number Two	Okay, new plan. We'll SCARE it out of 'em! In my experience most large creatures are terrified of tiny ones - like rats. Hmm. This place is crawling with rats, but how do we coax them over to the giant? Hey! You don't mind having your cellular matrix broken down and reassembled do you? It's only painful while it's happening. I can shrink you down to rat-sized and you can ride one of these brutes over there like a horse. It's so crazy it's got to work! Speak with me when you're ready for shrinkage... 
Speak with the Totem of Ruumbo near Deadwood Village.	A Talking Totem	The furbolg village to the south is the home of the Deadwood tribe, sworn enemies of the Timbermaw. They are corrupted and foul like so many others, driven mad by the taint of these woods. Something unusual has occured near the village though. Travelers coming here have said that the totem next to the road has spoken to them. I have heard nothing every time I approach it. Perhaps it will speak to you, George? Maybe you can find out what's going on for me. 
Bring 10 Black Dragonkin Essences to Brogg at Mudsprocket.	The Essence of Enmity	To make the totem Brogg will need for his ritual, he must use the essences of the creatures who killed his friends. The hate and anger of Brogg's enemies will fuel the magic of his vengeance. Track down Firemane ash tails, scouts, or scalebanes and use Brogg's totem on their corpses. Only when the dragonkin die will they give up their essences. The creatures you seek swarm over the Den of Flame to the northwest and the Stonemaul Ruins to the north. 
Defend the Mor'shan Caravan.	Mor'shan Caravan Delivery	You've managed to stir the Burning Blade's nest. Our scouts report that they are gathering for an attack. You must complete the caravan's journey before they arrive. The supplies are packed, the kodos are rested, and I hope you don't mind but I made a few adjustments to your gun. If you meet up with any resistance, shoot first and ask questions later. Quickly! They come! Speak to me when you are ready to leave. 
Disrupt Cho'Gall's Twilight Sermon.	Might of the Sentinels	The Twilight's Hammer? Here? This is far more serious than I expected. We've got to put a stop to this. I don't know if I'm ready to lead such an offensive, but I'm not about to let my fears get in the way of what needs to be done! I will rally our forces from Feathermoon Stronghold. Head to Dire Maul, make your way to the arena, and disrupt Cho'gall's activities; we will launch our attack during the confusion. 
You must gather 8 Melonfruit and squeeze their juices into the Cup of Elune at Sargeron.	Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix	The markings on the Sargeron ruins, combined with what you've gleaned from Furien's text make one thing clear:There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune. It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash. Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree.... 
Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 12 Silithid Eggs.	Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw?	The venomhide hatchling's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles. They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants. 
Bring Deadmire's Tooth to Melor in Thunder Bluff.	Deadmire	Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh. And it is his time to die. Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver. Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain. You must end the life of this noble creature, George. You must lead Deadmire to peace. 
Kill 6 Horde Enforcers and 6 Shatterspear Mystics.	Denying Manpower	To the north, the Shatterspear have a war camp where they are constructing their catapults. The camp is guarded by some of their mystics, but I've started receiving reports that there are sightings of orcs and tauren there as well. I don't want to make any assumptions as to what that suggests, but I do want you to go in and kill them before they can make any further strikes on our Sentinels. 
Slay 3 High Road Scouts.	Clear the High Road	This way, Mechanic! I see you've discovered the high road. The Alliance hopes to sever our ties with Stonetalon, but they forget that we tauren have hunted across these lands for generations. We know every hillside switchback and game trail from here to Thousand Needles. But for these paths to stay open, we must stop the humans from mapping them out. Patrol the trail east and kill any high road scouts you find along the way, then speak to Tunawa Stillwind just up the path. 
Use a squad of Maestra's Post Sentinels to destroy 3 Ashenvale Wreckers and slay 10 Horde Invaders.	A Squad of Your Own	I certainly hope that you're here to help, Mechanic. The situation is as dire as it appears. To put it quite simply, we are losing! My girls and I are the last line of defense against the Horde, but we're not going to get out of this one without taking the fight to them. Up for a challenge? I have a small squad of sentinels that I can loan to you. Get them close and I'm certain that their magic arrows can destroy those wreckers and invaders. Speak to me again if you need replacements. 
Use Dartol's Rod to be able to communicate with Krolg at Krolg's Hut in Ashenvale.	Dartol's Rod	I'm not completely certain what Teronis had in mind next, but if what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether, presumably that of a furbolg. Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to them, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was uncorrupted. I would start with one known as Krolg. Seek his hut southeast of Mystral Lake. 
Complete the Trial of Frost by gathering 20 Essence of Ice without getting hit by Frostburn.	The Trial of Frost	You know, some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted. I always say though, I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning. To reach the Trial of Frost, touch the Frost crystal to open a portal. Once there, the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies. To counter the simple, the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress, as it were. If you want to be fancy, you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by. Neat, eh? 
Slay Grolvitar the Everburning.	Fire in the Hole!	Land's sakes, pardner! You done shut off those valves but good. Unfortunately we've had a critical blowout in our gosh-darned central burnoff regulator! Missus Darla's done sent as many workers as she can rustle to go shut it off, but those flames have a mind of their own! Literally! They're hoppin' up and grabbin' anyone who comes near! So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya! 
Obtain the Essence of the Claw-Totem, the Essence of the Life-Totem, and the Essence of the Moon-Totem.	Magic Prehistoric	The owlbeasts' sacred caves are located to the east. Within several of these caves, you should find totems. I want you to approach these totems and gather whatever essence you can from them. The dreamcatcher should absorb this essence for use within Mazthoril. 
Bring the Captain's Documents to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.	The Theramore Docks	George, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks. They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea. One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize. He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you. The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks. Find those documents, George, and bring them to me. 
Start a bar fight!	Bar Fight!	Those no-good, smelly, green in the gills goblins have got it coming! I want you to go into the Speedbarge Bar, order a bottle of grog, and hit one over the head with it! Show them that we're not going to take any more of their insolence, George! 
Truun wants you to ride Brutusk to the Warsong Labor Camp. Speak with Kadrak to get Kadrak's Reins to ride Brutus.	Got Lumber?	Kadrak has just received fresh orders for our troops. I hear we're to begin offensive strikes into Ashenvale! I have far too few supplies to support an assault, and my shipment from Orgrimmar has yet to arrive. I am forced to improvise, and could use your help, Mechanic. Speak with Kadrak and ask him for the reins to Brutusk. The kodo will take you to the Warsong Labor Camp. Once there, seek out Gorka and ask her to load you up with logs. 
Collect 6 Rope Pieces.	Be Prepared	Every adventurer worth their salt knows never to step foot in a cave, dungeon, crypt or tomb without an ample supply of rope... right? You can never have too much of this stuff! You resolve to scrounging every scrap of it you can find from the skeletons here. 
	Silithyst	 
Collect 10 Marsh Frog Legs from Giant Marsh Frogs.	Marsh Frog Legs	I like cooking. Good swamp cooking. Fried green frog legs and the like. And I'm all out of legs. The manor is overrun with frogs, though. Giant marsh frogs. Think you could bring me some of those legs? Nothin' to it, really. Just bop 'em on the head and bring me the legs. Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too. Do you like stew? 
Complete the Trial of Fire by standing in the fire runes without getting hit by flame for 10 consecutive bursts.	The Trial of Fire	The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens. To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win! There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do. 
Extinguish a Harpy Signal Fire to get the attention of Marion Wormwing. Fight her until Thisalee subdues her, then question the harpy matron.	A Bird in Hand	It's time to get to the bottom of this. We need to interrogate the matron of these beasts, Marion Wormwing. We'll capture her alive. Here's the plan:The harpies communicate across the ridge using a series of signal fires. If we extinguish one, Marion is sure to come investigate. You fight her as a distraction while I sneak up behind and grab her. I'll leave the questioning to you. Let's get her, George! 
Obtain the Rusted Cage Key.	Two-Tusk Takedown	This treasure's all fake, but it's not like those den whompers are going to know the difference. Stupid ogres! Here's the plan... you head into the Admiral's Den and spread all of this ""treasure"" around to any ogres that get in your way. Then all you have to do is confront Tony Two-Tusk. You'll have the key to the cage in no-time! 
Rescue Tahet at the Pit of Scales in Uldum.	The Pit of Scales	A spot on the southern end of the map was marked with hieroglyphs of crocodiles fighting each other. That must be where Caimas took Tahet. Go to the Pit of Scales and find a way to rescue the Vizier's son. 
Speak with Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck.	The Zeppelin Crash	Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago. She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and its pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried. If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains. 
Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 2 Ysera's Tears.	Ysera's Tears	Good to see you again, George! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another? To the northeast lies Wyrmscar Island, home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully. 
Collect 6 Blood Shard Trinkets from Razormane Quilboar.	Blood of the Barrens	This bright red stone, found clutched in the grasp of a quilboar, has been carefully carved into the likeness of a great boar, with thorny vines sprouting from its back. Its surface is smooth and worn with care. Did the quilboar make this? If you find others, maybe one of the shaman at Firestone Point could tell you more about them. 
Obtain a Tough Yeti Hide from any Ice Thistle Yeti and 5 Wildkin feathers. Combine them to make a Winterspring Cat Toy and use it to play with your Winterspring Cub.	Cub's First Toy	The winterspring cub plays with a small tuft of fur from a large animal, batting the discarded hair about. While your cub looks like it's enjoying the new game, you wonder if it might get more enjoyment from a proper cat toy. With a little bit of leather from a yeti pelt and some feathers from crazed moonkin, you could make a respectable toy. You'll need a hide from the yeti in the Ice Thistle Hills southeast of Everlook and feathers from the moonkin at the Hidden Grove or Owl Wing Thicket. 
Deliver the Glyphed Crystal Prism to Geologist Larksbane at the Cenarion Hold in Silithus.	Unraveling the Mystery	We're on the verge of a breakthrough, George! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid. Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals. Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold. She might be able to help. 
Meet with Kalec in Bilgewater Harbor.	Azshara Blues	Hey! I'm glad I caught you. I come on behalf of my master, Kalec. He requires your aid. Find him under the bridge in the slums as soon as you can! 
Use Thonk's Spyglass to search for survivors in Southfury Watershed.	Lost in the Floods	The recent cataclysmic events have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, Mechanic. The Southfury River has overflowed, and Durotar's entire western basin is now flooded. There are still people out there. I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything. Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself? 
Kill Wyneth in order to lure out Verog the Dervish, then slay him and grab his head.	Verog the Dervish	Verog may be hard to find, but judging by the info you gathered, his mate Wyneth is always in his command tent just west of here. If we kill her, Verog will come running. Regthar sent us here to scout, but he also said we should seize any opportunity to upset the centaur chain of command if we can. Lure out Verog and kill him! 
Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces.	Continued Incubation	The egg is doing well, but we're going to need more of those void crystals to keep it healthy. Could you go out and gather some? 
Defeat Lord Ginormus.	Thunderdrome: The Ginormus!	The rules are simple: Two men enter, one--wait. Sometimes there's women. Two people enter, one--Wait, no, sometimes it's more than two...and that means more than two come out--Alright, only rule is stay in the drome! There are no other rules! You're up against the biggest, baddest member of the Wastewander Bandits first. This'll either be a warmup or a bloodbath...it's up to you which! 
Speak with Jaina to travel to Stormwind and meet with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth.	Proof of Treachery	Although Onyxia has been exposed and removed from the court, the Defias who carried out her plan must be punished. Carry word to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in Stormwind castle that the Defias are the ones who carried out the Varian's kidnapping. I have little doubt that Stormwind's armies will mete out swift and terrible justice to those involved. I can use my magic to expedite your trip to Stormwind. Just speak to me when you're prepared to go, George. 
Slay Forgemaster Pyrendius. Lure him onto the Portal Runes and use them to weaken him.	Forgemaster Pyrendius	A terrible evil squats in the heart of this cavern, George. Forgemaster Pyrendius has personally crafted many of the cursed weapons that Twilight's Hammer is using in their conquest of the realms above. Before we leave these lands of flame... Pyrendius must die. He will not go down easy. But, if I'm reading the tome correctly, we can briefly open up small gateways to the Abyssal Maw, the realm of water. Lure Pyrendius onto a portal rune and activate it to weaken him! 
Search the Southfury Watershed and help the people you saw in the spyglass.	Watershed Patrol	My post is here on the tower, George, and I cannot leave it. I need someone to go out there and help the people who are still trapped in the river's overflow. Can I count on you? 
Stop the Neferset Ritual at the Murkdeep Cavern.	The Defilers' Ritual	Ah, I can already see more clearly, George. We are right to be wary of the evil Neferset. I can already sense that they're behind the forces that corrupt the river. Go underwater once more and find the Murkdeep Cavern. You will find the Neferset are performing a foul ritual of corruption. Stop them so the river is cleansed once again. 
Channel the Flameseer's Staff to weaken Baron Geddon.	The Return of Baron Geddon	Ragnaros is not the only powerful elemental that has re-emerged into our world. The dreaded Baron Geddon is leading the onslaught and we must put an end to this rampage. The Flameseer's Staff has proven powerful. Perhaps it is powerful enough to weaken him to the point where our arch druids can bind him where he stands. Go, George and be careful. Baron Geddon is a vengeful and treacherous being. 
Bring the Voidtouched Egg to H'partho Adoros in Ramkahen.	The Incredible Egg	<The aqir seem to have been in the process of empowering this egg with void magic. It looks to be far from hatching, so it should be safe to study to find out what they were planning to do with it. Someone in the Explorer's League might be interested in taking a look.> 
Slay Barak Kodobane and collect his head.	Kolkar Leaders	The centaurs have plagued the tauren for years. And recently, the Kolkar centaurs of the Barrens have grown into a real threat. Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them. Rallying them. To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed. Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane. He camps west of these Forgotten Pools. Defeat him, then return to me. 
Obtain 80 Pristine Thunderhead Feathers from the Hippogryphs near the Ruins of Nordressa.	Shear Will	I'd be amazing! At archmagery. Amazing! He won't even talk to me because I don't have a stupid robe and hat. Pffft. The most amazing archmage this land has ever seen can't just have any robe and hat. I need to show him that I'm something special, and I know just how to do it. Go out there and kill some of those hippogryph things. Bring me back a TON of feathers. You heard me! A whole bunch of feathers! Go go, I'll have the robe ready for them by the time you get back. 
Collect 10 Blood-filled Leeches.	Blood Theory	The land is not all that has changed in Desolace. Here, the wildlife has responded to their new environment in strange and sometimes exciting ways. I am particularly interested in the Rejuvenated Thunder Lizards that roam just to the west. I need a sample of their blood. You may begin helping me by using this jar of leeches on a few of them. Once they've filled on the blood of those beasts, return them to me. 
Get the Rusted Skull Key from Gar'gol's Personal Treasure Chest.	Gar'gol's Gotta Go	<Kristoff cranes his neck, trying to look you in the eye.>Listen, you gotta get me outta here. They're either going to eat me or turn me over to the Twilight's Hammer. Maybe both. They've padlocked me in, and Gar'gol keeps the key in his personal treasure chest. Kill Gar'gol if you have to - but get that key!<Kristoff flails his limbs, helplessly.> 
Locate Choluna at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal.	Wings Over Mount Hyjal	George, is it true you're going to try to commune with the ancients? Southwest of here is the Shrine of Aviana, the matron of all flying creatures. It's the home of my favorite instructor, Choluna. I've never encountered one who was so deeply in touch with the spirits of this world. You could learn a lot from her! The recent attacks have isolated the shrine. But it's easily accessible from the air - look for the second biggest tree on Hyjal. Good luck! 
Slay 15 Winterfall furbolg of any kind near the Frostfire Hot Springs.	Threat of the Winterfall	I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have... strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg. They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here. I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me? 
Attach a Mageweave Tether to 8 Drowned Thunder Lizards in Thunder Ridge.	Thunder Down Under	Our army needs water, and luckily the elements gave us plenty of that when the cataclysm hit. The water that filled up the canyon to the southwest should do the trick. Unfortunately, the corpses of thunder lizards still sit at the bottom of the canyon, and their electrical discharges are a bit too dangerous. I've got grunts that can lift them out of the water, but we need someone agile enough to attach the other end of the rope. Are you my <man/woman>, George? 
Defeat Mok'Morokk and report the news to Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village.	Challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk	You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk? Haw! Me crush tiny Human! You tell me when ready for good beating. 
Escort the confused Prospector Remtravel to his missing journal. Talk to Jr. Archaeologist Ferd at the dig site when you're done.	The Absent-Minded Prospector	Who are you again? George? Have we met? If you're here from the League, you can tell them I'm not leaving! Not without my find. I had it, right in my hands! Then the screaming. Then the wetness. Listen here whos-yer-name, I documented the whole thing in my journal the day the tidal wave hit. And I know just where I left it! The journal. Not the find. Help me get the one so we can get the other! Or vice-versa! Do you follow? Follow me! 
Use Darla's Grapple to collect Irontree Oil Cans and use them to oil 7 Irontree Shredders.	It's Time to Oil Up	Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can. I've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance. Use this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you? 
Gather 6 Searing Collars from the cultists in Skull Rock.	Skull Rock	George. The Burning Blade has infested the cave east of Orgrimmar known as Skull Rock. Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars. By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power. But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study. Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there. Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets. 
Disrupt Cho'Gall's Twilight Sermon.	Might of the Stonemaul	So the Twilight's Hammer thinks it can just raise its own army of ogres here? In the middle of Horde territory? We'll see about that. Ogres only respect one thing: strength. I want you to lead the assault on Cho'gall's sermon, George. Throw wide the doors of Dire Maul, leap into the arena, and cut down his attendants. 
Destroy 5 of Seldarria's Eggs.	Brood of Seldarria	<The Gnomecorder buzzes.>Be very careful, George. You do not want to rouse that black dragon. Now, look around you. If this is a nest then there must be black dragon eggs nearby. Search the premises for eggs and destroy any that you see. Return to me should you find and destroy Seldarria's eggs. Goldrinn watch over you. 
Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Spies.	Blood Watch	Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the Exodar survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find. 
Learn what it means to be Horde.	To Be Horde...	Stand by me, George, and watch as our mighty weapon destroys our enemies! Learn what it means to be Horde! 
Borrow a wind rider from Dyslix Silvergrub and speak with Kanati Greycloud at Westreach Summit in Thousand Needles.	To the Summit	We are staging a relief effort at Westreach Summit for all of Thousand Needles. The goblin, Dyslix Silvergrub, will lend you my wind rider to safely get you there. Speak with Kanati Greycloud when you land. You must go quickly if lives are to be saved! 
Report to Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village.	Sen'jin Village	You've be doin' quite well for one so young. I've no doubts you'll be makin' quite da name for yarself. Go now, northwest, across da shallows ta Sen'jin Village. Dere you'll be meetin' Master Gadrin. He'll likely have a task or two for ya before ya truly make ya way out into the Durotar wilds. Please remember, George, we may disagree wit' the young Hellscream at times, but his intentions are noble, and it be very important that we remain united as one Horde. Make da Darkspear proud. 
Speak to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse on the island east of Theramore.	This Old Lighthouse	The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again. I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know? 
Report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale.	To the Mor'shan Rampart	Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart to the north is calling for aid. The rampart rests on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. It is the front line in the fight against the Alliance. We're driving the night elves out of the forest. We'll claim its resources for the Horde! To get there, take the Gold Road north out of the Crossroads. Destiny calls! 
Find and defeat the Winterfall Runner and take the Winterfall Crate from him.	Winterfall Runners	Very interesting, George...When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater. We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment. 
Obtain the Chalice of Elune.	The Lost Chalice	The area to our west, now called Satyrnaar, was once a prominent shrine built by my people. It housed a priceless relic, the Chalice of Elune, entrusted to the shrine's keepers by the priests of Elune. Pilgrims once traveled to the shrine to experience the healing powers the chalice was rumored to hold. These stories might be nothing but old wives' tales, but if there is any truth to them, the relic may hold the key to rejuvenating the wounded forest. I must know, George. 
Free Prince Nadun and speak to King Phaoris at Ramkahen in Uldum.	Escape From the Lost City	Everything is ready! Undo my chains and set your friends free. We must move quickly before the Neferset scum realize we're up to something! If we make it, see my brother, King Phaoris for a reward. 
You are to return to Cenarion Researcher Korrah at Ethel Rethor.	Return and Report	It is done! Together we were able to bring down a dangerous adversary. Neptulon himself shall hear of your exploits here, Mechanic. Allow me to extend you his thanks...You should leave now. This place will not remain safe for long. Soon, the naga will seek vengeance for their priestess. 
Speak to Sergeant Dontrag inside the Deep Reaches in Stonetalon Mountains.	Where Are the Parts?	I've been waiting on parts for these guns for days! I sent one of my best blastgineers and two dozen miners into the Deep Reaches five days ago for the parts. After not hearing from anybody for three days I began to get a little worried. The Overlord sent two of his best orcs in to see what was going on. We've received no reports since then...Head into the Deep Reaches, directly below this fortress, and find out what's going on! I need parts! 
Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.	The Befouled Element	The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water. The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting. It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe. It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea. 
Bring 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.	Secret Communication	Some of the Twilight's Hammer cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them. I want you to bring me a stack of them, Mechanic. I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point! These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly. The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate! 
Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in the Northern Barrens.	Warchief's Command: Northern Barrens!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post in the Northern Barrens. Your help is needed to secure the Northern Barrens against the encroaching quilboars and centaurs. To reach Far Watch Post, travel west across Durotar's Southfury Watershed and cross the bridge into the Northern Barrens. Destiny calls! 
Obtain an Enormous Dinosaur Talon.	The Fossil-Finder 3000	One of the things I hate the most about digging is the fact that half the time, all you find is dirt. That's why I've been spending most of my time out here tinkering instead of digging. Let me show you what I've invented: the Fossil-Finder 3000. I just put the finishing touches on it. If it works properly, it should find the largest fossils in the area. I know, sweet, huh? Test it out and see if you can find some ridiculously big dinosaur bones. 
Using the contents of Torwa's Pouch, summon Lar'korwi and defeat him. Then bring Lar'korwi's Head to Torwa Pathfinder near the entrance to Un'Goro Crater.	The Bait for Lar'korwi	This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will. 
Use Buried Artifact Detector on the beach near Remtravel's Excavation site to locate 5 Ancient Device Fragments. Combine them to create the Ancient Slotted Device.	The Titans' Terminal	Now that we have the disc, a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, Prospector Remtravel unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster. It's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck! It can't have gone far, George. Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them. 
Take the Tear of Elune and cleanse it in the waters of the Moonwell of Purity in Ashenvale.	A Trip to the Moonwell	It didn't work.<A sorrowful and resigned expression upon his face, Pelturas removes the tear from the soup and gently washes it.>The eruption of Thunder Peak must have affected it in some way. You must take the tear to the Moonwell of Purity, which still lies intact, protected by the goddess' power, at the southeast base of the volcano. There, you will wash it in the sacred waters of Elune. What happens beyond that, I cannot say. I fear for my daughter's life. It is in your hands now, George. 
Speak with 8 Twilight Servitors to administer the draught and rescue them.	Free Your Mind, the Rest Follows	<Rio said that the draught would not remain effective for long.><You'd better hurry into the hovel and administer it to as many Twilight Servitors as you can find.> 
Collect 4 Grimtotem Notes from Grimtotem Elders and combine them to form the full Grimtotem Battle Plan.	The Grimtotem Plot	With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion. We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target. Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans. 
Get and equip a Twilight Firelance using the rack behind Farden. Mount one of Aviana's Guardians and fly her to the Guardian Flag on the ledge below. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!	Flight in the Firelands	George, our enemy is using this grotto in the Firelands to prepare an invasion. We're going to hit them hard right where they live. But first, you'll need to get your wings. Flight in the Firelands does not work as it does in the outside world. Something about the dense, superheated air. You'll need some practice! Get a Twilight Firelance from the rack behind me, equip it, then mount one of Aviana's Guardians. Practice flying - flap your wings! Visit a flag placed on the ledge below and return. 
Report to Force Commander Valen at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains.	Dances with Grimtotem	Return now to your leader and tell him all that you have done for the Grimtotem. Tell him that the Alliance may pass freely across our borders. 
Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your Aqir Hatchling and battle enemies in Uldum or Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Fighting tougher and rarer enemies will help your hatchling grow faster.	Aqir Instincts	In observing the aqir battling the Wastewanders, I have seen the newly hatched immediately join the aqiri assault. It would seem the need for combat is born into these creatures. We should exercise this in our new hatchling, under your supervision of course. Take him out with you and show him how to fight our enemies. He may not be able to fight for long, so don't call him until you're ready for training. With luck, he will come to see us as part of his hive. 
Kill 100 Schnottz Troopers while mounted on the Confiscated Artillery.	Fire From the Sky	Sullah wasn't kidding. That hill is crawling with troopers! Jump on and paint our targets for me. Make every shot count, George! We need to be able to get up there. 
Use the Bottled Bileberry Brew on the corpse of a Twilight Inferno Lord, then speak with him.	A New Master	The potion you created is vile enough to wake the dead. Which is its intended purpose. Slay a Twilight Inferno Lord and force the brew down his throat. He will revive, if only briefly, and be completely under your dominance. Speak with him and learn the true name of the fire elemental he is channeling into the world to burn down your precious forest. 
Ride Thessera to defeat 12 Twilight Riders and destroy the Twilight Portal.	The Eye of All Storms	Twilight riders circle the skies above the vortex. I fear it is their magic that has kept the cataclysmic forces from being contained by our efforts. Take to the skies with Thessera and destroy the riders and the portal from whence they came. 
Retrieve the head of Lord Melenas.	Twisted Hatred	I must warn you, George, this matter must stay between us. The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home. He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of Fel Rock, to the north, where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul. You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head. 
Bring the Hellscream's Missive to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel.	Disturbing Connections	The letter from Garrosh Hellscream makes clear the suspicions that were raised during the offensive on the Shatterspear. The presence of forsaken at the tower ruins and horde supplies and enforcers at the Shatterspear War Camp were only the start. Garrosh himself contacted the Shatterspear to spur their offensive towards Lor'danel, and it seems clear that he fully intends to push from the south as well. Glynda Nal'Shea will need this information if the night elves are to be prepared. 
Speak to Oomla Whitehorn at Wolf's Run in Hyjal.	The Return of the Ancients	It'll be crucial to reclaim each of the ancients' shrines, George. Follow the road west of the Verdant Thicket, into Wolf's Run. We have operatives stationed there. Aid them in any way that you can and work your way to the first shrine. The wolf god was known to the elves as Goldrinn and to the orcs as Lo'Gosh. He will be a fierce ally in our fight against the enemy. 
Kessel at Kessel's Crossing wants you to warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing of the imminent blood elf invasion. Return to Kessel when you complete this task. You have 15 minutes. (Be sure to keep it out of water.)	The Kessel Run	You're just in time, George. Blood elf activity in this area has doubled in the past week. Our agents have informed us that the blood elves that call themselves Sunhawks plan to launch an offensive upon Azuremyst soon. I need you to get a warning out to our allies and compatriots. Warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing. Time is of the essence so I am lending you my elekk. Be sure to keep it out of water. 
Find someone who knows of Ghost Howl.	The Demon Scarred Cloak	The ragged hide of Ghost Howl still bears a terrible wound, gained from the wolf's battles against the Burning Legion. Perhaps someone in Camp Sungraze should know of Ghost Howl's demise.... 
Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact.	The Secrets of Uldum	We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, George. This is a momentous occasion. From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to Uldum itself. The quakes that ripped its doors open have probably collapsed the tunnels, but we may yet find amazing things hidden within. Search the ruins for anything intact that may be studied. The thrill of discovery awaits! 
Confront 5 Deserter Agitators in Theramore.	Traitors Among Us	It's good to meet you, Mechanic. I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town. These deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks. They're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them. 
Attack one of the Runaway Shredders near the rear gates of Orgrimmar and hop inside once it's been significantly damaged.	Runaway Shredder!	I've been trying to impress our new Horde allies with our legendary goblin efficiency, but in hindsight automating the shredders was a bad idea. Now they're mindless killing machines, rampaging over the countryside. Don't get me wrong - that kind of thing has its place - but for the time being I need a brave Mechanic to help me get these things under control. It's easy. Automated shredders, like all machines, must first be beaten into submission. Afterwards, seize the controls and I'll radio you instructions. 
Obtain 6 samples of Scorpid Venom by placing the Poison Extraction Totem near a Clattering Scorpid.	Never Trust a Big Barb and a Smile	Next, we gonna get some poison from the scorpions that be runnin' around here. But don't you worry, Bom'bay's not gonna let you get hurt! Bom'bay's got a big totem that you gonna stick in the ground when the scorpion strikes. The totem gonna suck up all the poison, and you gonna walk away still breathing. Sound good? 
Report to Nyse at Mudsprocket in southern Dustwallow Marsh. Optionally, grab a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Thousand Needles!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Nyse at Mudsprocket. Join the Horde forces fighting against the renegade Grimtotems who dominate the area. Nyse will provide you with transportation to the front lines. She will be waiting for you at Mudsprocket's inn, tucked away in southern Dustwallow Marsh. Destiny calls! 
Slay Moora and Salia.	Twin Temptresses	Moora and Salia are the personal servants of Shadow Lord Fel'dan. Do not be deceived by them! These foul succubi use their wiles and foul magic to draw mortals deep into Shadow Hold. Those in their grasp undergo brainwashing, or are sacrificed by Fel'dan to his demonic masters. The two fight as one and are never found apart, making them a considerable threat. Proceed further into Shadow Hold and slay them. 
Slay 8 Irontree Choppers.	Enemy at our Roots	The goblins are already upon us! We have tried everything in our power to warn the goblins to leave Irontree Clearing before we resorted to violence. As they turned a blind ear to us, we struck, and now rather than spare the forest they would lay down their lives for greed. They will soon know the full extent of our fury! The battle rages just beyond our northern gate. Join our pack in glory and slay any goblin who dares come before us! 
	Azeroth's Tear	 
Huntress Kima at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to recover 20 Telaar Supply Crates.	The Ravaged Caravan	I was part of a caravan taking supplies to the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh. As we were nearing the border of the marsh, we were jumped by a vicious squad of Warmaul ogres. They killed the others and took me prisoner, along with all of our supplies. Thankfully, they neglected to place a backing on my cage. When they fell asleep, I made my escape. It's too late for my comrades but we could really use the supplies they stole. Warmaul Hill is in the northwestern mountains of Nagrand. 
Deliver the Instant Ice Block to Seril Scourgebane in Everlook.	Ice Delivery	Alright, one high-quality, pure grade Instant Ice Block! I tried selling these to people for protection for a while. Y'know, like that trick you see mages pull? Couldn't figure out the whole ""breathing"" thing, though. 
Deliver the I-Scream Cryocannon to Brivelthwerp at the Sunken Dig Site in Thousand Needles.	Special Delivery for Brivelthwerp	I have a new business partner, my best buddy, Brivelthwerp. Even as we speak, he's building up the infrastructure for our new ice cream empire! He took our coolant tug, inventory, and employees southwest to the Sunken Dig Site. Unfortunately, I don't currently have a way to deliver something to him... something extremely important: our super-secret I-Scream Cryocannon! You don't mind taking it to him, do you, George? 
Kill Ursal the Mauler.	Ursal the Mauler	Now the time has come to save the Druids of the Talon. If we fail now, George, they will be forever lost in sleep. I shall prepare the Relics of Wakening and perform the ritual. For my work to take effect, the cursed beast responsible for this horrible situation must be slain. It was Ursal the Mauler who meddled with our brethren's calling and it is Ursal the Mauler who must now pay so they can be freed. Travel northwest on the road and find the path north into The Cleft. Ursal's den will be there. 
Take the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon to the Sludgewerks in Stonetalon Mountains.	Beginning of the End	Champion, we have acquired a new target. Our scouts in Battlescar Valley report that the night elves are preparing their own weapon of mass destruction and hiding it within an ancient tree. They will never be given the chance to use their weapon against us. You are to escort the bomb to the Sludgewerks for refueling and then to Cliffwalker Post, from which we will detonate the bomb and kill all of our enemies. Go now, George. Report to Jibbly Rakit when you arrive at the Sludgewerks. 
Complete the Trial of Shadow by luring 20 Weeping Souls into the shadow runes without getting touched.	The Trial of Shadow	Let us not be confined by the bounds of the mage repertoire of magic. I, for one, choose not to be classist. Necromancy can just be so much fun! Touch the Shadow Crystal to open a portal to my Trial of Shadow. Once there, move to the Altar when you are ready to begin. Weeping Souls shall begin to pursue you... your goal is simply to drag them into the traps. And be sure not to let them touch you. 
Speak with Tyrus Blackhorn and convince him to help in the fight against the Twilight's Hammer.	If You're Not Against Us...	South of here you'll find a solitary tower, known as ""Blackhorn's Penance."" Upon it is bound a demon: Tyrus Blackhorn. You may think me mad for turning to an old foe for help, but Blackhorn was once a mortal, and I can't imagine he wants to watch Twilight's Hammer triumph. Speak with Blackhorn, and see if you can convince him to help us in our fight. He may yet redeem himself....Just don't set him free! 
Step through the Nightmare Portal in the Earthshatter Cavern and speak to Thessera.	The Emerald Dream	Our efforts in containing the destruction don't appear to be quite enough. I fear we're going to need aid from beyond the waking world. Twilight cultists inside the Earthshatter Cavern to the east have opened a gateway to a nightmare-infested section of the Emerald Dream. They hold a green dragon prisoner named Thessera there. Go through the nightmare portal and free her. She will be a powerful ally. 
Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to locate the Sun Portal Site and slay 5 Void Anomalies.	I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness	Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened. You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies. Be warned, George; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself. Should you find void anomalies, slay them! Report back to me with any new information that you may find. Begin your search to the north, near the Warp Piston. 
Bring the head of Cap'n Garvey to Gazlowe in Ratchet.	WANTED: Cap'n Garvey	WANTED! ""Cap'n"" J. Garvey of the Maiden's DaggerCharged with piracy on the open seas, kidnapping, extortion, arson, slavery, et al. Garvey recently arrived in these waters leading a crew of Southsea Freebooters and was last seen assaulting Fray Island. Bring proof of death in an identifiable condition!-- Gazlowe 
Attack 3 Wayward Plainstriders until they flee toward the Barrens.	Unbidden Visitors	Don' worry, Zen'Taji's not in any trouble. He just been studyin' what happens when the river overflows. Ya see the big tall birds that stand on the riverbank? Zen'Taji thinks they're in trouble. The earthquake and the flood pushed the plainstriders over to this side of the water, but they can't fly back, and they're too scared to swim. They'll die if they stay here. Zen'Taji doesn't like violence, but maybe YOU can attack them and scare them over to the other side. Yes? 
Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to destroy the Statue of Queen Azshara and kill Atoph the Bloodcursed.	Ending the Bloodcurse	To the south you will find Bloodcurse Isle. Atop the island you will find a shrine dedicated to the beloved queen of the naga, Azshara. Destroy the statue - burn it in effigy! This will surely draw the ire of Atoph, the Bloodcursed leader. Slay Atoph and return to me! 
Get a River Boat from Mazzer Stripscrew and then use the Frost Cannon to extinguish 15 fires.	Pirate Accuracy Increasing	I don't know if you've noticed, but the cannonballs are hitting us. I'd say the Southsea pirates are getting more accurate... the ship is on fire! You've got a river boat now. Go talk to Mazzer Stripscrew. Put those fires out! 
Deliver the SI:7 Emblem to High Overlord Saurfang at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	Message for Saurfang	<The Darkspear loyalist opens the package and reads the letter within. As she finishes the note from Thrall, a hint of a fanged smile appears on her face.>Ya should take dis directly to Saurfang inside Orgrimmar. Be sure ta let him know dat de package be from Thrall. Take me raptor. Hurry, little one, dere be no time ta waste! 
Speak to General Nazgrim on Hellscream's Fist.	Into the Mists	<Nazgrim fills his lungs with sea air.>You smell that, George? It's the smell of our home, the lands our kind have bled and died to preserve. And listen... you hear that? It's the sound of peace and safety - a haven we've carved, where our enemies fear to tread. Remember these things. You won't experience them again anytime soon. We have ourselves a war to win. Now go get settled, we're shovin' off! 
Fill the Tourmaline Phial.	Teldrassil: The Coming Dawn	There is one last moonwell that I would like you to visit. It is directly south of here, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand. I sense a growing corruption from the boughs of southern Teldrassil. When you have the water, I want you to bring it to a familiar face that you'll see at the pools. She wishes to battle the corruption, and has asked for you personally. 
Take a flight to Irontree Clearing and speak with Darla Drilldozer.	Back to Business	All this happy friends stuff is great, isn't it? People working together, healing the forest. But what's gonna happen to the forest when it's healed? It's just gonna sit there? We need this lumber. The Horde needs it. I've got orders here to send as many loyal Horde soldiers--and I'm sure you're loyal--up north to Irontree Clearing. I've already arranged for the hippogryph master to give you a free ride over there. Talk to Darla Drilldozer when you touch down. 
Use the Geologist's Transcription Kit to make a Hive'Regal Rubbing from the Hive'Regal Glyphed Crystal.	Glyph Chasing	After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals. If I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness. Take this transcription set and hit Hive'Regal to the east, George. That's the last rubbing I need! 
Jinx at The Skunkworks wants you to kill 12 Ashenvale Assassins.	They're Out There!	They're out there, Mechanic. And they're on to us. Some of my men have begun turning up dead. Elf attacks, no question about it. My guess is that your work at Astranaar has them desperate to stop our progress here. A last ditch effort to escape defeat! Take these goggles. They'll help you see even the sneakiest of the elves. Keep them off my back while we finish weaponizing your explosives. 
Obtain a Pirate's Crowbar and use it to pry open the Submerged Outhouse door.	In the Outhouse	Hello? Hello! HELP! I'm almost out of air! You have to get me out of here!<The voice inside gags.>One of those filthy Southsea treasure hunters has got to have a crowbar! 
Disarm the First, Second and Third Bomb Clusters and deactivate 4 Unstable Bomb Bots at the Tomb of the Sun King.	A Disarming Distraction	The curse has taken over the expedition members' higher brain functions, but my calculations reveal their suppressed adolescent subconscious can still be stimulated by realistic imagery. Utilize this holo-projector to distract them. They are currently setting up explosives at the tomb to the east to attempt to gain access to secret passages in Uldum. They seek dangerous re-origination technology beneath Uldum and must be stopped. 
Kill 30 Unbound Flame Spirits.	Flamebreaker	The large elementals that besiege us are not a singular entity. They are an amalgamation of lesser spirits bound together by the Twilight's Hammer cultists' magic. The rebuilt flameseer's staff will give us enough power to shatter its bonds. Destroy the smaller elementals once you've broken up the more dangerous large ones. 
Ahab Wheathoof at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore wants you to feed his prized puppy, Kyle the Frenzied. Feed Kyle Tender Strider Meat and return to Ahab Wheathoof.	Kyle's Gone Missing!	Help, George! My prized puppy, Kyle, has run away! I just know he's running around Bloodhoof Village, lost and hungry. Will you find him and feed him? Once he eats he will settle down and come home. To feed him you will need to find food. His favorite meal is tender strider meat. Just venture east and you should find plenty of striders. Hunt one down and take its succulent meat to Kyle. When you see Kyle in town, put the meat down and he is sure to come to you. 
Use the Pirate Signal to summon Tony Two-Tusk and his crew to the Maiden's Dagger. Help him to defeat Alicia Cuthbert below decks.	Mutiny, Mon!	Now for my favorite part of any mutiny: the killin'! For pirates, it doesn't matter who's supposed to be in charge, only who's in control of the ships. Anchored on the east end of this island is the Maiden's Dagger, Cap'n Garvey's old flagship. He left his most trusted officer in charge: Alicia Cuthbert. Once we take her out, the ship is ours, and so's the sea. I'll get the men onto the boats. I need you to board the Dagger and blow this horn from on deck - that'll be our signal to board. Yar! 
Defeat Gavis Greyshield aboard the ship southeast of Theramore.	The End of the Deserters	Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks. Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win. 
Slay Shadow Lord Fel'dan.	Shadow Lord Fel'dan	Shadow Lord Fel'dan awaits further in the depths, George. His wrath will be unmatched now that you have slain his beloved pets. Even without Moora and Salia at his side, he is a terrible force to be reckoned with. Beware his dark powers; he is nearly more demon than orc by now. 
Report to Witch Doctor Jin'Zil at Malaka'jin in Stonetalon Mountains.	Eyes and Ears: Malaka'jin	Honor's Stand has been lost. The Horde's grip on the Barrens shattered along with the land itself. I now receive reports that we are at risk of losing Malaka'jin to a concerted attack by the Alliance and the Grimtotem. If Malaka'jin falls, half of Stonetalon falls with it! You have proven yourself a capable soldier of the Horde. Will you be my eyes and ears at Malaka'jin? Witch Doctor Jin'Zil awaits your arrival. Malaka'jin is located far to the south. 
Bring the three chapters of the Twilight Lexicon to Hermit Ortell in Silithus.	The Twilight Lexicon	The Twilight's Hammer are not kind to those that leave their ranks. They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast! Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine! To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon. It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations! The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as Twilight Keepers. Look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps. 
Speak with Pao'ka Swiftmountain at Highperch in Thousand Needles.	Trouble at Highperch	Thank you for your help, George. You should speak with Pao'ka Swiftmountain at Highperch to the southwest. Perhaps he will know the whereabouts of the Elder Crone? 
Speak with Bolyun at Bolyun's Camp in Ashenvale.	Three Friends of the Forest	Care to make a quick trip to the south? I've three friends that I haven't heard from in a while. With these strange tentacles popping out of the ground to the north, and all of the demonic activity, I don't dare leave my family. Bolyun set up his camp in the southwest corner of the forest, just to the northwest of that damnable Fire Scar Shrine. Alenndaar and Harlown joined him, so they should all be okay, but you never know. Thanks, George. 
Defeat the Titanic Guardian.	I'll Do It By Hand	Yes, this all looks familiar enough. Thanks to all the information you gathered for me, I'm sure that I can activate the mechanism. I'll just need some time free from distraction. As soon as I get started, you can count on that titan construct to try and stop me. That's where you come in. I don't need to remind you of what's riding on this. Take down that guardian! 
Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold wants you to kill Sharax the Defiler.	The Defiler	The Jadefire satyrs of Felwood have found their way into Darkshore, tainting the land, water, and creatures they encounter. You've seen what their corruption has done to my people and their homes. If we do not turn back the satyrs, all of us will share that fate. Within the cave to the east is Sharax the Defiler, the satyr responsible for the ills of the Blackwood. Slay him, George, and free us from his influence. Show the satyr that the Blackwood will not lay down and die so easily. 
Collect 7 Pieces of Pure Glacier Ice from the cavern in Icethistle Hills.	Fresh From The Hills	Ice this time? Hoo boy, sure. I've got good news and bad news for you. The good news is there's a bunch of pure solid ice over in the Ice Thistle Hills cavern, straight east from Everlook. The bad news is there's also a bunch of vicious yetis in there. But if you can handle the yeti, hey, piece of cake! Just walk right up to the bigger chunks and crack 'em open with your weapon. Bring it all back to me and I'll do my thing. 
Deliver Magni Bronzebeard's message.	The Blood of Azeroth	Do the leaders of the Alliance and Horde even know what they're fightin' over? This substance that is risin' up from the wound is the lifeblood of Azeroth! We need ta heal the wound, not exploit it fer power! Azeroth is the only home we've got. We cannot allow her ta die! I trust ye, George, and I know that yer voice carries great weight among the Alliance. Ye must reason with 'em ta stop this madness!'Tis the only hope our world has... 
Attach the tug's tow hook to 10 Dead Employees.	We All Scream for Ice Cream... and then Die!	Don't get me wrong... I'm cheerful on the outside, but inside I'm just terribly torn to pieces. All of my friends and employees are dead. Could you do me a favor? Would you swim down there and attach the tug's tow hook to my dead employees? I'll reel them in. 
Speak to Kalen Trueshot at Trueshot Point in Stonetalon Mountains.	Do Yourself a Favor	So these night elves send out a desperate call for help to us, goes something like this:<Gnombus changes the pitch of his voice to sound like a woman.>""Please come help us! The big, mean Horde has goblins! Oh, we can't handle goblins! They pull our hair and make us cry!""Right, anyway, so here we are. The first thing I did was upgrade their aerial defenses with some of my new sniper guns. Problem is, they don't use guns. Do yourself a favor and lend 'em a hand, eh? Find 'em south of here. 
Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 10 Silithid Meat.	Gorishi Grub	The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips. It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in the center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling. 
Collect 5 Satyrnaar Fel Wood.	A Shameful Waste	Welcome to Forest Song, Mechanic. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambition requires a steady stream of materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the west have no such reverence for the forest. We shall reclaim the tainted wood from Satyrnaar to the west. Take the wood to Gnarl at the Warsong Lumber Camp. He is an Ancient who will purify it for our use. 
Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest wants you to slay 8 Sunhawk Saboteurs and 8 Sunhawk Agents.	Clearing the Way	Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless of draenei will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide...<Corin sighs.>My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be. 
Speak to Salhet at the Ramkahen Legion Outpost in Uldum.	The Weakest Link	They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. I subscribe to that theory and expand upon it. Rather than removing that weak link, one must... strengthen it. The other links will step up their performance out of fear of they themselves becoming the weakest link. In my army's case, our weak link has a name. Salhet. You'll find him training near the bottom of those stairs. Start him off with something easy. The hyenas on the hills to the west, perhaps. 
	Urgent Delivery	 
Slay Grolnar the Berserk.	Bearzerker	High Chieftain Winterfall's absence has done little to quell the rage of the Winterfall. In his absence, their greatest warrior has rose to a position of terrible power. Grolnar the Berserk lurks in the cave at the top of Winterfall Village, gorged on enough corrupt firewater to kill ten lesser furbolgs. He has become a bloated and horrible beast! Our warriors have been unable to face him... do you have the strength to defeat him, Mechanic? 
Slay Shy-Rotam.	Shy-Rotam	Time for the big kill, pal! Shy-Rotam lurks in the north, the largest frostsaber of them all. You should feel honored. There's no fiercer game for a hunter to match their skills against... and if you saw the cash I'm being offered by gourmands that want a piece of this fellow, your eyes would pop out! Once you've got her, head on back to camp. Don't want to totally exhaust our frostsaber population in one day... 
Plant the Witchbane Torch at the end of the dock and defeat the evil haunting Witch Hill.	Cleansing Witch Hill	The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth. I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal... if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and Jarl's, I wish you luck. 
Karnum Marshweaver wants you to speak with Mai'Lahii.	Shadowprey Village	Hello again, Mechanic. I have received news that Shadowprey Village is in need of some assistance. Our hands are more than full here, so I must call upon you to travel there and be of assistance to them. The village lies on the coast to the southwest of here. When you arrive, seek out the one named Mai'Lahii. 
Return to Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Hyjal.	An Ancient Awakens	I slumbered in the healing silt of Hyjal. I slept until the world broke open. When the others came, I was not ready. I am ready now, Human. My children and I. Slow to anger. But our wrath is final. Tell those who sent you that we are prepared for war. The others will be cast from the mountain. 
Use the Sacred Nectar at Aviana's Burial Circle.	An Offering for Aviana	Although the guardian of all winged creatures is no longer with us in body, I sometimes hear her voice in the whisper of swaying leaves. George, we ask much of you as you set out to preserve this mountain. Before going on, take a moment to reflect. Take this offering of nectar to Aviana's burial circle, a circle of stones just outside the main door of the shrine. Perhaps some time alone with Aviana's memory will help sharpen your focus. 
Search Bilgewater Harbor and convince 12 AWOL Grunts to report for duty.	Ready the Ground Troops	It was a bad idea to muster the troops in this festering goblin metropolis. Every vice that coin can buy is within arm's reach. Our mighty veterans are running rampant, blowing years of Northrend back-pay in a city-wide debacle. Can you make a sweep through the city and gather up any stragglers that have gone AWOL? My axebite warriors are unmatched on the battlefield, but I won't have them disgrace their uniforms while on shore leave. 
Speak with Kranal Fiss at Grol'dom Farm to ensure that his missing kodo arrived safely.	The Kodo's Return	The great beast rises slowly to its feet, the loose Barrens soil spilling from its revitalized limbs. Instinctively it trudges back toward its home at Grol'dom Farm. You'll want to check in with Kranal Fiss to make sure the kodo made it. 
Speak to Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar.	The Battle Is Won, The War Goes On	We've defeated the enemy's forces here, George. But Hyjal is not the only place where our foes are moving against us. I've been informed that our allies in the Earthen Ring have put out a call for aid in a matter I've been assured is most critical. Speak to Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar for further instructions. 
Find the Wooden Key and use it to obtain the Iron Shaft portion of Dartol's Rod.	Search the Bole	I wish your tidings were better. Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted. To find the next piece of the rod, you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in. The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here near the Felwood border, at the Howling Vale. Once you have it, look for a small glade through the tunnel at the vale. The chest should be hidden around there. 
Meet with Cork Fizzlepop at the city gate.	Welcome to Orgrimmar	The warchief will be waiting for our mission report from Exile's Reach. I must deliver it at once. For now, Cork Fizzlepop will show you around the city. Orgrimmar has much to offer, so explore it as you see fit. I'll send for you once I've given my report to the warchief. 
Kill 7 Uprooted Lashers.	Pulling Weeds	With such an abrupt change to the ecology, it is to be expected that some of the flora and fauna don't react as well as we'd hope. The uprooted lashers are a troublesome example of this. Roaming the fields to the east and south they are a detriment to the region and must be disposed of. While you're about, please deal with any of these pests that you find. 
Place Clarice's Pendant on Yuriv's Tomb in Silverpine.	Until Death Do Us Part	Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because ""the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the undead pose.""Well, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty! Well, witness what ""justice"" brings you, George! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop! Take this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the Sepulcher. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him! 
Use the teleportation tree in western Darnassus to reach Rut'theran Village, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel.	Breaking Waves of Change	You! You look able. And perhaps willing to help? Auberdine has finally fallen. Though many of its inhabitants departed long ago when the city first suffered the brunt of the Cataclysm, many of the more stubborn residents are yet unaccounted for. And it now appears that the city may have been overrun by water elementals. My sisters need help rescuing the survivors. Please, Mechanic, use the western tree to reach Rut'theran, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a flight to Lor'danel. Be swift! 
Collect and feed 5 pieces of Charred Basilisk Meat to the Spawn of Smolderos.	Walking the Dog	Hmmmphh.... it seems they'll let anyone in these days. Very well. You doubtlessly became acquainted with Smolderos in the proving grounds. Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups. Quite the little terror -- if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well. Collect meat from the basilisks around the area and feed them to him. 
Speak to Harrison Jones at Pilgrim's Precipice.	Sullah's Gift	Jonesy tells me you two need to make it up that mountain. Well, you're not going far with those troopers crawling all over it like ants on a carcass. Some of my friends were able to confiscate a bit of the enemy's hardware. It should make your journey a bit easier. Make your way up the ridgeline to the north, and you'll find it waiting for you. Good luck, you two! 
Talk to Orseus outside the Grove of the Ancients and mount a hippogryph. From the air, protect 8 Whitetail Deer, 8 Grizzled Thistle Bears, and 8 Moonstalker Matriarchs/Sires from the consumption.	In Defense of Darkshore	Now that we know our preventative measures work, we should cover as much ground as possible. I've arranged to commandeer one of our hippogryphs, but I can't do this alone. Talk to my friend Orseus, next to the flight master right outside the grove here. Let him know when you're ready and I'll meet you there. We'll canvas Darkshore from the air and protect as many animals as we can! 
Slay Warlord Wrathspine inside Nazj'vel.	The Darkscale Warlord	If the naga want to throw in their lot with the Twilight's Hammer, then may Elune have mercy on them. Go into their lair in the island of Nazj'vel and find their leader, the naga warlord known only as Wrathspine. Perhaps the horn of the ancients can still be saved. 
Collect 5 Fungal Spores from mushrooms at the Forgotten Pools.	Fungal Spores	The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery. Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it. Invigorating, and altering. There is a mushroom that grows near the Forgotten Pools to the northwest. Its spores hold properties that we, the apothecaries of Lordaeron, find useful. Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude. 
Collect 8 Mirefin Heads from Mirefin Murlocs.	Hungry as an Ogre!	You meet some people out here sometime. Nice people. Met an ogre once. Ogres get hungry just like me. I'll never forget what he said. He said ""Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you.""So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like. Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too. 
Speak to Nomarch Teneth at the Tahret Grounds, Sun Priest Asaris at the Seal of the Sun King, and Asaq at Mar'at.	Impending Retribution	Now that you've been suitably rewarded, I hope I can speak with you frankly. You've done my kingdom a great favor, but you've also unbalanced a fragile peace process. I was pursuing my brother's release strictly through diplomatic means in order to avoid bloodshed. Now, the enemy is sure to seek retaliation. Speak to Nomarch Teneth at the Tahret Grounds to the east, Sun Priest Asaris at the Seal of the Sun King to the north and Asaq at Mar'at to the west. Find out where the enemy will strike. 
Get information about Reethe from Balos Jacken and the deserters in Dustwallow Marsh.	The Deserters	It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive watchtowers throughout the area. The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at Lost Point, southeast of the inn. The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him. Be warned, George. He may be a tough nut to crack. 
Slay High Cultist Azerynn and 10 Twilight Fanatics in the Twilight Encampment.	The Twilight's Hammer	A group of Twilight's Hammer cultists has set up camp southwest of here. They're preparing an army of water elementals to use against Lor'danel. Their leader, High Cultist Azerynn, has pacts with the dark Old Gods that grant his sect power over the elements. Go and deal with them before it's too late, George. The cataclysm has left the elemental spirits in disarray... it's only a matter of time until they have enough elementals to overcome our defenses. 
Slay General Skessesh and take his head.	General Skessesh	The leader of these forces must fall! The naga's offensive will be broken with no one to command them. I saw the coward retreat into one of the abandoned buildings here. Cut your way through the others and take his head! Lady Shandris will want to see it for herself. 
Sneak into the Master's Glaive using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer leaders on the platform above.	Stepping Up Surveillance	The cultists appear to be digging out the remains of a being known as Soggoth the Slitherer. Perhaps their superiors on the rafters above have more information. 
Relive Illidan's battle for the Skull of Gul'dan.	The Skull of Gul'dan	Illidan set out to find the Skull of Gul'dan. He fought through armies of demons to reach it, slaying them with the power that made him a hated outcast. See him in battle, Mechanic. Witness the one that fought the fiercest against the corruptors of Felwood, and struck at its source. 
Bring 4 Venomhide Ravasaur Eggs to Mor'vek in the southeast part of the Marshlands.	Venomhide Eggs	Now that you've built up an immunity to venomhide toxin, you can safely handle the animals and their eggs. Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch. If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides. If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance. 
Bring the Smoldering Timewarped Ember to Kiatke in Orgrimmar.	The Smoldering Ember	Cold to the touch when you first reach for it, this ember bursts into flame without warning and snuffs itself just as quickly. As the stone rests in your hand, visions of fire and of dragons dance through your mind, but you can hear conversation taking place in Orgrimmar and the familiar sight of circle portals bubbles to the top. 
Locate the Twilight Apocrypha inside of Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal.	Mastering Puppets	<During your brief communion with the Eye, you felt that its power source lay deep within the hovel. You felt the weight of a powerful tome, binding together four elements.><Mastering the Eye will require you to search the hovel for this tome.> 
Retrieve 3 Moonstalker Whiskers, 3 Tufts of Mottled Doe Hair, and 3 Thistle Bear Fur.	Ritual Materials	While we tend to Grimclaw, I would like you to peacefully gather some ritual materials for me from the nearby wildlife. I need whiskers from the moonstalkers to the west- pluck them from the sleeping ones and move away quickly. I need hair from the doe to the east, just avoid the stags. Finally, I need fur from the bears along the water to the northeast. Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating. Please do not harm any of them. 
Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Impact Site Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.	Learning from the Crystals	Welcome to Blood Watch, Mechanic. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar. The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island. The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge. 
Use a Goblin Mortar to slaughter 60 Spitelash Attackers.	First Degree Mortar	Hey bud! Like explosions? Of course you do. Who doesn't like explosions?!I've got mortars set up on the ridge to the east to hold the naga back. Go forth, recruit. Mortar them... mortar them all! Ahahahah. 
Retrieve Feero's Holy Hammer and The Purifier's Prayer Book.	Respect for the Fallen	There were two humans here: Feero Ironhand and Delgren the Purifier. They were members of a holy organization known as The Argent Dawn. Both fell defending the post when the Horde first attacked. I'm going to loan you my magical cloak. It was a gift from Cenarius that allows me to move invisibly. Find both of their corpses and retrieve Feero's hammer and Delgren's prayer book. Feero's corpse is in the courtyard and Delgren's is atop the tower. Beware, the warlock up there will be able to see you. 
Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel wants you to lay the Wreath at the Hyal Family Monument.	Peace at Last	I wish we had a way of letting James Hyal's wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice.<Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers.>There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the stones in the graveyard just north of Theramore's gates. 
Obtain the Emerald Scroll from the Nightmare Guardian inside the Earthshatter Cavern.	The Waking Nightmare	Malfurion's words are true, small one. The rift that threatens to split Darkshore in half also threatens the separation between this world and yours. Let me aid you in any way that I can, lest further rifts between our worlds amplify the destruction taking place in both places. First you must undo the shackles cast upon me by retrieving the emerald scroll from the nightmare guardian that roams the halls below. 
Slay 12 defenders inside Shadow Hold.	The Inner Circle	With their outer sentries gone, the greater members of the Shadow Council are next. Deep within the corrupted barrow dens you'll find powerful Jaedenar Warlocks, Hunters, Enforcers, Darkweavers, and Legionnaires. They must be defeated if these lands are to be saved! 
Gather 6 pieces of Shardtooth Meat from any of the Shardtooth bears in Winterspring and feed them to your Winterspring Cub.	A Cub's Cravings	Your Winterspring cub looks at you and licks its lips. The little cat must be hungry and it's up to you to find a suitable meal for your charge. Rivern Frostwind mentioned keeping some shardtooth bear meat on hand for feeding his frostsaber cubs. Perhaps your cub would enjoy some fresh shardtooth meat of its own. Various kinds of shardtooth bears can be found all over Winterspring. 
Find and speak to the notorious pirate Baron Longshore.	Find Baron Longshore	That dirty pirate Baron Longshore was the terror of these waters before the Alliance demolished his fleet and rounded up the survivors. Am I happy about it? Do I look like a bundle of joy and good cheer, George? Longshore raided some of my most valuable cargo before his capture. Rumor has it he buried it before he was caught. I want my goods back! Find Longshore in the Alliance camp just south of here and see if you can get him to reveal where my treasure is. 
Touch the Eastern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater.	The Eastern Pylon	High up in the cliffs above me there is a large crystal pylon. Who placed it there, I cannot say, nor can I determine any reason that it would be built in such a strange place. Maybe you can make more of it than I can. I personally don't care what it does, so you needn't report back to me, but perhaps one of the scholars in Marshal's Stand might be interested in what you discover. 
Slay Bingham Gadgetspring in the Ruined Reaches, along with 4 Netgun Gnomes and 6 Zapper Gnomes.	The Terrible Tinkers of the Ruined Reaches	Scoundrels! Infidels! Ever since I started my operation here in Azshara the Gadgetspring family has hampered my studies and sabotaged my research. And now a mob of middling, second-rate tinkers have rallied to their aid! I have pressing business to attend to: see to it that those gnomes are finished for good. Head to the Ruined Reaches on the coast, south of my Secret Lab, and start rolling some of their disproportionately enormous heads for me. 
Defeat the Withered Protector.	The Last Protector	Ahhh... thank you, little Human. I and others have tried so many times to grow in this forest, without success. The Withered Protector that lurks in the north is the only ancient to have grown to maturity since the ruining of the forest, but his body is sick and his mind is mad. Just as we gathered the spirits of the treants, I would save those that dwell in him rather than leave them behind. Defeat him, and let his spirits join me before I set my roots. 
Take Auch'naaru from Vorpil Ribcleaver in Telmor.	The Final Piece	I am too injured to fight, Mechanic. I have failed my city and its people. This battle is yours. Vorpil waits just ahead. He's trying to use Auch'naaru's powers for some sort of dark ritual. You must do what I could not. Cut Vorpil down and retrieve Auch'naaru so the Heart of Auchindoun can be whole once more! 
Slay 8 Frostmaul Tumblers.	Chips off the Old Block	My mysterious benefactors gave me more than one task. The second task took me farther south, to the Frostwhisper Gorge. I was surprised to learn that the gorge's bridge had been broken in two, preventing land travel from one side to the other. In addition, the juvenile Frostmaul tumblers were separated from their stronger adult parents. I thought that I could defeat them in battle. I was incorrect. I was forced to run away in shame. Teach these tumblers a lesson, George. Fight them, and win. 
Draaka in Splintertree wants you to fill the Reinforced Canister with 7 Felfires from Felfire Hill.	Playing With Felfire	<Draaka leans down to speak to you.>Listen... Before you say anything, I KNOW we're not to meddle with demonic energies....But look around you! These are desperate times, Mechanic. We'll most likely die here, regardless. May as well go out in a blaze of glory, I say! So... Are you in? Take this canister and go southeast to Felfire Hill. Use it near the patches of felfire and bring it back to me when you've filled it. Oh, and best not to mention this to anyone.... 
Kill 5 Razormane Defenders, 5 Razormane Thornweavers, and Kreenig Snarlsnout. Take Snarlsnout's Tusk.	The Far Watch Offensive	Pigmen running amok right on the border of Durotar? Not on my watch! It is as they say, George: The best defense is crushing all who oppose you. One of my scouts followed the quilboar after the last caravan raid, so we know where to strike. Kreenig Snarlsnout is the mastermind behind the attacks along the river. Crush him, Mechanic. Defeat him and disembowel his forces so that the attacks on this camp cease. Search for a quilboar-infested cavern along the river, just south of our stables. 
Slay Vyral the Vile and obtain Vyral's Signet Ring.	Vyral the Vile	We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer. It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus. The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat. When you have done this, bring me his signet ring. Fortune to you, George. The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed. 
Use Sullah's Harness to tame 3 Camels.	Camelraderie	Greetings, friend! You are always most welcome in my humble tent. Looking for something to do? Sullah has just the thing! Camels are good to have in hand regardless, but when putting together a performance the likes of my sideshow, they are an absolute must! Take this harness and use it to subdue a wandering camel. You may have to, uhh, humble it a bit first... if you know what I mean. You'll find a desert full of wild camels to the south. 
Free the spirit of Anaya Dawnrunner and retrieve her pendant.	A Love Eternal	I would like to extend my gratitude for saving us. I would call myself fortunate, but my beloved, Anaya, lays long dead. I am alone and deeply troubled, and sadly, I require your aid yet again. Wandering the woods of Darkshore after my rescue, I found myself in the ruins of Bashal'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved. She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed. 
Kill Sarkoth and bring his claw back to Hana'zua.	Sarkoth	Mechanic! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg. I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south. 
Use the Kobold War Horn near the Horde Banner at the Unearthed Grounds to unleash the Kobold Army!	Kobold Fury!	We now command the kobold armies of Stonetalon! It almost sounds impressive. Almost.<Devo sighs.>The Alliance base camp north of here is tightly guarded. It is nigh impregnable, save for the entry point by the Unearthed Grounds, northeast of here. Take this kobold war horn and head towards the Unearthed Grounds. Enter from the east, George! Once there, head west until you arrive at the location I have marked upon your map. Use the horn there to unleash kobold fury upon the Alliance! 
Kill 5 Deviate Terrortooths and 5 Deviate Plainstriders.	Biological Intervention	The energies unleashed here have surged through the wildlife, twisting them into powerful and unstable forms. If allowed to spread beyond this grove, these deviates will wreak havoc on the existing ecosystem, devouring local prey and driving out the weaker natural creatures. You must go and cull the population of the overgrowth. Return when this task is done. 
Take the Pure Twilight Egg to Aronus at the Gates of Sothann in Hyjal.	The Twilight Egg	The egg is unlike any that you've seen before. Its translucent shell appears to bend the light around it. Accompanying it, you find a note describing the arrival of a fertile broodmother at the Ascendant's Rise. Perhaps you should show this to Aronus. 
Release five Experimental Raptors from their cages in the Secret Lab and deliver them to the rocket beside Subject Nine.	Raptor Raptor Rocket	Shortly after my intellect was augmented, I bred with Subject Four in order to create a unique race of cognitively superior raptors. Subsequently, Subject Four neither called nor wrote: I have determined to disembowel him upon our next encounter. Nonetheless, there are enough raptor children imprisoned in this lab to provide adequate genetic stock for repopulating my race. Please release them from their cages and carry them to the rocket. 
Defeat Retinus the Seeker in a pet battle with your Shadowbarb Hatchling in your party.	Someone His Own Size	While fighting alongside you no doubt provides excellent training for our hatchling, sometimes it is better to have him fight on his own against enemies his own size. I know of one such opponent nearby, observing the Amathet near the Obelisk of the Stars. You should seek it out. 
Speak with Karthog, then lure out and assassinate General Hawthorne.	The Butcher of Taurajo	This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move.<Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist.>It's HIM, George! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo! Now we know when and where to strike him down. Quickly, follow the road north of the Battlescar and meet up with my assassin Karthog. CRUSH Hawthorne and string his body up along the road! 
Report to Gor the Enforcer at the Dranosh'ar Blockade in Durotar.	The Dranosh'ar Blockade	You should head north from here, George. Speak with Gor the Enforcer at the Dranosh'ar Blockade. He's been placed in charge of securing shipping lanes for Orgrimmar, and Skull Rock sits right next to his precious dock. I'm certain he'll be interested in picking up where we left off. 
If you trust him, talk to Baron Longshore to free him from his manacles.	The Baron's Demands	I'm bound fer that gallows fer sure, mate. That treasure's no good to me now...Unless I can use it ta buy me life. I'll make a deal with ye, Human. Smash these manacles and I'll tell ye where me treasure's buried. Oh, me word is good, friend. I used ta be a real Baron, ye know. 
Use the Scraps of Rotting Meat on nearby dinosaurs to lure them into the pits around Marshal's Stand.	How to Make Meat Fresh Again	I don't believe we've met... I'm Nolen Tacker, Marshal Expeditions' new chief of the guards. I'm also their chef. There's actually more overlap than you'd think. I've got a fun little task for you. Have you seen the spike pits around the perimeter of the camp? See if you can convince some of the nearby dinosaurs to walk into them. If you throw this rotten meat at them when they're not looking, it'll either make them hungry or angry. Either way is fine, as long as they follow you into the pit! 
Escort Mist to Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak at the moon well near the Oracle Tree.	Mist	The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach. She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes. She seems to wish to follow you. 
Gather 4 Corrupted Tide Crawler Flesh samples and bring them to Buzzbox 413 for analysis.	Buzzbox 413	Greetings! I'm helping Tharnariun here try to unravel what's been corrupting the wildlife in the area. I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly. The first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it. 
Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. Optionally, grab a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Silithus!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold. You are to aid our Cenarion allies in their battle to turn back Twilight's Hammer. Cho'Gall's minions must not be allowed to dominate Silithus! You can reach Silithus by taking the northwestern road out of Un'Goro Crater. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! 
Commander Schnottz wants you to persuade 6 Slacking Laborers to get to work.	Make Yourself Useful	Gobbles vill be sorely missed, but zhe mission must not suffer. Perhaps zhere is somezhink you can do to redeem yourself. Take vone of zhe uniforms you recovered. Vhile vearink it, my vorkers vill not behave so... aggressively. Lately, zheir morale has been a bit lackink. Some of zhe vorkers are refusing to perform zheir labors. Auch, zhe audacity! Find zhese lazy imbeciles and convince zhem zhat zhey must get to vork... or else! 
Retrieve 6 Samples of Foul Ichor from the creatures inside Cliffspring Hollow.	A Cure In The Dark	<Some unintelligible speech spews forth from the machine before you make out Wizbang's voice again.>Duskrats! They've been eating the duskrats! Those little buggers only come from one place, a cave against the cliff-face to the east. Find a path up to the northeast and look for an opening under the waterfall. The duskrats there are either getting into something nasty or someone's intentionally spreading some agent through them - in either case, just bring me back several samples of the stuff! 
Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.	A Hearty Thanks!	You saved my life, George! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you. If you see the exarch at Azure Watch, tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news! 
Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your Aqir Hatchling and battle enemies in Uldum or Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Fighting tougher and rarer enemies will help your hatchling grow faster.	Honing Instincts	It looks like our little friend is anxious and ready to practice more combat. Would you care to show him the ropes? 
Destroy 8 Unbudging Rocks.	A Helping Hand	I've been pushing and shoving and hammering all morning, but it's hopeless. These rocks won't budge!""It will be a breeze,"" Grandpa said. ""Farming's like breathing!"" he said. Maybe for him, but not for me! How am I supposed to succeed at this whole FARMING thing if I can't even clear my farm for planting? Hey, wait a minute. You look like you've got some muscle on you. Would you be willing to help me out? Just until I can catch my breath. 
Collect Elune's Tear.	Elune's Tear	I'd hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through her. We must find more powerful medicine! Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies should his first one fail. Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the remains of Iris Lake, destroyed by the eruption of Thunder Peak, northeast of Astranaar. Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption. Please, George, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness! 
Kill 10 Ironfur Bears or Longtooth Runners, and use the Beast Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen beasts.	Testing the Vessel	Master Uzer'i's taught me in the ways of making spirit weapons of great power. I'll help you set on the path to make some, and you'll give me the chance to practice my craft. This vessel can shrink and trap a defeated creature inside of it. We'll need the muisek of beasts first; ironfur bears and longtooth wolves. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape. 
Collect 5 Bloodfen Feathers from Bloodfen Raptors.	Bloodfen Feathers	Are you startled by Brogg's presence here, little Human? Don't worry. Goblins at Mudsprocket are Brogg's friends and you can be, too. Brogg left Brackenwall Village when new overlord not take revenge against black dragonkin for destroying old home and killing many of Brogg's old friends. Brogg come here to lay friends spirits to rest and avenge them, but Brogg need help preparing. For ritual, Brogg need feathers with strong magic, like ones worn by raptors at Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. 
Use the portal behind Joanna at Xylem's tower to find Anara the Spirit Healer and--hopefully--Azuregos.	Wasn't It Obvious?	Azuregos! Yes, of course. Troubled old dragon, but lovely heart. I don't think all the years of vagabonds assaulting him have done him much good. He's a mite strange these days. Not long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company. The portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though. 
Collect 12 Chunks of Meat from beasts in Uldum and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	A Balanced Diet	Now that our larva is hatched, we'll need to figure out what we can feed it to keep it healthy. It would seem that the aqir are carnivores, but the only things I've seen them eat are... well... us. Of course, we can't feed our little friend people, so we'll have to find an alternative. Perhaps we could substitute animal meat? 
Defeat the Aqir Sandcrawler in a pet battle with your Shadowbarb Hatchling in your party.	Big Bad Beetle	It could do our hatchling some good to face off against another aqir, to learn what his kind are capable of. I have found an opponent who could provide a challenging fight. 
Slay 3 Andorhal Force-Commanders.	Ashes to Ashes	To the west, deep within Alliance-held Andorhal, you will find their commanders. They do not fight, but call out orders from horseback. Hunt down and slay these commanders, George. The humans won't stand a chance. 
Collect Evil Dolly's Heart, Seadog Fajardo's Lungs, and Lilly Landlubber's Liver.	With a Little Help...	Fine, I be helpin' ya. He not gettin' outa payin' me alimony that easy! 'Sides, there be the baby he had with me sistah ta take care of! First thing we needin' is the innards of his closest friends. That'd be his cap'ns. Go down there an' pay the three of them a visit. 
Collect the Orb of the Morning Star, the Orb of the Evening Star, Orb of the North Star and the Orb of the Shooting Star.	After the Fall	Aww, that was nothin', really. Those statues were teetering as it was - just needed a little push is all. How about you go and sort through that rubble? I've got a feeling we're close to getting this all sorted out. 
Use the shredder's buzzsaw to cut down Azshara Saplings, and kill 9 Talrendis Snipers as they emerge.	Up a Tree	Hold still a second, I'm going to bring your main buzzsaw controls online. Night elven snipers from Talrendis have been hiding in the trees, taking potshots at my workers. I want you to take care of those snipers... by first taking care of those trees. Look for Azshara saplings east of the main gates. Your shredder will know what to do. Chop to it! 
Kill the Gorishi Fledgling Colossus.	The Fledgling Colossus	If you're here to help, then maybe you can help us with a lurking threat. To the south lies the Slithering Scar, a quivering silithid outpost in the middle of the jungle. You can't miss it. One of my scouts reports that the silithid are harboring a young colossus in their large central underground chamber, and once it is fully grown, they plan to unleash it upon Un'Goro! This must not be allowed to pass, George. Find the colossus and kill it. 
Talk to Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing in Dustwallow Marsh.	Is it Real?	Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends? If you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle. He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay. 
Disable Magatha's Bonds Controller.	The Elder Crone	You have the code. Now all you have to do is head to the eastern section of the Bulwark and free the Elder Crone. Good luck, George. Thank you for all you've done. 
Use Ysondre's Tear to seal the portal at Dream Bough.	Sealing the Dream	It is ready. Take this, George; a beacon of natural essence, blessed by the will of Ysondre. To the north, on the other side of the flowing brook, is Dream Bough. There stands the Great Tree, the tallest in Feralas, a sapling of the very World Tree. A portal to the heart of the Emerald Dream sits in its trunk, and it is this portal you must seal. The portal will be guarded, but you must be brave. 
Report to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace.	Warchief's Command: Desolace!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace. The brave Horde warriors of Desolace need your help to beat back the armies of the Alliance and ancient demons. To reach Tethris Aran, travel south from the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains. Destiny calls! 
Obtain a Cliff Stormer Heart.	Da Voodoo: Stormer Heart	With voodoo, our troops might have a chance at beating back the Grimtotem assault. With that said, I need several ingredients if I am to invoke black magic. The first ingredient on my list is a heart from a cliff stormer. The beasts have nearly been hunted to extinction, but a few still exist around these parts. Find one and recover its beating heart! 
Collect 10 Rocket Car Parts.	Down in the Deeps	Well, friend, if Pozzik wants you to have your own boat, the first thing we're going to need is parts. Now guess who gets to go get them?<Razzeric smiles as he points downward and then grabs you a spare diving helm and flippers.>I'm afraid so, George. You get to go down into the deeps and salvage what rocket car parts you can find at the Raceway Ruins. 
Get the Ignition Key from Supervisor Lugwizzle.	Ignition	I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem. We need to get out of here on the double! Search the upper level of the derrick, Supervisor Lugwizzle should have a key for this shredder. Help me out here! 
Find a resident of Stormwind City to accept your Forged Documents.	Forged Documents	Find a resident in Stormwind City to accept your forged documents. 
Obtain 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands.	The Scent of Lar'korwi	I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, George. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us. Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands. 
Report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand in Un'Goro Crater. Optionally, grab a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Un'Goro Crater!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand. You are to provide aid to the Marshal Expeditions' personnel as they uncover the secrets of Un'Goro Crater. The Horde may be able to find a use for the unique beasts and crystals populating the crater. You can reach Un'Goro Crater by taking the road from western Tanaris down into the crater and toward Marshal's Stand. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! 
Speak with Captain Garrick at Stormwind Keep.	An Urgent Meeting	I've been looking for you all over Stormwind, George. The captain has delivered her report to the king. It appears that Stormwind requires your service yet again. The leaders of the Alliance have gathered together for a meeting at Stormwind Keep, and your presence has been requested by King Wrynn himself. I was instructed to find you and deliver the message without delay. It has been an honor serving with you, George. May the Light bless you on your journey. 
Retrieve 8 Highborne Relics.	Remnants of the Highborne	There are several ruins similar to these spread through Darkshore, many of them inhabited by the troubled spirits of the Highborne. Out of mild courtesy for their cursed souls, we haven't been overly proactive about stripping the ruins of artifacts, but those hesitancies vanish in light of this new troll threat. While you're aiding the Sentinels in their goals within the ruins, please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them back to me. I would like to preserve what little I can. 
Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from Irontree Cavern.	Borrowed Bombs	The workers in Irontree Cavern below us have been driven out already. Something else has overtaken the cave. This works in our favor. I spotted at least a few of them dropping explosives as they fled... explosives we'll need for the next part of our plan. Enter the cave and salvage any abandoned bombs you can find. When you're finished with that and the pump, we'll begin our final assault. 
Sink 15 Southsea Rowboats.	Circle the Wagons... er, Boats	The fires may be dealt with, but those Southsea pirates are still getting ready to board the Speedbarge! George, you need to go back to Mazzer Stripscrew and get on your boat. Use the cannon to sink them before it's too late! 
Kill 8 Razormane Plunderers and 3 Razormane Hunters.	In Defense of Far Watch	All the quilboars are our enemies, George. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others. The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply caravans that roll through here from Orgrimmar. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us. Start just south of here, where they've been raiding our camps near the river. Seek them out, and slay them. 
Create the Titan Activation Device.	They Don't Know What They've Got Here	Listen, George. I don't have a lot of time to talk here. These guys are excavating relics from this site and taking pieces of ancient technology that we need! I need you to check their crates for pieces of an ancient activation device. The officers should have the codes you'll need to open them. Hurry! We can't let them load this stuff into their planes! 
	Encrypted Twilight Texts	 
Obtain the Core Access Codes from Twizzleflux the Insane.	Core Access Codes	The expedition's numbers are extremely large, user George. Dealing with them by conventional means would take you an estimated 2,700,136. 5 hours. We can make use of a powerful source of energy held within expedition's crawler vehicle. We will need the fusion core's access codes to accomplish this. Mekgineer Twizzleflux has these codes and can be found at the Starwatch Tower to the southeast. I've uploaded jamming frequencies to a scrambler. Use it to temporarily disable Twizzleflux's defenses. 
Find signs of Ringo at Fire Plume Ridge.	Lost!	You've got to help me, George! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the north of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him. Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it! 
Obtain the Twilight Communique and the Hyjal Battleplans.	Gather the Intelligence	It's me, George, Ortell! Don't look directly at the outhouse... you'll give away my position. Everything's going according to plan then? Excellent! I'm going to need you to obtain some intelligence while you're here. It might not seem like much to get our hands on a map or a letter, but it may mean saving a hundred lives on our side if we can anticipate our enemy's next move. 
Kill 10 Noxious Whelps.	More Than Illness	I've discovered a brood of dragon whelps gathered off the road to the north with a similar affliction. Green dragons are sacred custodians of nature. The fact that this disease is capable of spreading to them is cause for great alarm. We must stop this from spreading further through any means. Slay the infected whelps, George, and return to me. 
Speak to Sandrya Moonfall to start the attack, and aid her in killing Jor'kil the Soulripper.	Ending the Threat	Their leader and his guard are before us. My Sentinels are ready to take care of his guard, we only awaited this arrow to seal their leader's fate. Let me know when you are prepared to attack. As soon as my Sentinels engage, I will shatter the leader's shield, and we will assault him together. Strike swiftly and we can rout this threat to our lands here and now. We await only you - speak to me when ready. 
Use the Lifebringer Sapling on the shore of the shallow lake south of the Grove of the Ancients to destroy the Devouring Artifact and its guardian.	The Devourer of Darkshore	Now that the creatures of Darkshore are safe, let's turn our attention to the artifact you found in the lake. I believe it's the work of a minion of the Old Gods. We'll fight these fiends using the very lifegiving energies of Darkshore itself! Take the Lifebringer Sapling to the shore of the shallow lake to the south of here. Wave it over the waters of the lake and it should disable that ancient artifact. Be careful, George. The artifact is likely to be guarded by who-knows-what. 
Bring Shadumbra's Head to Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch.	Shadumbra's Head	The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it. This legenday creature is dear to the night elves. Its head should serve as an intimidating trophy, and as a sign of the end of the Alliance in Ashenvale. Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch will no doubt be delighted to receive the head of the slain nightsaber. 
Kill Ursius.	Ursius	I've heard it said that you are what you eat. I don't know if I believe that, but if it's true... I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find. Ursius is the largest bear in Winterspring. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a chimaera or an owlbear. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females. He is my kind of bear. I want to eat him. His cave is near the maulers. Good luck! 
Escort Ruul, then speak with Yama Snowhoof in Splintertree Post.	Freedom to Ruul	Eh? Who are you? George? You're no furbolg. They are cursed! They thought I was a bear and captured me, and now they starve me! My strength is failing...Help me escape, then speak with my sister Yama at the Splintertree Post to the east. George! I must escape! 
Deliver the Glowing Gem to Shael'dryn at Raynewood Tower in Ashenvale.	Dryad Delivery	Ah, there you are, George. I've pored over the notes Teronis has made and it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of Dartol's rod. I would start by heading east along the road to Raynewood Tower. A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out. Keep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod. 
Defeat 5 Servants of Neptulon. (You must be in naga form when you defeat them.)If you lose your Slitherblade Trident, speak to Valishj. If you lose your Slitherblade Charm, speak with Korrah at Ethel Rethor.	Wetter Than Wet	Neptulon's minions have arrived here and are doing all they can to thwart us. Clearly, they've discovered our motives. This only confirms my suspicion that what we seek is indeed somewhere in these ruins! These water elementals are no match for our forces! Take this trident and use it to destroy the worthless servants of the Tidehunter. When we find what we seek here, Neptulon himself shall fear for his life! 
Speak to Ysera at Nordrassil in Hyjal.	Return to Nordrassil	I will take Fandral to Moonglade swiftly. I hope to return soon so I may continue to aid in the battle. In the meantime, report back to Ysera and inform her of these recent developments. 
Bring Ursangous' Paw to Captain Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge.	Ursangous' Paw	The mighty bear Ursangous is no more! The small quarter-crescent emblem on its paw indicates that this beast was trained by the night elves to prowl the forest in search of their enemies. There is no telling how many of your Horde allies fell to this creature. The paw should be brought to Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge. He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal. 
Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to collect 8 Twilight Tablet Fragments.	The Twilight Mystery	A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here. If you were to venture there now, you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was. I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site, but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful. See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus. 
Take the Mark of Bloodhoof to High Overlord Saurfang, located in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar. You may speak with Tal the Wind Rider Master to travel there, or wait for the zeppelin.	Walk With The Earth Mother	Much has changed outside of Mulgore, George. The world is torn, and our Horde allies have turned down dark paths. We must guide them. Even in the darkest hour, we will bravely hold our heads high, and honor the Earth Mother in all we do. You must go, George, and be this example. Go to Orgrimmar. Tell Saurfang how the Grimtotem were driven out. Let him know our pride and discipline, our strength and sorrow. Tal at the Skytower will send you on your way. Go in peace, and never forget your people. 
Rescue three Injured Fawns from The Inferno and escort them back to Mylune at the Grove of Aessina.	Oh, Deer!	Do you speak deer? It's all in the nose.<She points to her nose.>The does have fled the fires, but their little fawns - Some of them are still trapped in the burning and the hurt! Go back into the Inferno and escort three injured fawns back here to their mothers right here beside me. Please save the little fawns, or I'll give you the big eyes!<Her eyes grow big and dewy.> 
Escort a Child of Tortolla to a Nemesis Crystal. See Garunda Mountainpeak if you lose your companion.	The Strength of Tortolla	The dark usurper Nemesis fled here when the fires of Hyjal receded. We are not yet strong enough to defeat Nemesis, George, but we may be able to turn his own strength against him. I will send a child of Tortolla with you, one of the children you freed earlier from the Twilight's corruption. Search the depths of this cave for a Nemesis Crystal, and allow the young turtle to examine it. See me if you lose your companion! 
Plant Ruckus' Territorial Claim Flag next to the prime real estate locations along the Shattered Strand.	First Come, First Served	There's some gorgeous beach front property along the shore. I can market this stuff for 10 times what construction will cost me. The prime spots are that naga pagoda to the south, the tower right next to the water, and the ruins at the far northern end of the beach. I'll give you some coin if you claim them for me before the fighting clears out. 
Use Calder's Bonesaw on corpses within the Battlescar and collect 15 Severed Extremities.	Parts-is-Parts	I've always wanted to try making an abomination. It looks simple enough, but you know how it is when you learn things from a book. There's no substitute for doing! First, I'm going to need parts. Lots of parts. And you're going to get them for me. No need to be picky: human, orc... it doesn't matter. Parts is parts. Just be sure the corpses you harvest come from the Battlescar, so I know they're fresh.<Calder presses a rusted, gore-covered bonesaw into your hands and smiles disarmingly.> 
Kill 8 Hunter Hill Scouts.	Running the Gauntlet	Look around you, Mechanic. We've had no luck dislodging the Horde from the hidden trails that overlook this valley. They appear out of nowhere to ambush our supply caravans and then disappear into the hills! I need you to run the gauntlet to Honor's Stand and let them know the roads still aren't safe. Talk to Mattingly, the supplies officer by the gate. And kill a few of these brutes along the way! 
Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to get 5 pieces of Searing Roc Plumage.	Searing Roc Feathers	The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand. It scrawls a picture of a pair of feathers in the dirt, then points with one claw to the bindings at its elbows and knees. It doesn't seem hungry, but what could the feathers be for? It must want them for adornments like the ones you've seen on other raptors. The largest feathers come from the searing rocs that congregate around the bones of large creatures in western Tanaris, northeast of Thistleshrub Valley. 
Obtain 5 White Ravasaur Claws.	Claws of White	Stop, Human. I could use the help of a Mechanic like you. Right outside this camp, there are raptors with deadly claws. I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working. However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones. The earth works in strange ways. Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time? 
Felgur Twocuts wants you to destroy 10 Lesser Infernals.	Infernal Encroachment	The demons are on the move, Human! If nothing is done, we'll be overrun in a matter of weeks. I've just returned from Mannoroc Coven, where the infernals there are falling from the sky! We need to at least buy ourselves some time. Get down there and pick up where I left off! 
Khan Leh'prah wants you to defeat 15 Burning Blade Warlocks, 3 Doomguard Invaders, and Priestess Than'darissa. Speak to Khan Leh'prah to ride into battle.	Into the Fray!	For untold generations, the centaur clans have fought against one another, but no more. Because of your deeds, we stand here together fighting a common foe. We shall win our ancestral lands back from these demons, or we shall die as brothers. What of you, George? You have earned the right to fight alongside us. I have a group of my best centaurs for you to lead into battle. Will you take up the spear? 
Slay Edana Hatetalon and obtain Edana's Dark Heart.	Dark Heart	Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart. I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen. Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death. 
Slay Feronas Sindweller.	WANTED: The Demon Hunter	Since reclaiming Jadefire Run from the satyr, the Emerald Circle has sent many druids to begin the long task of cleansing the ruins. Last night, several of them were murdered... by a night elf. The witnesses say it was a demon hunter, a crazed disciple of Illidan. A rare sight. No doubt he's gone mad with power just like his master. I'll pay top bounty for proof of this murderer's death. He's been spotted just off the road to the north, in a valley beneath Jadefire Run. 
Scare Legacki with Umi's Mechanical Yeti.	Yetiphobia	It's all ready, George! Now, I told my friend Legacki that I have a surprise for her. This is where you come in! I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you'll get the honor of using it to surprise her. She's just on the other side of Everlook, near the inn. Go up to her and turn the yeti on... I'll be watching from here! 
Take the Decoded Tablet Parchment to Commander Mar'alith.	A Terrible Purpose	Ok, here we are... a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say! I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus. They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they? This will help. Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith. Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good! 
Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater.	Volcanic Activity	Welcome. I'm Williden Marshal, and my sister and I run this expedition of explorers and scientists. You have a moment? I don't like the look of those elementals on that volcano, Mechanic. We have too much equipment, too many notes... one crazed elemental could streak its way through our camp and do terrible, terrible damage. Show them that their new neighbors aren't to be trifled with. And bring back the ash that they leave behind... we might as well do a little science while we're at it. 
Locate Narassin's Tome among the ruins of Althalaxx and kill the Forsaken commander Teegan Holloway.	The Looting of Althalaxx	Before you rejoin the battle, Mechanic, something urgent has come to my attention. My scouts report that the Forsaken are scouring the ruined tower of Althalaxx to our south. Prior to the assault, that bleak tower housed a fanatical arm of the Shadow Council commanded by the fallen highborne Athrikus Narassin. Narassin is long since dead, but if any of his work survives, we can't allow it out of our sight. Retrieve his research and kill the Forsaken commander who's plundering the ruins. 
Obtain 6 Stonetalon Ram Horns.	Da Voodoo: Ram Horns	If I am to invoke voodoo, I will need several special reagents. Bring me horns from the Stonetalon rams of the region, George! Without the horns we are done for! 
Take Brann Bronzebeard's Letter to Bronzebeard's Encampment in southern Silithus.	Brann Bronzebeard's Lost Letter	To Whom It May Concern:If you're reading this, I'm either dead or soon to be dead. It's hard to say. Most of the crew is dead anyhow. Found information about a Titan. Great battle between him and an Old God. Yes, a bona fide Old God. Found ancient tunnel leading to Ahn'Qiraj. Taking it. Take this letter to my old camp. Make sure my monkey is getting adequate food, water, and hugs.-Brann Bronzebeard, Explorer Extreme P.S. Watch out for crazy Old God worshipping night elf. 
Collect 100 Bleached Skulls from Thunder Axe Fortress, then place them at the Burning Blade Summoning Circle, then kill Nazargen.	Putting Their Heads Together	So it's true....The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess. Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs! Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted. 
Recover the Coffer of Promise.	Harrison Jones and the Temple of Uldum	After all we've been through, it looks like everything's actually coming together! We're just steps away from the coffer... I've researched the codes to reveal it... Schnottz thinks we're dead....You know, we might just pull this off after all! 
Locate Grimclaw.	A Lost Companion	Please help... I can barely sit up. My friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it. If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family. 
Use the Shredder to destroy the Talrendis Ancient. Emergency Backup Shredders are available at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate if you lose yours.	Arborcide	How's that shredder holding up? I think I can bring your emergency power supplies online - that'll recharge you when you're wounded. Listen, these night elves are being strengthened by an ancient of war who's taken root just west of the gates. He's a big, giant tree. You know what to do! Take him out! You were made for this!! 
Find Aros northeast of the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore.	The Slumbering Ancients	We may not have twenty stone giants to take on our enemy, but we giants of ancient lumber are as strong as any rock. Look around you, Human. My kindred sleep... yet they will heed the keeper's horn when the time of need is upon them. You will find Aros, the keeper of the grove, beyond the bridge northeast of here. Tell him the urgency of our situation. 
Bring the Writings of the Dark Herald to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel.	Writings of the Void	The scrolls are vague and appear to be a piece of a much larger puzzle, but if you are not mistaken, they seem to reveal some of the steps on the path to becoming a demon hunter. The dark oaths and rituals necessary for becoming a demon hunter are frowned on by most of the night elves, so this is likely something they would be very interested in keeping quiet. Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea will know what to do with these scrolls. 
Find the Winterfall Cauldron at the northern Winterfall camp.	Falling to Corruption	The aggression of the Winterfall furbolg has to have its source somewhere. I'd like to get to the bottom of it if I can! I've seen the furbolg in the camps to the north brewing something in a cauldron. They seemed very protective of it... if whatever they're cooking up is what's causing this, I must examine it myself. Find that cauldron if it's still there, and bring me back what's inside! 
Speak with Halga Bloodeye at Far Watch Post to escort the next Crossroads Caravan to Grol'dom Farm.	Crossroads Caravan Pickup	<Halga grins disarmingly, holding up an enormous firearm.>Have you ever used one of these, George? It's a beast. Hell with a handgrip. Too heavy to use on foot, but perfect when riding at the head of a caravan. I call it my 'street sweeper.'We need to get those supplies you've collected to the Crossroads, and I expect trouble. I'd like for you to ride shotgun. Literally! Say the word when you're ready and I'll put you at the head of our next caravan. 
Gazlowe wants you to dig up his buried treasure from atop the cliffs overlooking Ratchet.	Gazlowe's Fortune	Sink me, you were right! There's a map tattooed on the skull. That cursed Baron - he buried my treasure right under my nose. Or, above my head, anyway. The map points to a place on the bluffs over Ratchet, to the south. Follow the road west out of the city, get atop the hill, head south, then run back towards the coast and look for an enormous tree overlooking the bay. Fetch my treasure and I'll split it with you! 
Board Horton Hornblower's Riverboat northeast of Ratchet and get a riverboat ride to Nozzlepot's Outpost.	Raging River Ride	Enjoy your cut of the loot, George! I hate to share, but business is business. And that double-dealer Nozzlepot is guaranteed a 10% cut of this treasure. Can you deliver this to him at his outpost in the north? He's got a little research station upstream, along the river. If you travel just northeast of town here, Horton Hornblower can give you a free ride on one of his riverboats. Tell him I sent ya! 
Free 12 Highperch Pridelings.	Free the Pridelings	The trappers are rounding up all of the young wind riders. George, will you go out there and free the pridelings? 
Slay Overseer Gorthak and any other 12 Horde at the Warsong Lumber Camp.	Agents of Destruction	The Warsong Lumber Camp is a blight upon an embattled landscape. Every time we make progress in halting their operations, Overseer Gorthak orders his loggers to redouble their efforts! Now, the orcs are cutting more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees! This is an affront to all we stand for, George, and we will show them that we'll not suffer further destruction of our lands! Go, and do not rest until Overseer Gorthak and his minions are dead! 
Speak with Kazak Darkscream at The Barracks in Orgrimmar.	Meet with Kazak Darkscream	I have just received word from Kazak Darkscream, Orgrimmar's foremost warlock trainer. He wishes you to travel to Orgrimmar and speak with him at The Barracks in the Valley of Honor. It sounds like he has an important mission for you. 
Speak with Adarrah in Thistleshrub Valley in western Tanaris.	Warchief's Command: Uldum!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Adarrah at the Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris. Ancient texts tell us that Uldum is home to untold riches and treasures beyond compare. Go forth and claim these in the name of the Horde! You can reach Adarrah's caravan by traveling to the southwestern part of Tanaris and looking for her in Thistleshrub Valley. Destiny calls! 
Use the Signal Flares at the Temple of Uldum.	Three if by Air	I had planned on bringing the coffer back to my lab for study, but it seems Brann here has different ideas. He thinks he knows how to put a stop to Deathwing's plans here in Uldum. My buddy, Jock, is standing by with the transport, just waiting for our signal. Take these flares and plant them around the perimeter to let him know that we're ready. 
Destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia.	The Brood of Onyxia	Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch. Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them. We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground. As for Mok'Morokk... I have other plans for the sod. 
Obtain 8 Bone Staff Fragments.	The Flameseer's Staff	A powerful artifact known as the Flameseer's Staff was lost during the initial onslaught by the enemy forces. It was an ancient bone staff that granted its wielder power over the elements of fire. Its fragments litter the area around us. Find them and bring them to Malfurion. Perhaps the artifact's power will still be of use. 
Talk to Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex in Darkshore.	Sworn to Protect	My duty here has been fulfilled as best it can. Send word to Malfurion that I'll be joining him soon. Good luck to you, George. Good luck to all of us. 
Speak with Nafien at Timbermaw Hold in Felwood. Timbermaw Hold is to the east, past Felpaw Village.	Timbermaw Hold	Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask. While I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us. I just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done. 
Talk to Warlord Bloodhilt, then ride into Desolation Hold and inform Gar'dul that Warlord Bloodhilt is on his way.	Desolation Hold Inspection	Thanks to you, the immediate threat is over. But my work here in the Barrens is only beginning. Honor's Stand was captured and Taurajo was sacked while Warlord Gar'dul was in charge of the region. The Warchief has sent me here to clean up his mess. I would like you to ride into Desolation Hold to the south in advance of me and let Gar'dul know that it is time for a reckoning. Talk to me when you are ready to leave and I will assemble my vanguard to accompany you. 
Bring your cub near snow-covered burrows in northern Winterspring 5 times to help it learn how to hunt arctic hares.	Hunting Practice	Your Winterspring cub paws playfully at your hands. Without any playmates, the cub has few chances to practice its hunting skills. Perhaps you should take your cub hunting for the small arctic hares that burrow in the snow of northern Winterspring. Bring your cub close to the mounds of snow covering the hare burrows and wait for the cub's instincts to take over. 
Slay 30 Demonic Invaders.	The Last Stand	George, I desperately need your help! I cannot hold out forever against this demonic onslaught. If I fall, Astranaar is next! Please help me! 
Burn Stacks of Hay inside the Lost City of the Tol'vir in Uldum.	Smoke in Their Eyes	I'm not sure what knuckle-headed plan your friend is concocting, but we're going to need a distraction if we're to stand a chance of escaping. Take the torch from that brazier and go start some fires. Perhaps if we divert the Neferset scum's attention away for a few minutes, we'll have the opportunity we need. 
Bring a Shaman Voodoo Charm to Oben Rageclaw in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den.	The Sleeping Druid	The Gnarlpine shaman that inhabit this place have discovered a way of separating a sleeping druid's spirit from the physical body. The furbolg have animated my physical form and are using it to attack anyone that attempts to explore the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. I am now trapped in the Emerald Dream, powerless to stop this. You must help me. The Gnarlpine shaman carry a strange charm which is used to perform this ritual, and I'd like to examine it. Please, George, bring one to me. 
Rescue Cynthia, Ashley and James in the Hammond Farmstead.	Save the Children!	The military will not allow me outside the cellar, but my children are still in my farm! Please, you must go find them. The Forsaken have no regard for innocent life -- my kids are in great danger! Their names are Cynthia, Ashley and James. If you find them, bring them back here. I'll be forever in your debt. 
Slay 15 of any demon type at Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon, or Demon Fall Ridge.	Destroy the Legion	The remains of the demonic Burning Legion have been a thorn in our side for far too long! No more! The demons are attacking from the areas known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge to the east. Go and destroy as many as you can to bring glory to both yourself and the Horde! 
Inspect the Rattle of Bones on Darkcloud Pinnacle in Thousand Needles.	What's that Rattle?	Did you see that glowing rattle on the ground outside of Isha's hut? 
Accompany Harrison Jones in the Chamber of the Moon.	Bad Datas	There should be two titan communication devices in this chamber. If my translations are correct, one is a death trap and the other will accept the codes and activate the obelisk. Let's hope I get this right. Let me know when you're ready. 
Kill Bigfist.	Sasquatch Sighting	You may have seen this with your own eyes, but my longrunners have reported something disturbing to me. The gordunni in the hills have captured an enormous sasquatch from the wilds. I don't know how long it's been held, but ogres are not ones for hobbies. I fear they plan to unleash the tortured beast on Camp Mojache. Return to the deepest corner of the Gordunni Outpost and slay the sasquatch, George. 
Speak with Laina Nightsky near the Grove of Aessina in Hyjal.	The Fires of Mount Hyjal	Do you see it, George? From the ridge southwest of here... plumes of black smoke curling into the sky. Mount Hyjal is burning. If the fires have raced this far up the mountain, surely they threaten the Grove of Aessina and all of our forces there. Can you investigate? Speak with Laina Nightsky near the Grove of Aessina. Last I heard, she was fighting off the assault. 
Test the Lifebringer Sapling on any nearby healthy Grizzled Thistle Bear, Whitetail Stag, or Moonstalker Matriarch/Sire.	An Ounce of Prevention	Are you familiar with the Old Ones, George? Onu and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring Darkshore. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife. Here, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens! 
Speak with Pozzik at Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge in Thousand Needles.	Two If By Boat	Are you ready to go, Mechanic? One of our braves will row you out to the Mirage Raceway. If anyone has survived out there, they'll desperately need your help. May the Earth Mother smile upon you. 
Find Synge at the Southsea Holdfast in Thousand Needles.	Where's Synge?	Hey, George, you haven't seen our gunsmith, Synge, have you? I just know that the pirates captured him! He said that he was going to try to sell them some rifles, or something. Would you please look for him up at the Southsea Holdfast to the east? I'll bet that no-good gnome he's always traveling with, Wizzle Brassbolts, got him into trouble! 
Obtain the Sultan's Staff, then use the Elaborate Disc to create the Shaft of the Stars.	A Strange Disc	The etching around the surface of this object indicates that it is of ancient origins, and yet no signs of wear can be detected. A hole on its edge, full of splintered wood, indicates that it is meant to be put atop a wooden staff of some sort. Before showing this to Doctor Jones, you should find the other piece. 
Use the Orb of Ascension and answer 10 answers correctly.	Mental Training: Speaking the Truth to Power	You might think you're ready to receive the knowledge we're to impart on you. But you are not. Think of your mind as a box inside a series of other boxes. Each step of our training will open one of those boxes, until you are ready to achieve direct communion with the elements. Take the Core of Ascension and answer all questions it asks of you, truthfully. Failing to do so could be... fatal. 
Report to Huntress Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale.	The Front Line	Their forces are weakened, their supplies destroyed, and their subleaders are dead. It is time for us to take this fight to their home, and their leader. I'm admittedly still in the dark as to what spurred their sudden aggression, but perhaps we will find some answers on their doorstep. Take this arrow that Balthule prepared and report to Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale to join the attack. It would be best to secure a ride on one of our nightsabers - going on foot would be dangerous. 
Speak to Sorata Firespinner at the Northern Rocketway Exchange.	Wash Out	Delicious! Azy always trying to get his hands on magic artifacts. Said he was trying to make friends with that archmage person. Xylem! Xylem has LOTS of apprentices. Takes in all kinds, burns'm out, leaves them wandering all over. High turnover. Last one was last night. Headed over towards that big goblin tower construction thing, way west. Maybe he'll help you meet Xylem? Maybe Xylem knows where Azy is? Play nice! 
Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces.	Void Incubation	Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive. It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment, yes? No? Oh...In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some. 
Kill 10 Ironwood Buzzers to feed the Seedling Protector.	Buzzers for Baby	<The tiny seedling opens its leaves wide, like a baby bird waiting to be fed. It speaks in a very faint voice:>Hungry... want... bugs...<You can hear the buzzing of wasps to the south. Could they be what the little thing wants to feed on?> 
Defend yourself.	Is This Justice?	He was a good boy, George. Young, loving. He would have never killed any of the young druids. They were his friends! No... Not Orthus. The General must be called to answer for this crime. I will have justice! 
Use the Wildmane Cleansing Totem at the Wildmane Water Well.	Wildmane Cleansing	Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young George. The Wildmane Totem is made, and your last task lies ahead. The Wildmane Water Well lies north of Thunder Bluff. Perform the ritual! Heal the land of the Grimtotem's poisons! Let clean water flow once again! 
Travel to Feralas and speak with Telaron Windflight at Dreamer's Rest.	The Wilds of Feralas	You are truly brave to help us protect these lands, hero. If you wish to do more for the wilds, there are others in need of your aid. The verdant forests of Feralas lie to the south. There, in the shade of the mighty Twin Colossals, you must seek out Telaron Windflight. At Dreamer's Rest, he and his fellow druids of the talon have found signs of a disturbing illness. They will need your help, Mechanic. Go in peace. 
Return to Ysera at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal.	The Ancients are With Us	Nemesis... destroyed. I feel rejuvenated. Powerful. Awakened. Tell Ysera my strength is hers. The Twilight's Hammer will fall. 
Speak to Melithar Staghelm in Shadowglen.	A Favor for Melithar	You should speak with Melithar. I believe he had some troubles with the grell already. I expect he can offer you a well needed place to store more of your goods should you aid him. 
Slay Prince Xavalis.	The Demon Prince	The Jadefire satyr that have overrun so much of Felwood work directly with the Shadow Council. These satyr answer directly to the ancient and powerful Prince Xavalis. Some say he is the son of Xavius, the first satyr, blessed by Sargeras himself. Whatever his nature, he must die if we are to scatter the Jadefire and reclaim our barrow dens. Journey deep into Shadow Hold and slay him. Show him no mercy; he will have none for you. 
Find Hana'zua in the Valley of Trials.	Hana'zua	Hey mon, take a knee and hear me out. We got a problem. A good friend of mine, Hana'zua, has gone out into the valley and he hasn't returned. Last I seen, he was headin' north, where the scorpids hunt. Maybe you go take a look for him? The spirits be tellin' me that he's not well. 
Speak with Onatay at Hunter's Hill in Southern Barrens.	Holdout at Hunter's Hill	Honor's Stand may have been lost, but its spirit was never crushed. Even now survivors are holding out at a point called ""Hunter's Hill.""Continue following the high road and you will find our camp just up ahead. Speak with Onatay when you get there and let her know the trail is, for the moment, still clear. 
Retrieve Drizle's Key from Chieftain Bloodmaw.	The Chieftain's Key	Sniff... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get caught! They grabbed me and put this chain on me and left me here! I can't move and my leg fell asleep and I'm hungry! The chief has the key... Chieftain Bloodmaw, the other ones said. He's in the north end of the camp. But hurry! Please! Don't leave me alone here! 
Speak with Denmother Ulrica at Talonbranch Glade.	Report to the Denmother	With the goblins scattered and their equipment destroyed, they'll either get the message and leave, or be easy pickings if they choose to stay. We've won here. You've fought as fiercely as any member of the pack, George. Return to the Denmother and let her know of our success. I'll be maintaining my watch. 
Collect 16 Satyr Horns for Pixel in Splintertree Post.	Satyr Horns	Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days. After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs... but you look like you might be! Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time. 
Speak with Ajamon Ghostcaller at the Southsea Holdfast in Thousand Needles.	Haunted	You think I'm going to just let you go after you killed me like that, mon? No way! I didn't create a piratical mercantile empire out of nothing just to see you bring me down. You're going to help me get back to life. Find my ex-wife, Ajamon, on the north side of the Holdfast. Just follow your nose. She'll be wherever the stinky brewing cauldron is. 
Take the Grand Tablet to Gunstan.	The Grand Tablet	At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing. While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Gunstan would probably like to see this. 
Obtain 10 Discarded Supplies.	Marshal's Refuse	A big part of making money is shamelessness. You have to be willing to profit off of the misfortune of others. It all ends up boiling down to one question: How much do you love money? When Marshal and his crew abandoned their refuge up to the north, they left behind lots of supplies. This stuff isn't rare, or even particularly valuable, but it's there if you're willing to take it. His camp is up in the cliffs, to the north. Oh, and be on the lookout for whatever it was that made them leave... 
Return to Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore.	Return to Jaina	We must make plans to destroy the remnants of the Defias. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore. She has ever been a loyal friend and steadfast ally. Go to the Mage Quarter at the western end of the city and speak with Archmage Malin at the foot of the tower there. He will speed your return to Theramore. 
Kill Okrog outside the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal.	Speech Writing for Dummies	Listen, George. I found out what they're doing with Jarod Shadowsong. He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the ogres of the Twilight's Hammer as part of this year's initiation. I heard that the initiate charged with delivering the speech ahead of the sacrifice is an ogre named Okrog, but get this: you were a close second. We need you to deliver that speech if we're to free Jarod. Don't worry -- I'll write you some cue cards -- just make sure Okrog has an ""accident"" as he leaves the Seat of the Chosen. 
Use the Charred Branch within The Inferno to Summon Thol'embaar. Kill him and take the Black Heart of Thol'embaar.	Black Heart of Flame	Now you will use our newfound knowledge to pull Thol'embaar into the mortal plane like a babe screaming from the womb. Then you will crush him. The ritual is simple: take this charred branch, tap it on the ground three times, and utter his name aloud. You must call him from within the heart of the Inferno. Destroy him, and bring his black heart back to me. 
Kill 10 Enraged Ravagers and return to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest.	Cutting a Path	During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. Scout Loryi has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to Blood Watch. The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return. As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by ravagers. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely. 
Defeat Orno Grimtotem at Stonetalon Pass.	War Dance	Some see our people as gentle giants, or noble savages. They have never seen us fight against our own kind...against betrayers from within. The Grimtotem were offered mercy in exile, and they have scarred their own home to spite us. They will no longer be tolerated in Mulgore. I've already sent our warriors ahead to drive them out through Stonetalon Pass, to the north. You have fought bravely against the Grimtotem, George; I ask that you join the battle again. Go, and help deal this final blow. 
Slay 4 Rageroar Lieutenants and acquire Rageroar's Helm by killing Karga Rageroar.	Silencing Rageroar	I have encountered the Rageroar clan before, George. They are led not by an orc, but by a monster - a war-gorged fiend without a shred of decency or compassion. He and his lieutenants must be killed, not just to save Northwatch, but for the good of all of Azeroth. Karga Rageroar wears a helm. Execute him, Mechanic, and bring the helm to me. It is of ... particular importance. Rageroar has made his camp across the chasm, east of here. 
Report to Vol'jin at Darkspear Hold.	More Than Expected	Ya definitely more den expected, mon. I'm sure dere's more important stuff we can be usin' ya talents on now. Ya don't need ta hang out with da newbloods no more. Head down to da village to da southeast and make yaself known. Lend a hand here and there and I'm sure ya make yer way up to sometin' more prestigious quick enough. 
The tracks lead to the east side of Thorn Hill. Follow them and see what you find.	To Track a Thief	Animal tracks surround the wreckage, tracks made by enormous curved claws. They appear to be raptor tracks. Your first instinct is that raptor-riders assaulted the caravan, but the impressions aren't deep and there are no non-animal tracks to be seen. The tracks head northeast of here toward the east side of Thorn Hill. The answer to this mystery must lie in its shadow. 
Slay 20 Grimtotem Tauren at Darkcloud Pinnacle.	Darkcloud Grimtotem	There's no way around it. If you want to win a battle, you have to spill some blood. In this case... a lot of it. You know what we have to do. 
Report to Garl Stormclaw at the entrance to Un'Goro Crater.	Finding Stormclaw	Zen'Aliri been studyin' the ways of the druid, Human. Hopefully one day, Zen'Aliri join the Druids of the Talon, and soar over this crater as a storm crow. But for now, my mentor says I stay here and wait. So Zen'Aliri waits. I know another druid who might be able to use your help. His name is Garl Stormclaw, and he's somewhere to the east of here, studying reagents. Maybe you go talk to him? 
Aonar at Kessel's Crossing wants you to bring him 10 Sand Pears.	A Favorite Treat	I've made a wonderful discovery, Mechanic. On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees. I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share! 
Deliver the Bag of Bathran's Hair to Orendil Broadleaf at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale.	Delivery for Orendil	Quickly, George. I will put the Bathran's Hair into this bag, but you must deliver it to my master, Orendil Broadleaf. You will find him at Maestra's Post, just south down the road on the left. But beware, we've received reports that the post is under attack from the Horde! 
Extinguish 15 fires.	Astranaar's Burning!	Mechanic, Astranaar's burning! Quickly, take this bucket of water and put out the fires before there's nothing left! 
Collect Gargantapid's Stinger.	Gargantapid	No! It didn't work! I don't know what to do, unless...Oh gosh, it's worse than I thought! She must've been stung by the one lurking in the cave. I saw it the first night we arrived. Claws the size of a goblin. A tail as tall as a tree! We shared hushed whispers of it around the campfire... we called it... GARGANTAPID! ...hey, are you laughing? Stop that! This is serious! Chelsea's life is on the line! Please, I'll make it worth your while...just bring me Gargantapid's poison gland! 
Slay Elder Stormhoof.	Grimtotem Chiefs: Elder Stormhoof	Elder Stormhoof is a shaman chief of immense power. He was taught by Magatha Grimtotem, the Elder Crone, leader of the Grimtotem clan. We know that he is here and that he has been training their geomancers. We have to kill him, Mechanic. 
Speak to Maximillian of Northshire to learn more about becoming a squire.	An Important Lesson	What ho, traveler! You must know that you set foot upon the camp of Maximillian of Northshire! Mayhap you have heard tales sung of my many exploits? I can see from the look in your eye that you have. That glint of recognition plays upon your visage like the White Lady's reflection o'er Stonecairne Lake. It is clear to me that you seek adventure. As you seem able enough, and thoroughly well-intentioned, I would offer to make you my squire. 
Speak with Fizzle Brassbolts on Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge in Thousand Needles.	Spread the Word	For rendering me faithful service, I grant you your life. Take it and be gone from my sight. Let your people know of all that has transpired. And George, if we ever cross paths again, you will die. 
Slay Rhoho, Sherik, and Jorreth.	Three Princes	The Gelkis reside in southwest Desolace. They are just as stubborn as the Magram, and since they have not suffered war and relocation, they are considerably stronger. Humbling the Gelkis will require an extreme show of force. Khan Shodo and his three sons rule the clan. Shodo is aging, and suffers from old war wounds. He never leaves the depths of his cave. The strength of his rule lies in his sons. Slay them, and persuade the Khan to commit to our cause. 
Travel through the flamegate in the center of the Flamewake in Mount Hyjal. Speak with Farden Talonshrike once you are inside.	The Hatchery Must Burn	George! Choluna spoke true: the goddess has returned! A miracle in our midst. While you were able to kill the twilight dragon Sethria, we have not yet located all of the eggs that the harpies had delivered to her. Thisalee and I have tracked them to a great hatchery constructed within the Firelands. It is not of this realm, so Aviana cannot accompany you. Fly south and enter the flamegate in the center of the valley. Farden Talonshrike has been sent ahead and will be waiting for you within. 
Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to capture Matis the Cruel.	Matis the Cruel	Matis will be brought to justice, George; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate. Scour the island for this bastard. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my trackers see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured. 
Kill 12 Raging Earth Elementals.	Between a Rock and a Hard Place	Dontrag can explain it better than me. Basically, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Can't do anything down here due to all of the things that can kill us and can't go back to the base due to all of the things that can kill us - you know? Perhaps if we worked together we might be able to get this mess sorted out. How about you get started by clearing out some of these elementals that have apparently killed everything in the mine, ok? 
Collect 10 Theramore Medals from Theramore Marines and Deck Hands. Kill Lieutenants Pyre and Buckland.	A Captain's Vengeance	Yet another ship from my fleet has been lost to those overzealous humans from Theramore! Their new Rear Admiral has parked himself right off the coast here. He's boarding or sinking any vessel that doesn't heave-to at his whim. Travel south along the Merchant Coast to his camp. Bring me the medals of the marines and deck hands. Execute his top Lieutenants, Pyre and Buckland. Lay waste to them as they have laid waste to my fleet! 
Kill 10 SI:7 Operatives in Silithus.	No Spies Allowed	Hey George, I'm glad you're here. I'm in way over my head! Killer bugs, a strange substance... that GIANT sword sticking outta the ground... I don't have a good feelin' about this place! To make matters worse, I've been gettin' reports of Alliance spies snoopin' around the camp! Look kid, the Dark Lady has plans for this mysterious ore and I ain't going to be the one to dissapoint her, know what I mean? Get over to the mining camp and take out those SI:7 spies before they ruin the whole operation! 
Collect 7 Suspended Starlight.	By the Light of the Stars	Look at this, George.<Harrison holds up the dead scout's goggles.>I tightened the clamp in the middle and crimped the wires on the edges. They may not be the most comfortable, but they should hold together. If I've translated your tablets correctly, there's something hidden here - a final piece to our puzzle. I hope your spectacles hold the key. Let me know what you find! 
Slay 6 Crazed Diggers and Mekgineer Mixeltweed.	The Curse of the Tombs	The Neferset are not the only threat to our sacred tombs. A gnomish expedition stumbled upon our lands a few weeks ago. They did not heed our warnings and dug too deep within a cursed vault. Their entire expedition is now afflicted by a terrible curse that has robbed them of their sanity and taken control of their minds. They now seek access to the deepest vaults of Uldum and pose a great threat. Go to the Sunstone Terrace and put their wretched souls out of their misery. 
Find A-Me 01 at Fungal Rock.	Chasing A-Me 01	Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions. You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes? Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01. She has been studying the local wildlife at Fungal Rock for several months, but she should have returned by now. I fear the worst for her. Can you help me find her? 
Speak to Condenna the Pitiless at the Training Grounds in Hyjal.	Your New Identity	There. Not my best work, but certainly not my worst. You will be known as ""Georgedamus"" among the cultists. These papers will bump you ahead of the other recruits and allow you to speak directly to the Twilight instructors. Go to the proving grounds and show these to Condenna the Pitiless. She's separating the wheat from the chaff. Show her what you're made of. 
Khan Kammah wants you to speak to Khan Leh'prah.	My Word is My Bond	It would seem that we have no choice. As reluctant as I am to cooperate with the Kolkar, there is wisdom in the words of their Khan. You may give him my word that we shall lend our spears to the battle. 
Kherrah wants you to speak with Khan Leh'prah.	Time For Change	<Kherrah listens to you as you explain recent events.>I agree with the words of the Kolkar Khan. The time for ancient grudges is over. It is a shame that it has taken a demonic crisis to unite the tribes. I shall return to my father and convince him to join your cause. You have my word that he will comply. Return to Khan Leh'prah and inform him that the Gelkis will be ready when called upon. 
Speak with the Kaldorei Spirit at Lake Kel'theril in Winterspring.	The Ruins of Kel'Theril	At this lake, the Crystal of Zin-Malor was stolen by the Highborne. The crystal was a powerful artifact that bent arcane magic in wild and unpredictable ways... but it could only be held by the worthy, and brought doom upon all others. The spirits that wander here span generations, each shackled here by Zin-Malor. Some will speak and tell their fates. Should you wish to learn the fate of Zin-Malor, seek the spirit at the center of the lake... 
Kill 6 Hecklefang Scavengers.	Keeping the Dogs at Bay	Not everyone who fled Taurajo was able to make it to Una'fe, George. Some died of wounds along the way. Others were jumped by opportunistic quilboar. I'll take care of the grim task of finding and gathering the bodies. But there is something you can do for me. Hecklefang scavengers prowl the lands south of here and are savaging the corpses, tearing at their bowels and dragging away the limbs of the dead. Please, thin their numbers so that I can perform the proper funerary rites. 
Go to the Battlescar. Scout out the flag marker and kill 10 Desolation Raiders. Capturing the flag will give all Alliance players in the scar a combat advantage.	Claim the Battlescar	The Horde has fought us to a standstill from their stronghold west of here. The fighting continues, even as the land breaks open under our feet. Someone's got to break the stalemate! I need you to venture into the Battlescar and help my men crush the Horde opposition there. In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls the area. Scout out the flag. It'll be worth your while to claim the scar for the Alliance if someone hasn't already done so. 
Use Gnarl's Bough to close 10 Demon Gates.	Closure is Only Natural	Through the ground I can feel more demons being brought into our world. Soon there will be too many and we will be overrun without hope of turning them back. Take this piece of me and return to Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge, south of Felfire Hill. Aim the bough at a demon gate and concentrate. I have stored a portion of the forest's life force in its wood, and it will close the gate. 
Slay 15 Splithoof Heights centaurs.	Eminent Domain	It is our destiny to take this oil. Unfortunate that the centaur retreated to here when the sea rushed in. Unfortunate for them, that is. They've spit in our faces, George. We made them a generous offer and they made the mistake of not accepting. Now we... you, will show them the error of their ways. Clear the centaur off of the Splithoof Heights. The oil must flow! 
Slay any 12 demons at Fire Scar Shrine.	Clear the Shrine	An end must be put to the Burning Legion's evil! George, you have defeated one of their most powerful, but there are still multitudes of demons infesting the woods to the east in Fire Scar Shrine. As a friend of the forest, will you slay these foul creatures and then warn Big Baobob, the great ancient of war at the Shrine of Aessina to the northeast? 
Korrah wants you to speak to her when you are ready to be shown the Naga threat.	The Emerging Threat	I am all that remains of my company, sent to monitor the many changes on this coast of Desolace. I have reported of the dramatic increase of naga here, but to no effect. My peers are focused on other crises, so I must ask you, a stranger, to assist me in my research. First, though, allow me to show you the threat we face. 
Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.	Seek Out Tabetha	The arms you captured in Blackhoof Village have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the Grimtotems who destroyed the Shady Rest are still at large. To the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a human, she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages. Ask her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The Alliance must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack. 
Collect 8 Wyrmtail stalks in the Dragonmurk or Wyrmbog.	Catch a Dragon by the Tail	With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages. We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply. It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them. 
Speak to Elder Brownpaw at the Blackwood Camp southwest of the Eye of the Vortex.	The Land Is in Their Blood	If we're to stabilize the forces of nature, we'll need every little bit of help we can get. The furbolg of the Blackwood tribe have long inhabited the area and have strong ties to the land. Their elder Shaman, Elder Brownpaw, wields great power over the elements -- his assistance would be invaluable. See if you can obtain their aid. 
Speak to Archaeologist Groff at Remtravel's Excavation.	Unearthed Knowledge	Listen, George. We need to learn more about what we're up against. To the southwest, beyond the Master's Glaive, there is a group of dwarven prospectors who were excavating the nearby ruins. Perhaps they have uncovered knowledge that is useful to us in this matter. 
Slay 12 Jadefire Shifters in Jadefire Run.	Deceivers In Our Midst	Now that you've had a lesson in keeping an open mind, perhaps you'd like to learn WHY I killed those druids. The answer is simple: They are not druids at all. Demons still roam the ruins, now hiding in plain sight in the guise of friendly caretakers. See for yourself...this blindfold is soaked in demon blood. Take it north up the hills to Jadefire Run and place it on your eyes. It will show even the most oblivious fool the true nature of any demon. 
	The Path of the Protector	 
Give Kargal Battlescar at the Barrens outpost your recruitment letter.	Conscript of the Horde	Hmm, you look pretty strong. Listen, my good friend Kargal needs some new recruits for Barrens duty. I know you want to do what's right for the Horde. Well, this is your chance. Take this recruitment letter to Kargal and see if he'll sign it. 
Use your Spectral Sight.	Second Sight	Sylvanas becoming Warchief may be problematic. In life she was a proud ranger, known to many in our ranks. But since the Scourge took her, some of her own allies do not trust the Banshee Queen. The Legion will strike at the first hint of dissension. Even now, I sense something amiss, George. I fear that not all is as it seems. Quickly, use your Spectral Sight. We must know if there are foes among us! 
Retreive 5 Mossy Tumors.	Mossy Tumors	There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings. We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep Teldrassil safe we must cut down the timberlings who are beyond help. Those that wander Wellspring Lake to the north are the most tainted. They must be removed! Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them. Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned. 
Escort Sentinel Aynasha to safety.	Timely Arrival	It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome. I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here. Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel. 
Use the Frostgale Crystal to extinguish the flames on 4 Immolated Supplicants.	Waste of Flesh	Look at these fools. Half of them won't even make it past this trial. They are not worthy of ascending into our inner circles. But perhaps... perhaps they are worthy of menial service. Take this gem and utilize its power to save some of the less competent supplicants. Those who have no chance of succeeding. Those already on fire, preferably. 
Maurin Bonesplitter wants you to collect 3 Hollow Kodo Horns from Dying Kodo.	Delivery Device	As fate would have it, there's a special deed that needs doing - one that will benefit the Cenarion Circle as well as myself. You see, Mechanic, I am under pressure to create a special... concoction, shall we say. I believe my work to be complete, but I need to have it tested to be certain. The target of this test is to be the naga, who threaten this region from the west. Their demise would surely aid the Circle. First though, I need a delivery device. Hollow horns from the dying kodo should do nicely. 
Witch Doctor Uzer'i wants you to wait for a moment while he prepares the weapons.	Weapons of Spirit	Imbuing the muisek into the weapons is a difficult process. Now that I have all of the required materials and the muisek of the creatures that you captured, I may begin. Please wait; I will return in a moment. 
Recover Brendol's Satchel.	Hunting Brendol	I'm too busy collectin' artifacts to busy myself with much else, but there is a bit of an issue here I wouldn't mind sortin' out. There's a forsaken apothecary who's been pokin' around these parts for a while now. Normally, I'd ignore him, but three times now he's snuck into my camp and pilfered my supplies.... enough's enough! Find the thief and bring me whatever's left o' my things! 
Disable the two Rods of Subjugation that bind Tortolla.	Breaking the Bonds	From the deep...A realm of darkness and fire. Grasping in my slumber. I am ensnared, Human. Shadows lurk in the rods of fire beside me. Slay them. That I may be free again. 
Slay Xavathras.	Break the Unbreakable	With the claw, we are ready to break through the Jadefire's defenses. Head into the ruins to the northwest. Beyond the frontline of the satyr you'll find a narrow pass heading to their corrupted moonwell. An enormous wall of demonic flame bars the path, but the Claw of Tichondrius should be able to dispel it. Beyond the barrier you will find the leader of these forces, Xavathras, guarding the corrupted moonwell. Slay him once you are through! 
Deliver the Roadway Plans to Kilrok Gorehammer at Hunter's Hill in Southern Barrens.	The Low Road	This bundle of papers was found in a leather satchel hidden under the officer's clothes. Battle maps of the region depict Honor's Stand, connected to what appears to be a large unfinished roadway crossing the Barrens all the way from Theramore. It looks like the Alliance plans to build a road from the coast straight into the heart of Kalimdor! Kilrok Gorehammer will want to see this. 
Use Soothing Seeds on 6 Deviate Terrortooths or Deviate Plainstriders and observe the results.	Sowing a Solution	Based on what you've brought me, I think we may have a solution. I've imbued the lashvine seeds with healing energies. Simple contact with these should imbue the creatures here with enough energy to force out the corrupted influence. Go and attempt to heal the mutated raptors and plainstriders by sprinkling the seeds on them, and report the results back to me. 
Collect 7 Steamwheedle Supplies.	Seaside Salvage	If we want to convince Mister Noggenfogger to let us move more gnomes here, we've got to show him just how nice we are! I know just the thing. Gadgetzan's under blockade by pirates, but plenty of the goods that get blown off the ships survive intact... they just wash away. Most of them wash up in the shallows just south of town. If you could go collect those supplies for them, it'd help us make friends! And it'll keep that mean goblin girl over there from taking them and selling them. 
Talk to Rocco Whipshank at Grol'dom Farm and escort his caravan all the way to the Crossroads.	Crossroads Caravan Delivery	<Rocco hands you a familiar-looking shotgun.>I took the liberty of cleaning up Halga's artillery for you. I'm sure I don't need to warn you about the kickback. Just ask me when you're ready to mount up for the Crossroads! Thork is waiting for you there. Be sure not to give him any lip. Don't stop for nothing, George, and if someone gets too close, just give 'em a thump with the butt-end of your gun. Do us proud! 
Slay Isha Gloomaxe.	Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe	Sentinel training 101: take out their leaders and your enemy's forces will soon fall apart. We're going to do just that, Mechanic. Isha Gloomaxe is the closest of the Grimtotem chiefs. Let's see if we can't take her measure. 
Slay Arnak Grimtotem.	Grimtotem Chiefs: The Chief of Chiefs	And now the time has come to take out the leader of all of the Darkcloud Pinnacle Grimtotem: Arnak Grimtotem. It is said that he's the disgraced nephew of Magatha Grimtotem, the Elder Crone and matriarch of the Grimtotem clan. Supposedly, his indiscretions have left him in a state of disfavor with her. But none of that matters right now. All that matters is that we kill him. For good this time. 
Go to the Neferset Prison Camp and find the whereabouts of Tahet.	Neferset Prison	Hieroglyphs depicting a chained Tol'vir mark the southeastern corner of the map. Perhaps Tahet was brought there when he was imprisoned. 
Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore.	... and Bugs	Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab. And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect! The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs. An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish. Head on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs! 
Bring 4 Light Leather and 4 Coarse Thread to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff.	Kodo Hide Bag	The kodo beasts of Mulgore are strong and sturdy -- traits much respected among us. If you are skilled in leatherworking and wish the knowledge to make a Kodo Hide Bag, then bring me supplies for my trade. Do this, and I will share my knowledge with you. 
Collect a Charged Condenser Jar from a Twilight Lightning Channel.	Lightning in a Bottle	Lo'Gosh granted me a vision while you were in the hovel, George. I saw you striding across the Lightning Ledge, with lightning bolts in your hand. The vision was powerful: Lo'Gosh feels this is of utmost importance. We must not fail the ancient. Upon the Lightning Ledge, Twilight's Hammer has been experimenting with devices they call ""Lightning Channels.""Investigate one of these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Lo'Gosh and learn what the ancient is planning... 
Use Maurin's Concoction to kill 10 Slitherblade Invaders, 10 Slitherblade Sirens, and 3 Sea Giants.	Cleansing Our Crevasse	I recognize this foul creation. It's a terrible disease that kills almost instantly, and in a most violent manner. Loathe as I am to employ such devices, I fear we have no choice here. As you of course know, the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea! When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault. Use the concoction on the naga and their allies to make Desolace safe! 
Acquire 5 crates of Confiscated Arms from Honor's Stand and re-equip 5 Stonetalon Prisoners. Use the nearby ropes to quickly sneak in and out of the Alliance camp.	Warriors' Redemption	Those that surrendered when Honor's Stand fell are no longer worthy of our Horde, Mechanic. But I'm not giving up on them yet. The prison tower below us is lightly guarded. Let's give those prisoners one final chance to die with honor. I've set up ropes that will allow you to quickly clamber up and down the mountain. Slip down, acquire the confiscated weapons, and re-arm the prisoners inside the tower. And George, stay by the tower! We're not yet equipped for an assault on the base proper. 
	More Beads for Salfa	 
Collect 10 pieces of Fresh-Cut Frostwood from Frostleaf Treants.	Chop Chop	I deal in small timber plenty, but full trees? That's a novelty item. Kinda like those boulders. Maybe you can do me another favor. Just west of town there's a grove of trees overlooking Lake Kel'theril. I don't know if it's the spooks there, or all that elf magic junk strewn around the place, but we've been getting treants and lashers wandering around there recently. They're making it a real pain to chop wood over there, so why don't you chop some of them? Bring the wood from the treants back here. 
Collect 6 pieces of Hyena Meat.	Chicken of the Desert	I've got an idea, but we're going to need bait. The other day I saw a rabid blisterpaw hyena wander too close to the edge of the chasm, and one of the silithid comes diving out of nowhere. Nearly swallowed it whole! Horrible sight. So we're gonna need hyena meat, obviously. Go gather some, make sure it's fresh, and bring it back here. There should be plenty just north of the camp. 
Go to the northeastern source of the Vir'naal River and slay Scalemother Hevna.	The Root of the Corruption	You might have dealt with the symptoms of our problem, George. But I've been studying these foul beasts and the eggs are not laid here by them. The stream from the current carries their eggs to the dam, but whatever is laying them will be found upstream. Go northeast, to the river's main source, and deal with the root of the corruption. 
Help Salhet slay 8 Bloodsnarl Hyenas.	Shaping Up	High Commander Kamses has a special mission for me? Wait... don't tell me. It's hyenas again, right? Very well, I shall do my best. Meet with me at the Sunwatcher's Ridge. I won't disappoint you. 
Retrieve the Emerald Dreamcatcher.	The Emerald Dreamcatcher	I was once given an emerald dreamcatcher from Gaerolas Talvethen, the warden of the druids in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it. Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village... Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there. Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, Mechanic? 
Speak to King Phaoris at Ramkahen in Uldum.	The High Council's Decision	The High Council is ready to decide on the war with the Neferset tribe. 
Deliver Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm to Alysra at the entrance of the Barrow Dens in Hyjal.	Through the Dream	Alysra's plan might be necessary, George. I don't know how much longer we can hold off the cultists. Fandral Staghelm is bound by powerful spells. He won't be able to escape you, even inside the Emerald Dream. Beware, though, for all we know the nightmare has spread to this part of the world inside the dream. Take Fandral to the surface and hand him to Alysra. Let us hope he's more secure in Moonglade than he is here. 
Collect 7 Stonetears.	Tears of Stone	As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems. Her words ring true; in the glade to the west, I have seen the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals. Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to. We must gather them. 
Obtain 8 Resonite Crystals.	Da Voodoo: Resonite Crystal	The final ingredient for the voodoo ritual is a special type of crystal called resonite. It can only be found in the Boulderslide caverns, west of here. Beware the kobolds! They guard the resonite with their lives! 
Sabotage the Master Control Pump at the bottom of Irontree Cavern.	Oil and Irony	I plan to use the goblin's greed and pollution against them. Any further despoiling of the land they have already carved here will be worth it to stop their further spread. Deep within Irontree Cavern, just below us, runs many pipes to pump oil through the ground across the entire clearing. These pipes are attached to a master control pump in the very back of the cavern. Enter the cavern and sabotage the pump. The ensuing havok will give us opportunity for our final strike. 
Deliver Life-Rockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southshore Blockaders.	Rocket Rescue	Alright, George. We've done enough small jobs around here; it's time to seal the deal. The ruins of Steamwheedle Port are still full of hapless Steamwheedle goblins, waiting to be rescued. Every single one of them is a potential future customer. They're firing on every boat that leaves port...so I say we take to the skies! There's a hot air balloon just outside of town near the docks, we can use that. Go ahead and hop in, I'll catch up with you. 
Kill Captain Dreadbeard.	Captain Dreadbeard	Alright, babe, I've got something bigger for you to take on here. We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south; that's to the south, and NOT the one we've been suicidally bum-rushing for the better part of several hours. He's sitting up there, smug and stoic, watching us war down here. I'll spare you the ""hostile takeover"" jokes. Get on his ship and beat the tar out of him, and we're done here! 
Kill 8 Southsea Cutthroats or Privateers on Fray Island.	Southsea Freebooters	Gazlowe promised me a promotion if I can help him with Ratchet's pirate issues. The problem is these new buccaneers that sailed in and took over Fray Island, south of here. They're not just after our goods - they've got grudges to settle! The other night they even went after one of our war galleons. I've got plans in the works to deal with the situation, but Gazlowe wants to see quick results. Head over to Fray Island and start lopping off some heads, will you? 
Question the nearby Razormane prisoner. If he's not there or unconscious, Togrik can revive him for you.	By Hook Or By Crook	I suppose he'll come around with some cold water to the face. What do you think he'll tell us? I'll secure him inside our livestock pen behind me here. I don't think he'll stay conscious long. Find out what you can about why the quilboar are attacking our farms! I'll leave the interrogation methods up to your better judgment. 
Speak with Sabina Pilgrim at the southern edge of Thunder Peak's lava flow in Ashenvale.	Go With The Flow	<The worgen stares at you intently before launching into his request.>The volcano threatens to engulf all of Ashenvale if we do not act quickly. Let me assure you, this was no natural eruption. My sister, Sabina, is powerful. She has gone east to the edge of Thunder Peak's lava flow, just north of the road to enlist the aid of the other elements against the fire lord that has caused this destruction. George, go to her and give her what assistance you can. 
You are to collect 20 Satyr Sabers from the weapon racks and various satyrs in the region, then place them upon the statue, Elune's Handmaiden.	To the Hilt!	You immediately recognize this statue from a sketch in Furien's Journal. Though the words associated with the entry elude you, the sketch seems self-explanatory. After battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort. As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack.... 
Collect Grimtotem Keys from the Grimtotem Tauren in Blackhoof Village and use them to free 5 Theramore Prisoners.	Prisoners of the Grimtotems	We're doing all we can to keep the Grimtotem raiders at bay, but they keep launching assaults on the tower. Even worse, they've managed to discover and capture the patrols the captain sends out to gather information and safeguard the road. I suspect the captives are being held in Blackhoof Village, to the northwest. Knowing the Grimtotems, the defenders of the village probably carry the keys to the prisoners' cages with them. I don't care what you have to do, Mechanic, just bring back my men alive. 
Bring the Darkmist Amulet to Sage Palerunner.	Return to Sage Palerunner	The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. This must be the amulet Sage Palerunner sent you here for... 
Gather 8 Hyjal Eggs.	Scrambling for Eggs	There's a pattern to these Wormwing attacks. While groups make a showy assault on the shrine itself, others swoop into the nearby nests and make off with eggs from all the flying creatures of Hyjal. These animals are under our protection. Before we find out why the Wormwing are doing this, it's up to us to rescue as many eggs as we can from their talons. 
Report to Master Thal'darah at Thal'darah Overlook in Stonetalon Mountains.	Warn Master Thal'darah	There are dozens of students at Thal'darah Grove. Most of them have no means of defending themselves, ripe for the slaughter. You must get word to Master Thal'darah of the Horde's plans. He will direct you in what you must do next. Fiora Moonsoar has granted you the use of her fastest hippogryph. Take it now to Thal'darah Overlook! Don't look back, George! The Horde must be stopped! 
Deliver the Crate of Spare Parts to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains.	Spare Parts Up In Here!	Whew, that was tough. I didn't think we'd make it, George. We better get these parts back to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz. I think I hear the gnome flying machines buzzing outside. We haven't got a minute to lose! 
Speak to Overlord Krom'gar at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains.	The General is Dead	Perhaps if you spoke to Overlord Krom'gar, George. Maybe he would listen to what you had to say? You are a Champion in his army, after all. You saw everything. Please help us, George. We simply wish to be left alone - in peace. Talk to Overlord Krom'gar and try to help him see that we did not mean for any of this to happen. 
Talk to Captain Krazz at Bilgewater Harbor in Azshara.	Pre-Flight Checklist	This new engine is extremely fast. And dangerous. I'd use the word ""volatile.""That's the way the Captain likes it. Run back up the hill and let him know that I'll install this bad boy right now and that he should meet me at the construction site. 
Obtain the Alliance's Proposal.	Get Koalbeard!	If we're going to get those oil drilling rights, we need to know what the Alliance is offering. How can we win if we can't do them one better?!Their negotiator, Kravel Koalbeard, is up there talking with one of their khans right now. Why don't you head up and persuade him to hand over the Alliance's proposal? You don't have to kill him... we're not savages! Just rough him up a bit. 
Find the Sacred Receptacle.	The Prophet's Dying Words	We... are... bound by oath... to protect the scepter of Orsis. Listen, Mechanic, I don't have much time... left. Find the sacred receptacle... in the southern end of the city. Do not... let it... fall into their... hands... 
Senani Thunderheart at Silverwind Retreat wants you to collect 15 Furbolg Ears from Foulweald Totemics and Foulweald Ursas.	Thinning the... Herd?	The furbolg are more numerous than we expected in these southern regions. They have also been far more aggressive here than we would like. With our resources divided between hunting down elves and harvesting much-needed lumber, that leaves you to help me put an end to our furbolg distraction. I have research to conduct here. In the meantime, I need you to take a more hands-on approach. Bring me the ears of nearby furbolg as proof to Tarkan that the problem is being dealt with. 
Gather information by defeating 10 Risen Husks or Risen Spirits.	What's Haunting Witch Hill?	I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it...Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl! 
Speak with Sauranok the Mystic at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	Sauranok Will Point the Way	I see you haven't yet spoken to the Warchiefs... other... advisor, Sauranok the Mystic. He has been at their side since our campaign together in Northrend. To assault the Twilight Highlands, we're going to need a map of the shoreline. I have tasked Sauranok with digging up this information. See if he can use your assistance! 
Bring a Shimmering Frond to Denalan. He can usually be found at Lake Al'Ameth, but sometimes travels to Wellspring Hovel.	The Shimmering Frond	The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura. You believe that Denalan would want a specimen of this. 
Speak with Juisheng Halfclaw to learn about combat specializations.	What's Your Specialty?	Hey, George! Have you decided on a combat specialization yet? Since you're a Mechanic, you already know about the different classes available to adventurers. But did you know that there are also areas of specialization within each class? Choosing a specialization is an important decision. Your specialty determines your combat role in a party, as well as the kinds of weapons and abilities that you will use. Let's go speak with Juisheng Halfclaw to learn more about specializations! 
Use Tabetha's Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post.	Raze Direhorn Post!	There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new ""neighbors"" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor. 
Return to Kelek Skykeeper at Lake Kel'theril in Winterspring.	The Curse of Zin-Malor	You have seen enough. Know that the Crystal of Zin-Malor brings only ruin to all around it. Leave this place, if you do not wish to join us. 
Collect 6 Prairie Wolf Paws and 4 Plainstrider Talons.	Poison Water	Our sacred wells have been tainted, and I will need your help to fix this. To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well. To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt prairie wolves for their paws and adult plainstriders for their talons. They are to the southwest. Return to me with the paws and talons, George. 
Speak with Riznek at the Splithoof Heights in Thousand Needles.	Back to Riznek	I am NOT stupid! Go back to your master and tell him that there will be NO deal! That is, if you can survive to make it back to him. 
Speak to Salhet and slay 30 Bloodsnarl Scavengers.	Salhet the Tactician	Ever since I was a cub, I've always wanted to be a general. I was eager to join the army. But as you've seen, my combat skills are not all quite there. This is not the first time I've been sent to kill hyenas. As a matter of fact, I get sent here so often, that I've befriended these lions and trained them to do my bidding. They are my soldiers and at my command they will slay legions of hyenas. Watch! 
Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Thistle Bear Spirit.	Spirit of the Thistle Bear	In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them. If you wish to align yourself with the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, take this incense to a cave just east of the great whirlpool. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me. 
	Salve via Hunting	 
Activate the Reactor Control Console and escort the Azsharite Core back to the Southern Rocketway Terminus. Use the Fireliminator X-21 on the Core if it starts to overheat.	Segmentation Fault: Core Dumped	Once we flush the central reactor, I need you to return the core to me. It's 100% refined azsharite crystal, which is both powerful and dangerous. And lovely. Oh precious azsharite, the shaper of worlds to come! The giant lever to your left will dump the core and send it to me via the rail system. The core will be superheated, so you'll need to periodically douse it with the Fireliminator on the way here... don't let it reach critical temperature! 
Report to Priestess Dentaria at Lor'danel in Darkshore.	Hero's Call: Darkshore!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Priestess Dentaria at Lor'danel in Darkshore. The people of Lor'danel need your aid in caring for the survivors of Auberdine's destruction and securing their town against Twilight's Hammer. Speak to Vesprystus, the hippogryph master at Rut'theran Village outside of Darnassus and he'll arrange a flight to Darkshore. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Report to Commander Molotov on Forlorn Ridge.	Another Warm Body	Oh have I got a deal for you! Immerse yourself in foreign cultures, go on epic adventures, blow things up, and get paid to do it! Sound too good to be true? Well it's not - this is what we do! If you're interested, head over to Gallywix Defense Post on Forlorn Ridge to the north and look for Commander Molotov. 
Collect 12 Black Empire Armaments from Black Empire cultists in Uldum and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Otherworldly Armaments	To craft a saddle for your beast, I'll need some special materials. Mainly, it will require metals much lighter than what we have available. I have noticed that the Black Empire cultists carry with them weapons made from otherworldly materials, which are impossibly light and strong. If you could retrieve some of their weapons for me, I may be able to melt down this metal and shape it into a saddle for the aqir. 
Kill 15 Deadwood Furbolg of any kind in Felpaw Village.	Deadwood of the North	There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest. Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem. The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds. Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped. It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren. Please, George - I ask you to do what must be done. Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much. 
Take the Krom'gar General's Insignia back to High Chieftain Cliffwalker at Cliffwalker Post in Stonetalon Mountains.	Betrayal at the Grove	Druid corpses litter the room. Something seems amiss, as you see no signs of a struggle. Bloody drag marks lead in from the doorway. You pry Orthus' death grip open to find something disturbing in his hand: a Krom'gar General's insignia. Take the Krom'gar General's insignia back to High Chieftain Cliffwalker. 
Collect 7 Deadwood Weapons from Felpaw Village.	Disarming Bears	I would prefer to do as much as we can to protect my people from the Deadwood tribe without slaughtering every last one of them. We've taken steps towards this before, and if you wish to prove yourself to the Timbermaw tribe, I would ask you do this as well. Look for the piles of weapons kept in Felpaw Village to the southwest. Take as many as you find. If we disarm the Deadwood tribe, we may be able to stop some bloodshed later. 
Retrieve 5 Starfall Relics from the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den.	Out of Harm's Way	Luckily, when the infestation occured, no druids were slumbering in the western barrow den. It is still a sacred site to us, however, and its depths hold blessed relics kept there undisturbed for ages. While I am somewhat trusting of the goblin exterminators, I am also... familiar with the habits of their race. Please retrieve any relics you can find in the barrow den and bring them back to me so they are not damaged. They are within urns, nestled in the small alcoves throughout the den. 
Use the Bucket of Burning Pitch on the silithid mounds outside of Fort Triumph to flush out and kill 10 Silithid Swarmers.	Working the Bugs Out	Why high command decided that a silithid mound was the ideal place to build a fortress, I'll never know. Them lil' buggers are tunneling under our fortifications and setting back our timetables. We need to scorch 'em out! Take this here bucket of burning pitch and dump it on the silithid mounds right outside the main gate. They look like big piles of sand. Kill anything that comes out, but be careful, George - them nasties are likely to swarm you when you light those mounds up. 
Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.	The Sands of Silithus	Let's see... oh, here's a good one! Silithus! So, apparently the Cenarion Circle needs assistance with an insect infestation of some sort.<Vizzie shivers.>Ugh! No thanks, not for me. I'm perfectly happy freezing to death here in Everlook if the alternative is bugs. Hmm... it says here that visitors should speak with Windcaller Proudhorn, and the easiest way to get there is via the path up Un'Goro Crater's northwestern cliffs. You interested? 
Collect 8 Troll Charms.	A Not-So-Charmed Life	The furbolg covet that which does not belong to them.<Hephaestus turns the charm over in his hand and then discards it.>There's a property to the carving that slowly corrupts those that aren't trolls. As I understand it, the furbolg have done this sort of thing before. Some never learn. No doubt they hoard most of the charms in Thistlefur Hold above their village to the north. 
Collect 20 Unpopped Darkmist Eyes from Darkmist spiders.	Jarl Needs Eyes	Eye juice is good juice for drinking. Too bad most critters only have two eyes. But spiders have lots of eyes. Lots and lots. And Darkmist eye juice is tasty. Smooth and salty! Unpopped spider eyes... I taste them already. Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern. You figure the spiders are named after the cave... or is it the other way around? 
Collect 8 Ghost-o-plasms.	Ghost-o-plasm Round Up	There's a valley to the southeast, the Valley of Bones, haunted by Magram ghosts. Sounds scary, doesn't it? Well think how scary it is to the Magram! If we captured ghost energy from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs. Here, take this crate of ghost magnets. If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the Dead Goliaths, then ghosts will wander to it. Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm--that's what we'll sell to the Magram. 
Place 3 Swoop Eggs in Swoop Nests and protect them until they are collected.	Early Adoption	As the region becomes more lush, the creatures of the desert are being forced into increasingly confined spaces. A particularly distressing result is the impending extinction of the local swoops. Predators feast on the birds and their eggs when they take nest. I have acquired some swoop eggs from Tanaris and coated them with an irresistible pheromone. Place one in each nest you find, then protect it until a swoop comes to carry it off. You will be doing a service to the balance of this land. 
Escort the Ramkahen Ranger Captain to higher ground.	Salhet's Gambit	Neferset City is too well defended. The mountain next to it, however, is not. I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop. There is one catch, George. He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them. It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me... the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come. With you by their side we'll surely succeed. 
Use the Horn of Cenarius to help you slay Azralon the Gatekeeper.	The Gatekeeper	According to these tomes, one of Ragnaros' most powerful lieutenants serves as the sole gatekeeper to Sulfuron Spire. You won't be able to defeat him alone. Sound this horn when you engage in combat with Azralon and any of our forces in the vicinity will come to your aid. You must hurry, George. It won't be long before the Firelord realizes what we're up to. 
Watch the Aqir Egg hatch in Ramkahen.	Coming Out of His Shell	It looks like our egg is ready to hatch! Isn't this exciting! Come, let us welcome our new little friend to this world. 
Use Jin'Zil's Voodoo Stick to infuse 12 Krom'gar Marauders with Voodoo.	Jin'Zil's Blessing	Ah, it is done! Now to test it out. Travel to the main point of conflict within Greatwood Vale and use my voodoo stick on the Krom'gar marauders battling the Grimtotem. My voodoo magic should renew their vigor and allow them to crush our enemies! Go now, George! 
Speak with Gornek.	Your Place In The World	Finally, you are of age, George... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief. Yes...<Kaltunk looks you over.>You will do nicely. No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.<Kaltunk laughs.>Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young Mechanic. You will find him seated at the fire behind me. 
Kill any combination of 5 Plains Prowlers or Plains Pridemanes.	Lion's Pride	If you seek vengeance on our Alliance invaders, you would do well to observe the fiercest of predators in the Barrens. The lions that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power. Learn from their example and you will understand the kind of war we need to fight. Hunt the plains prowlers and pridemanes, then return to me to discuss what you have learned. You will often find them in the shade of large trees. 
Take a flight to Talonbranch Glade and speak with Denmother Ulrica.	The Denmother	Barely a crow's flight to the north, goblins ravage this forest, clearcutting it to fuel the war machines of the Horde and line their own pockets. This one pays enough pleasant words and crafted lies to the druids here for them to turn a blind eye, afraid to disturb the tenuous neutrality here. The worgen of Talonbranch Glade have had enough. Join us! The hippogryph master can take you directly to our home. Denmother Ulrica will welcome any Human who wishes to fight. 
Kill 12 Durotar Harpies. Any type of harpy will suffice.	Securing the Lines	Gazlowe told me once, ""Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself.""I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Harpies plague our supply routes. If we kill the harpies, the caravans are safe. Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's ""You can get anything done for a price."" You in, George? Good... I recommend starting in the canyon to the east. 
Kill Durrin Direshovel and obtain Durrin's Archaeological Findings.	A Tale of Two Shovels	Hey wait a minute, this bone has pickax marks on it. These aren't yours, are they? No, I recognize this mark... this must be that blasted dwarf! Gah! Let me step back for a minute and explain. There's another archaeologist south of here named Durrin Direshovel. He practices a reckless, devil-may-care brand of archaeology that offends even me. A priceless fossil, ruined by sloppy pick-work. This is the last straw, Durrin! George, go put an end to Direshovel and his negligent excavation. 
Collect the Doomstone.	The Doomstone	At the core of Animus is an artifact known as the Doomstone. One of its properties is an ability to absorb a great deal of energy. This is how the cultists are trying to set off the explosion... by overloading the stone and amplifying the power through the elemental. Bring me the Doomstone. For safe keeping, of course. 
Jinar'Zillen wants you to collect 5 Shellfish from the traps near Shadowprey Village.	Fish in a Bucket	I'll reward anyone who makes my life a bit easier... I enjoy doing as little as possible, mon! Below the docks here in Shadowprey Village, I've many shellfish traps. If you're kind enough to do my work and collect me my shellfish, then I'll reward you with something you want... get my drift mon? 
Speak with Harrison Jones at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind City.	That's No Pyramid!	That pyramid at the Maker's Terrace in Uldum is nothing of the sort. It's a giant machine that can be reconfigured for any number of uses. Deathwing was going to have the Twilight's Hammer turn it into a massive weapon! George, you have to take the portal to get this information to Harrison Jones in Stormwind. He'll know what to do. 
Slay 5 Failed Supplicants at Doom's Vigil.	Spiritual Training: Mercy is for the Weak	You've made it this far. Others haven't. Go to Doom's Vigil, just north of here. We've rounded up all the... failures. I want you to help take care of them. It'll be good for your spiritual growth. If this cold-blooded act gives you trouble, think of it as their second chance. Should any of them manage to kill you... well, they'll take your spot. 
Take the Blood Elf Communication to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.	Bandits!	This appears to be a bounty ledger. You cannot understand the blood elf language but you note that there is a picture depicting a dead draenei, a smiling blood elf standing over the corpse, and a symbol of what you think is some sort of blood elf currency. They've put a hit out on draenei! You must inform the exarch. 
Bring the Seedling Protector to 7 patches of Rich Soil.	Seeking Soil	<The tiny sproutling shuffles around, motioning you towards the south. You can barely hear a faint voice.>Soil...<It looks like it wants fresh soil. Maybe you should guide it to some of the richer-looking patches.> 
Use the Krom'gar Demolisher to destroy 5 Darnassian Glaive Throwers and any 20 Alliance soldiers in Battlescar Valley.	To Battlescar!	I will allow this old fool time to plead his case. He has assured me that he will bring back proof that the night elves do not harbor a weapon of mass destruction. We shall see. While we await this proof, you will assist our army in the valley. We have prepared a large number of siege tanks for this purpose. Our demolishers are poised for attack. Take the elevator down to the base of the outpost and take control of a Krom'gar demolisher. Use it to lay waste to our enemies in Battlescar Valley. 
Collect 7 pieces of Suspicious Green Sludge from Scalding Springsurges or Boiling Springbubbles.	Scalding Signs	The cauldron looked like it contained concentrated material. If the Winterfall are diluting this stuff directly in the springs, contamination could build up over time... and then the dilution would be less and less effective. The spring to the northeast has boiled over with elementals. I thought it was because of the cataclysm, but their appearance could be a reaction to this. Could you check them for corruption? Hunt a few and bring me any bits of green foreign material they leave behind. 
Find Drizle in Felpaw Village.	Stupid Drizle!	Stupid, stupid Drizle! I told him not to go! Drizle wanted to steal more honey from Felpaw Village... you know, just west of here? You can see it from the cliff...Anyway... I told him it was a dumb idea but he went anyway, and then the Deadwood tribe got him, and... and...Sniff...I don't know what they're gonna do! Please find him, <Mr./Ms.> Human! Even if he is a dummy! I don't want Drizle to get eaten! 
Kill a Barrens Operative and retrieve the SI:7 Briefings.	Intelligence Warfare	I am convinced the Alliance is using spies to scout the field and pass along information. They knew to strike at Taurajo while the hunters were afield. And they countered every one of Gar'dul's moves like he was an open book. Well George, I for one will not be outplayed. Not here. We will win the battle for intelligence. Even now I hear reports of Alliance operatives slinking around in the shadows, especially here, outside these very walls. Kill them and bring me back something of use. 
Use an Astranaar Thrower to shoot down 15 Hellscream's Hellions & their Watch Wind Riders.	Return Fire	The fires are mostly contained, but we have to do something about those wind riders! Quick, George, you have to jump into one of our glaive throwers and return fire! 
Speak with Quentin at Freewind Post in Thousand Needles.	Free Freewind Post	Alas, it's time for you to leave. How quickly the chicks fall from the nest. Or, something. Anyway, you've done solid work here, my friend, but Quentin and the night elves have been crying that they urgently need your help with the Grimtotem at Freewind Post to the northwest. If you ask me, it's a lost cause, but who knows... maybe with your help they'll actually succeed? 
Kill 7 Mountain Giants. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Mountain Giants.	Mountain Giant Muisek	The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the Burning Legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain. I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek. 
Fill the Amethyst Phial.	Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei	You must now visit the moonwell that rests under the boughs of the Oracle Tree, far to the northwest. The first and most powerful of our wells, its waters are said to possess the very essence of Elune's Powers. Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete. 
Collect 7 Blackhoof Armaments from Blackhoof Village.	More than Coincidence	We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth. Between the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm led to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture. 
Retrieve the Sarcen Stone from the bottom of Lake Mennar.	Mystery of the Sarcen Stone	Before she died, Kalytha was charged with burying something at the bottom of the lake, a powerful artifact that the archmages of Mennar spent their last moments creating. No doubt Malynea Skyreaver will want to see the artifact, presuming it still exists. You resolve to search the bottom of Lake Mennar for the Sarcen Stone. 
Bring Galaen's Amulet to Morae at Blood Watch.	Galaen's Fate	You have no means of identifying the corpse as Galaen with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables. The blood elves in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet. Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves. 
Speak to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch.	What We Know...	We've learned much of our enemies in recent days. The blood elves are led by a being known as Sironas and plot to destroy us. Ultimately, they seek to enslave O'ros and regain control of the Exodar. Light be praised, we have stopped their supply line by destroying the sun gate. Unfortunately, they continue to use the contaminant of the Vector Coil to poison the land, using the mutagenic properties of the fallout to their advantage. With this knowledge, Admetius has devised a plan. Seek him out. 
Slay 7 Withervine Creepers or Withervine Ragers in the marsh north of Brackenwall Village.	A Shambling Threat	Dustwallow is Horde territory, George. The humans may have their little island and their precious sand bar, but the marsh belongs to us. In time, we will surely win this stalemate with the humans. For now, we must master our own territory. The withervine bog beasts to the north rise from the marsh itself to attack any living thing that approaches. If we own this marsh, we must not let our own land fight back against us! Slay the bog beasts, if you wish to serve the Horde. You will be rewarded. 
Collect 7 Power Crystals of each color: red, blue, yellow, and green.	Crystals of Power	I'm sure you've noticed 'em, George. They're everywhere! What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course! The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me? You'll find yellow crystals to the northwest, red crystals to the... oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out. 
You are to slay 8 Diseased Vultures.	Dirty Birds	The sky above the Shriveled Oasis is littered with these nasty vultures. Like infectious rodents with wings, these creatures serve no great purpose and inflict untold misery. Rid the skies of this nuisance and leave the region better than you found it. 
Bring the glowing fruit to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.	The Glowing Fruit	Hanging from beneath the fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit. Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain. 
Assemble the true name by examining the three Firestones in the Inferno.	The Name Never Spoken	Did my drought work? You spoke with one of them? Then you know what to do. The name of their elemental master is written on three firestones scattered throughout the Inferno. Examine each of these stones and we will have the name we need. Hurry! Your precious forest burns! 
Gorbold Steelhand at Lor'danel wants you to speak to Gary for further instructions.	An Ocean Not So Deep	You look like an able sort! There are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here... most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned. Worry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really. 
Collect 4 heaps of Core Hound Entrails.	Fresh Bait	I was stunned to discover that Twilight's Hammer had located - and imprisoned - the great turtle ancient Tortolla. As we speak he is chained above the murky waters of the Ashen Lake. Freeing Tortolla from his bonds will not be easy. But we will take it one step at a time. Head into the Flamewake and collect for me heaps of core hound entrails. I will explain why later. And beware of Nemesis the Usurper while you are there! His time will come, but we are not yet prepared. 
Collect 8 Infected Stag Antlers.	Signs of Change	A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass. The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers. 
Return to Ian Duran at the Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal.	Return from the Firelands	I'll usher out the rest of Goldrinn's followers and seal this portal behind us. The rest of our forces at Mount Hyjal will want to hear of this victory. Return to Ian Duran and let him know what we've discovered and how we were triumphant! Simply step through the portal to return to Mount Hyjal. 
Put on your new wizard hat and then speak to the Image of Archmage Xylem just northeast of the Northern Rocketway Exchange.	Dressed to Impress	Every man's got to learn his own lessons I suppose. Here, take my wizard hat. I have no doubt that he'll take you on as an apprentice if you look the role... you just might have to jump through some hoops first. Tiny flaming hoops, suspended over spikes, with spinning blades on the other side. You should be able to find an image of Xylem on top of that hill to the northeast. 
Report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary in Felwood.	Warchief's Command: Felwood!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary in Felwood. The Cenarion Circle requires your help to wrest Felwood from the control of demons and other corrupt creatures! To reach the Emerald Sanctuary, travel north from Ashenvale and follow the road until you reach the sanctuary. Destiny calls! 
Destroy the 3 sets of Attack Plans held within Northwatch Foothold.	The War of Northwatch Aggression	These humans in the west, they don't just wanna camp out in Durotar, mon. They got bigger plans, and those plans involve takin' our home and leavin' our skulls on pikes. Well I'm not havin' it. Nope! Not Lar! I've got family here in Sen'jin, and I'll be damned if I let one of those brutes put my Tai'tasi's head on a stick! They've got their plans written down in there, mon. Big scrolls, real important-lookin'. We gonna burn those scrolls before they burn us. 
Kill 9 Theramore Infiltrators, then return to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.	Theramore Spies	The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce. Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top! Now is the chance to do just that. Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village. They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow. Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them. Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence! 
Report to Spark Nilminer at Golakka Hot Springs.	Adventures in Archaeology	Hey, you want to try my new diemetradon dogs? No? Raptor risotto? Pterrordax ptacos? Fine. Oh, I just remembered! I have a friend nearby that might be able to use your assistance. His name is Spark Nilminer, and he's Marshal Expeditions' chief archaeology officer. He's been sent out to Golakka Hot Springs, to the west. You'll likely find him on the springs' western shore. 
Use the Sturdy Rope to capture 6 Bloodfen Raptors or Bloodfen Screechers.	Raptor Captor	The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors. Take this rope and use it to capture Bloodfen raptors or Bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle. 
Speak to Harrison Jones at the Temple of Uldum.	Put That Baby in the Cradle!	Och! You an' junior took yer sweet time gettin' 'ere, din't ya!?<Drinkin' ale/Holdin' hands>, takin' in the sights, I'll wager. Don't go breakin' yer arm pattin' yerself on the back now, the real work's just beginnin'!There be more ta this ancient artifact than ye know, but in order ta reveal its secrets, we need ta get it to the Cradle of the Ancients! Now howdya spose we do that? Maybe junior over there has some bright ideas, eh? 
Retrieve a sample from a decomposing bear carcass east of Buzzbox 413.	No Accounting for Taste	<The machine buzzes for a few moments before Wizbang's voice breaks through.>Interesting! The source of this corruption definitely came from something external--no surprises there--but it appears that in this case they've been eating something foul. A large mammal probably. Most likely a bear. Search the beach for a bear carcass for me. Slightly east of there would make the most sense, on the inland side of the beach. Bring me the sample back at town. 
Use Aetherion's Ritual Orb and obtain Aetherion's Essence.	Call Down the Thunder	Aetherion is almost in our world, but he can still be dealt with! At the end of the dock floats a ritual orb. I want you to use it to complete the ritual, beckoning the elemental lord down from his vortex. Trust me, George, I and the other spirits that you have freed will greatly weaken Aetherion. However, it will be up to you to finish him off for good and save the Kaldorei people of Darkshore from utter destruction. Deliver his essence to Corvine Moonrise at the refugee camp so he will know. 
Break 5 Darkwhisper Lodestones.	Physical Training: Forced Labor	Training to join our ranks is not pleasant. Why should it be? The path to serve the Old Gods is long, painful, and soul-harrowing. Consider this your first step. Take this pick and break the lodestone deposits found in the gorge. No, we don't need any of the ore. This is purely for your benefit. 
Find the location described in Nolkai's journal and discover his long-buried possessions.	Nolkai's Words	The translation is ready now, George.<Anchorite Paetheus points out a block of text at the end of his translation.>'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here. I've taken care to bury my last few possessions on the grounds of the temple, with the hope that someone will find them and know what happened here.' 
Report to Scout Commander Barus at Mirkfallon Post in Stonetalon Mountains.	Bombs Away: Mirkfallon Post!	Scout Commander Barus, stationed at Mirkfallon Post, to the northwest, has spotted the Horde bomb. The Krom'gar hot air balloon, with bomb attached, is currently at the new goblin fueling station at Mirkfallon Lake. This might be the opportunity we need to take that thing out once and for all. Gather your things, George, and move out! Scout Commander Barus awaits your arrival at Mirkfallon Post. And George, your tenacity is a testament to the strength and fortitude of the Alliance! Glory be unto you! 
Use the Herald's Incense before Aviana's Egg at the Shrine of Aviana.	An Ancient Reborn	I'm convinced that YOU are the herald of Aviana, George. It was you who first saw her and rescued her essence from the claws of a dragon. Yes, I believe Aviana is to be reborn into our world. And you shall have the honor of ushering her over the threshold. Take this incense and burn it before Aviana's egg in the room just above me. The ancient awaits, George. Our deliverance is here! 
Kill 9 Irontree Shredders.	The Shredders of Irontree	Disgusting, isn't it? Look at them. Pathetic little things that can't even toil with their own bodies. They stomp around in their massive metal shredders, carving the forest to splinters. I bet they think they're safe in there, all warm and cozy. Prove them wrong. Blaze north through the camp and destroy as many shredders as you can. Once you've spilled some blood, we're going to take this place apart for good. 
Collect 8 Entropic Essences from Entropic Horrors in Shatter Scar Vale.	Collecting Corruption	Though we druids shun the demonic powers infesting this land, it must still be confronted. Shatter Scar Vale to the south seethes with corruption. The energies there are so chaotic that they manifest as violent entities, pure fel magic given form to lash out at all life. I have been keeping a close eye on these chaotic beasts, and studying their strength. I need to make sure they are still weakening with time. Bring me the essences they drop, so I may ensure they are diminishing. 
Meet Overlord Krom'gar at Cliffwalker Post in Stonetalon Mountains.	Might Makes Right	You have done well to report this crime. The perpetrators of this heinous act will be punished. There will be blood. I will need a new General now that Grebo is dead. You shall take his place. Meet me at Cliffwalker Post, General. Together we will end this nonsense. 
Kill 15 Palemane Gnolls then return to Ahmo Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village.	Sharing the Land	George, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as our elders have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land. Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled. Words are no longer the answer. 
Speak to Admiral Aubrey to fly to the Blackpool and kill 6 Rageroar Sea Dogs.	Repel Boarders!	George, the sea is our only lifeline, and right now most of my fleet is either steaming back to Theramore for repairs or rusting at the bottom of this bay. Only the Blackpool remains afloat to defend our harbor. But she's just signaled that she's being boarded! Speak to me when you're ready, I'll have one of our naval gryphons deposit you right on the deck. Slaughter the rageroar sea dogs who dare assault my precious ship and report to Captain Fisher for further orders. 
Kill 6 Blackfathom Tide Priestesses.	Deep Despair	There is more to this naga problem than meets the eye, Mechanic. It appears that the issue will not be resolved by merely thinning their numbers. To humble them, a more severe impression must be made. Travel to the northern end of Zoram Strand and enter Blackfathom Deep. Once there, demonstrate to the naga that their presence in this region will no longer be tolerated! 
Get the Ship Schematics from Chief Engineer Foote at the Broken Keel Tavern in Ratchet.	Club Foote	All this new friction between the Alliance and the Horde was leading to windfall profits, until Rear Admiral Hartley sailed into MY harbor and started poking his prow into my business. He's been searching and seizing vessels flying horde colors with the goal of depriving them use of a neutral port. I'm not about to allow some fat-fingered human to cut into my profits! Get me the schematics of his flagship. Hartley's Chief Engineer is soaking himself at the Broken Keel Tavern just up the hill... 
Take the Dwarven Slug to Alto Stonespire at Brackenwall Village in Dustwallow Marsh.	Next of Kin	<Nato pulls you aside and speaks in a whisper.>George, I have removed the bullet from Gann's chest, but the bubbles in his blood tell me all I need to know. His lungs are punctured, and the wound grows septic. He is not long for this world. Take this. It's the bullet that killed him. His family will want to know what became of their youngest warrior. Seek out Alto Stonespire. He is posted in Dustwallow Marsh. Go northeast, and follow the roads to Brackenwall Village. 
Speak with Kulg Gorespatter in Ashenvale.	Probing into Ashenvale	Even as the Darnassian scum pull back from Azshara, I've been getting mixed reports from my riders stationed in Ashenvale, to the west. The night elves may be making an assault on our territory in the Barrens. Mechanic, I need you to slip across the border and speak to one of my scouts. Look for Kulg Gorespatter just across the bridge at the southwest edge of Talrendis Point. Find out what's happening in those woods! 
Obtain the Broodqueen Pedipalp.	SMASH BROODQUEEN	<The following is written in very large print.>SPIDERS IN NORTH CAVE BAD. POISON OGRES. OGRES GET SICK. BAD! BIG BIG SPIDER IN CAVE MAKE MORE SPIDERS. MORE SPIDERS BAD! KILL BIG SPIDER, STOP MORE SPIDERS. KILL BIG SPIDER, GET BIG PRIZE! GOOD!<A crude drawing accompanies this.> 
Slay any 10 Neferset intruders at the Tombs of the Precursors.	Punish the Trespassers	We, priests of Nahom, are guardians of the Tombs of the Precursors. Ever since the Neferset turned to their new masters, they've turned to great heresies. They rob the sacred tombs of our forefathers, seeking powerful artifacts and destroying invaluable relics in the process. Go to the tombs, east of here and punish the tomb-robbers for their transgressions, lest they join their brethren when the Neferset attack on Nahom begins. 
Slay 6 Twilight Inferno Lords within the Inferno.	Disrupting the Rituals	The firestorms up ahead are unbound elementals in the purest form - something I didn't think could exist outside their own plane. Only very skilled summoners could unleash something like this. George, head into the Inferno and seek out Twilight Inferno Lords. They've got to be summoning in reinforcements as we speak. Silence them... For good! 
Bring 30 Runecloth to Meilosh in Timbermaw Hold.	Runecloth	In Timbermaw, we are content. We do not like strangers. This is good for us, but it is bad for trade. Not long ago, a rare night elf friend came to Timbermaw and she wore a runecloth cloak. runecloth is rare among us, but the cloak was so fine my people want me to make more runecloth clothing. Will you bring me runecloth? If you bring me enough, then I will give you something in trade. 
Speak to Anara to return to the world of the living, then meet with Kalecgos at the Northern Rocketway Terminus.	Turning the Tables	Azuregos and Kalecgos are due to meet up at the Northern Rocketway Terminus. You should meet with them there to make sure that Kalecgos doesn't require any additional help. Should you prefer to not be dead, Anara will likely be able to help. 
Report to Captain Desoto in Bilgewater Harbor for deployment.	Rapid Deployment	You will be reporting for active duty immediately. Captain Desoto is overseeing deployment just down the ramp at the rocket launch station. Make us rich, soldier. Dismissed! 
Investigate the Hull of the Foebreaker.	Ready the Navy	Hellscream expects an armada of ships for his invasion, but the docks here are weeks behind schedule. Costs are rampant and quality is poor. Corruption is the problem, George! And I need you to root it out. The Foebreaker, a warship berthed at the northwest pier, should have been outfitted days ago. Something reeks. Go there and oversee the construction yourself. Find out who's disrupting our naval preparations and deal with them! 
Use the Butcherbot to harvest 10 Blisterpaw Hyena corpses.	Blisterpaw Butchery	The hyenas wandering the wastes here might look scrawny, but they've got some of the strongest jaws you'll find! If you're not careful, they'll take a leg off in one bite. That kind of bone strength is a valuable resource, my friend, just waiting to find a buyer! Take one of my Butcherbots with you. Jaw separation isn't an easy task, and this little guy has been set up to know exactly what to do. Just bring him back when he's full. 
Slay the Hive Controller.	That Smart One's Gotta Go	There's some kind of smart brain bug in the back of the cave. It's in charge of all of the silithid down there. My ice cream is melting! How am I supposed to launch my ice cream empire, and save my inventory, if that thing's in there?! 
Speak with ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl at Swamplight Manor.	The Hermit of Witch Hill	The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here. Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl, is already showing signs. I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it. The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across Bluefen and past North Point Tower. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called Witch Hill. 
Belloc Brightblade wants you to mingle with the guests at Schnottz's Landing.	Eastern Hospitality	The commander is quite busy now, I'm afraid. The demands of an operation such as this require much of his attention these days. While you wait to speak with him, why don't you mingle with some of our guests? We have invited a variety of Azeroth's most illustrious figures to be present when we unlock the secrets of this region. I am confident that you will find them most captivating. 
Obtain the Neferset Key from Kavem the Callous.	Kavem the Callous	Kavem was cruel enough before the Neferset signed up with Deathwing. His pleasure in deriving pain now borders on the insane. It is he who now holds the keys to our shackles. He dwells in the building next to us, to my right. Find him and take the key from him. Do not hesitate or show him mercy. He will slit your throat and think nothing of it. 
Deal with Jacob Anders at Southport.	Cleaning House	Not long ago, a new recruit showed up by the name o' Jacob Anders. He's been trouble since he got here, always drinkin' and pickin' fights, but he crossed the line this time. One o' our patrols spotted him tradin' intel with the Horde - he's a traitor, commander! I thought ye would want tae deal with him personally. He was out drinkin' by the water last time I saw him, and I'd bet me pappy's beard he's still there. 
Kill 10 Makrinni in the Ruins of Arkkoran.	That's Just Rude!	I'd share if they asked. They just go clickity-claking up my kawphi plants. So rude! You should teach them a lesson. Dumb Makrinni. 
Place the Twilight Drake Skull at the feeding grounds south of the Ascendant's Rise and slay Desperiona.	Death to the Broodmother	We've located the matriarch's feeding grounds south of the Ascendant's Rise. She will be extremely angry to have lost one of her drakes. Place the skull there near the carcasses she devours. If she's anywhere in the vicinity, she will come out and attempt to exact revenge. We will have a surprise waiting for her. 
Slay 15 Deadwood Furbolg of any type.	Ruumbo Demands Justice	You! Wanderer! Bow before the might of Ruumbo, great god of the Timbermaw tribe! Hear my will! The evil Deadwood tribe lives in the village behind me! They are big jerks! I mean, they... they sully my name with their wicked misdeeds! They persecute my cherished Timbermaw tribe and hurt them! I demand you inflict my justice! Defeat the Deadwood and I will give you my... my favor! Yes! The favor of RUUMBO! 
Slay 8 Talonbranch Defenders.	Take it to the Tree	Those mangy curs think they can just snoop around my site and get away with it? I'll show them...And what I mean by that is, of course, that YOU will show them. You and the small army of axe-wielding goblin hires I've sent to Talonbranch Glade. The place will be swarming with worgen by now. Just where we want them. Head to the southeast, join up with the rest of our forces, and let some fur fly. 
Slay 10 Grimtotem Invaders.	Grimtotem in the Post	You must do away with the Grimtotem invaders at Freewind Post. They brought it on themselves, the cowards! We can't take the fight to their territory with our back to them. Please help us take back our home, Mechanic. 
Assist Harrison Jones at the Khartut's Tomb.	Exploding Through	What a find! Right here... exactly where my notes predicted it would be. With any luck, inside this chamber will lie clues to the location of the legendary Coffer of the Promise. That's right, George. It's not just a myth. I believe it truly exists. I'll explain more later. For now, just give me a hand with these explosives. 
Collect the four Twilight Elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.	Four Twilight Elements	The Twilight's Hammer have summoned a monstrosity. It's a combination of the four elements infused with the power of their special ore, Elementium. If you want to save your precious Thousand Needles from total destruction, you're going to have to destroy it. But first, you'll need a few things to get through its protective shielding. Go east into the Withering and bring back the four Twilight elements. 
Speak with Bragok in Ratchet to fly to Theramore. Then report to Calia Hastings.	Flight to Theramore	Listen, I got no special love for the Alliance... but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either. Your gold is as good as anyone else's. Sometimes better. Jeyne left some gold for your travel costs. I believe the person you're looking for in Dustwallow goes by the name of Calia Hastings. And the best way to get there is to talk to our flight master, Bragok. He'll fly you there, if you want. The flight's free, thanks to your friend. 
Obtain Razorspine's Sword.	Jarl Needs a Blade	I have cutting to do. I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade. A certain blade...Some people call it a sword. I call it a swing blade. You help me? Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called.... There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need! But don't sleep on this. What I'm cutting won't keep forever... 
Speak with Avaros Dawnglaive at The Barracks in Orgrimmar.	Meet With Avaros Dawnglaive	Avaros Dawnglaive sent an urgent message for you, George. He asks you to join him at The Barracks in Orgrimmar's Valley of Honor the next time you're in the city. It sounds as though he must have an important assignment for you. 
Speak to a Ramkahen Sergeant and succeed in the Defense of Nahom.	The Defense of Nahom	The enemy is coming... and in great numbers. We will get no further reinforcements. Let us hope we can stop the Neferset advance. If Nahom falls, Ramkahen will follow. Go outside and speak to one of my sergeants when you're ready. I will help you command the forces we have to the best of my ability. 
Take Kalytha's Ring to the shores of Lake Mennar. Touch the Spirit of Kalytha to relive her memories. Speak to the other spirits until you've learned the secret of Lake Mennar.	Memories of the Dead	The runes on this ring you found are still legible: it was given to ""Kalytha"" when she was granted admission to the Academy. With the right spell or two, this personal trinket of hers is the gateway to her soul. Take the ring back to Lake Mennar. Kalytha's spirit should now be visible to you on the shore of the lake. Touch her and the ring will allow you to see the world as she sees it, forever reliving her final hours. Probe her mind, George! Speak to the others and learn the secrets of Lake Mennar... 
Report to Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze at the Ruins of Mathystra.	The Shatterspear Invaders	If we didn't have enough on our hands with the land and the elements turning against us, it seems something has riled up the trolls to the northeast, and they've started on a war path. I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the Tower of Althalaxx. We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand. 
Speak to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold in Stonetalon Mountains.	Fallowmere Beckons	You're still here? What are you waiting for, a personal engraved invitation? Lord Fallowmere beckons, fool! Go to him now! 
Slay High Chief Winterfall.	High Chief Winterfall	The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but if their leader is slain, they may not get any worse. Head east again, past where you found that cauldron. High Chief Winterfall is here, at the easternmost part of Timbermaw Post. 
Bring Sharptalon's Claw to Senani Thunderheart at Silverwind Refuge.	Sharptalon's Claw	The mighty hippogryph Sharptalon has been slain, with the claw of the felled beast serving as a testament to your victory. Senani Thunderheart at the Silverwind Refuge will no doubt be interested in seeing this trophy as proof of your deeds. 
Kill 8 Tidal Striders.	Puddle Stomping	There's a big problem here! It's great that the ocean came in so far, because now ships can get to Gadgetzan. But now there's a bunch of nasty old sea giants encroaching on the town! I'm sure Mister Noggenfogger would appreciate us taking care of them for him. Don't worry, I won't ask you to do it just out of the goodness of your heart! Take care of them and I'll give you a reward! 
Stand by as Maximillian of Northshire speaks to 2 Steam Furies.	The Spirits of Golakka Hot Springs	A moment of seriousness now, George. We have an important quest ahead of us. The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother. Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid. I have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs. Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid. 
Collect 10 Slitherblade Bones from Slitherblade Naga, 30 Slitherblade Scales from Slitherblade Sorceresses, and 4 Slitherblade Fins from Slitherblade Warriors.	Slitherblade Slaughter	Time and again, the naga have proven to be enemies to the balance of nature. I have no qualms with the spilling of their blood. Your best efforts though, would barely put a dent in their forces here. Where one falls, two seem to rise in their place. I have a plan, Mechanic. Your objective is not merely to take the lives of the enemy, but to gather components necessary for the next stage of our investigation.... 
Sabotage 7 Schnottz Powder Kegs.	Shroud of the Makers	It is good to have friends, Mechanic! While kindness is its own reward, there can be tangible benefits too! Some friends of mine recently intercepted a shipment of Schnottz's plunder and found something that should serve your needs nicely. It's a piece of titan technology that renders the user nearly invisible. If you use it in the enemy camp, you might be able to rewire their explosives and make a mess of their operation. Each charge has a limited duration, so don't stray too far from safety! 
Use the Talisman of Flame Ascendancy and slay Garnoth, Fist of the Legion, at the Gates of Sothann in Hyjal.	The Greater of Two Evils	We took Darkwhisper Gorge from the demons of the Burning Legion by force. We've held on to our territory pretty well so far, with one exception. We recently lost the Gates of Sothann to a pit lord and his army. We cannot allow this to stand. Use this talisman when you're near him. You'll gain the powers of a flame ascendant temporarily. Make it count. 
Collect 5 Goblin Mortar Shells from the Secret Lab complex in Azshara.	Mortar the Point	The Naga started making a move on the peninsula here after we finished building this rocketway terminal. But there's no problem in this world that can't be solved with gratuitous firepower! That's what my daddy used to say. Before the accident. I'm running short on supplies, though. Do me a favor and collect the mortar shells I left stockpiled in the Secret Lab just west of here. Keep me supplied and I'll let you call in the artillery strikes! 
Collect 10 Spirit Beads from Winterfall furbolg.	Winterfall Activity	The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, George. While we do allow safe passage to those we trust, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible. The Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us. They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand. The Winterfall carry spirit beads, which have clearly failed to protect them against corruption. Bring me 10 of these beads to show you have thinned their ranks. 
Find Orthus at Thal'darah Grove in Stonetalon Mountains.	Proof of Lies	At the heart of Battlescar Valley stands an ancient tree - a tree that has withstood the force of ages and has served as a place of peace and learning for generations. My kin have studied druidism at the grove, alongside the night elves, for as long as I can recall. Now I am to believe that the tree holds within it an Alliance weapon of mass destruction? Krom'gar is wrong and I will prove it! I have sent my son, Orthus, to Thal'darah Grove in search of this weapon. Go there now and meet him. 
Use Tomusa's Hook on Triumph War Gryphons to dismount and kill 5 Wildhammer Mercenaries.	Flightmare	The Alliance has hired in Wildhammer mercenaries to control the skies over the Battlescar. I believe these same gryphon-riders were the ones to firebomb Taurajo during the attack. I want our skies scoured clean. The wildhammer dwarves fly low enough for a sharp-eyed Mechanic to hook them. Take this. Target their gryphons and dismount the riders - once grounded, show them no mercy. 
Captain Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge wants you to defeat Tideress and 12 Befouled Water Elementals at Mystral Lake.	Simmer Down Now	You should've seen it, Mechanic! The elves thought Silverwind to be impenetrable. With its heavy defenses and their army of water elementals, they were almost right. Almost. One of our mages was able to summon a twisted elemental designed to send the others into a chaotic rage. Ahh, the looks on their faces!<Tarkan laughs.>Unfortunately, the mage who summoned it fell in battle. Now I need someone to bring down our creation. 
	Still Believing	 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar.	Khadgar's Request	Archmage Khadgar arrived while you were away. It seems that he is here to speak with you, George. Hurry and see what it is that he wants. I want him gone as soon as possible. The last thing we need is a human nosing around in Horde business! 
Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of the Venture Co. Overseers or Enforcers.	Miner's Fortune	Hey Human, you interested in treasure? I knew that would get your attention. Word from the river dock here is that one of the miners in the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine just northeast of here discovered an emerald the size of your fist. I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale. You in? 
Bring A-Me's Thumb Drive back to Karna Remtravel at Mossy Pile in Un'Goro Crater.	Serving A-Me 01	Greetings. I unit A-Me 01. You... Human? A-Me's mission to study the local gorillas was success. A-Me has gathered data that Karna needs. A-Me 01 not returning, though. A-Me has new family now. Here, with the gorillas, A-Me stay.<A-Me 01 detaches a small device from her hand and gives it to you.>You bring data back to Karna. You tell her what happen. 
Bring the Moss-twined Heart to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.	The Moss-twined Heart	The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss. In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now. Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart. 
Collect 5 Basilisk Flanks.	Will Work For Food	<Khan Kammah listens as you explain the demonic threat, and Khan Leh'prah's visions.>No one need lecture us about the demons, Human. It is they who drove our clan from our ancestral lands. It is they who forced us to take over the Kolkar wastelands, where we struggle just to exist. The war against the Kolkar took a heavy toll on my people. What few of us remain are weary and hungry. Bring food for my people and then we shall discuss the demons. 
Collect 8 Bileberries.	Seeds of Their Demise	We will decimate the Twilight's Hammer by corrupting and subverting them. Seeing that you have no intention of releasing me from my bonds, I require you to collect some reagents for me. My own demonic essence has corrupted the plant life around my shrine here. I need you to harvest some bileberries from the wailing weeds that surround this tower. My little pets will attempt to harvest YOU in return. Try not to let them agitate one another. 
Use the Reprogrammed Shredder to collect 6 piles of Azshara Lumber. If you lose your shredder, another can be attacked and reprogrammed.	The Captain's Logs	Now that you've got that thing under control, let's gather up the lumber I was supposed to be collecting. Otherwise these orcs are going to build a catapult out of ME! Fresh lumber should be stockpiled all around the area. Use the shredder to collect all you can. 
Use the Heap of Core Hound Innards near Nemesis to distract him. Collect a Nemesis Shell Fragment.	Hell's Shells	Fresh and stinking, these innards will prove to be irresistible for Nemesis, the befouled turtle god created by Twilight's Hammer. Nemesis must eventually be destroyed, but first, we must collect a piece of his fiery armored shell. With it, we'll be able to work some magic to free the true ancient. Go into the Flamewake and drop this bait near Nemesis. It will distract him. Pry off a piece of his shell... then run, if you hope to survive the encounter. 
Kill 10 fleshbeasts in Uldum.	Twisted Corruptors	While the fleshbeasts that accompany the invading forces appear to be no more than a nuisance, they carry within themselves a deep connection to the corrupting powers of the Old Gods. Like a pestilence, they spread the N'Zoth's corruption wherever they tread, slowly twisting the very land to their form. They must be eradicated. 
Collect 8 batches of Cursed Ooze from the Ruins of Constellas.	See the Invisible	Yeah, yeah, your stuck-up mage friend there hit it on the nose. The imps over at Shadowlurk Ridge are hiding the key to the satyr's barrier in the nether. It's right there, but you can't see it or touch it unless you're shifted. I guess you're out of luck though, because only imps can phase shift! So you should just close your eyes, turn around, and let me go...It was just a joke! Don't hurt me! I'll need slime from the cursed oozes around these ruins. Bring me enough to cover you from head to toe! 
Destroy 8 Holdfast Cannons.	Quiet the Cannons	Now it's time to do something about those darn cannons up on the bluffs to the east! If you'd be so kind, hop into your boat and cruise on over to the Southsea Holdfast. Up top you'll see a bunch of cannons firing down on us. Those pirates don't know squat about engineering. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to clog 'em up and make them explode. 
Draaka wants you to bring her Letter of Explanation to Eitrigg in Orgrimmar.	All Apologies	This could be the end of me... Perhaps my actions were not thought out as well as they should have been...The good news is that we pushed back an attack that would have otherwise meant the end of Splintertree. Let us pray that Saurfang sees it that way. I am certain to be summoned to Orgrimmar to explain my actions. Please, George, go ahead of me and present this letter to his advisor Eitrigg. Do what you can to soften his heart towards me. 
Take the Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive to Kayla Mills in Stormwind City.	Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive	The glaive rests inches from the sentinel's outstretched fingertips. Her eyes stare, sightless, at the ashen husk of Teldrassil on the horizon. Perhaps someone in Stormwind can tell you what happened here. 
Equip a Twilight Firelance and fly Aviana's Guardian. Kill 10 Twilight Knight Riders by flying into them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!	Wave One	Here they come, George! The Twilight Knight Riders, astride black buzzards birthed in the scorching sulfurous breeding pools of the Firelands. The only way to defeat them is from the sky! Take wing once more, Mechanic, and slay them. Run into enemy riders with your lance to destroy them. Go forth. Fly, fool. Fly! 
Kill 8 K'thir minions in Uldum.	Dark Deceivers	The Old Gods have many faceless minions at their disposal, but none so deceiving as the ones they call k'thir. Though not nearly as imposing as their brethren, the k'thir manipulate in the shadows, bending the wills of men and even reality itself. We must not allow their machinations to go unchecked. 
Use the Highborne Prison to bind 5 Highborne Spirits.	Arcane Legacy	The rage of the elements has unearthed a hidden Highborne city in the heart of Stonetalon Mountains. Directly southwest of here, through Sishir Canyon, you will find the Ruins of Eldre'thar. Within the ruins lie treasures untouched by mortals for ten thousand years! Take this device and use it on the Highborne ghosts that inhabit the ruins. It will... put their souls to rest and also collect valuable data which I may peruse at a later date. 
Deliver the Apothecary's notes to Tharnariun Treetender in Lor'danel.	A Troubling Prescription	A crude, hastily-assembled apothecary's workbench stands here, heaped with scrawled notes and noxious brews. It looks as though the Forsaken have also been studying Foulhoof's handiwork. You grab the most important-looking notes and prepare to smash the laboratory before notifying Treetender of your discovery. 
Kill a Twilight Field Captain and recover the Glyph of Opening.	The Hammer and the Key	My Nemesis. Still lives. The servants of fire still come. We must pursue. Into their den. The ogres know the way. Slay the Field Captains. Recover the Glyph of Opening. This is the way. 
Obtain Meatface's Chest.	You Too, Brute?	It's time to conclude this matter efficiently. From what we've determined, this mysterious object is in the possession of the ""smart"" brute described in the journal. We don't know exactly what's happened to this creature, obviously, so you should take caution. This... ""Meatface"" is hiding in the hills, near where these goblins bury their dead. Look for the graveyard and he should be just past it. 
Obtain Fizzle's Orb from Fizzle Darkclaw in Thunder Ridge.	Fizzled	The flood to the southwest wiped out one of the few Burning Blade camps that still pockmark Durotar. This one was led by a goblin named Fizzle Darkclaw, and believe me, we're better off without him. Darkclaw, however, did possess an orb that the Horde is interested in procuring. Who knows why... I leave that to the warlocks. All I know is that I need that orb. 
Retrieve 2 Nightsaber Fangs, 2 Strigid Owl Feathers and 2 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk.	Zenn's Bidding	Eager for work, I see. Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling Mechanic to perform my bidding. You see, George, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having. But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items. My business in the forest often requires certain... reagents. Fetch for me nightsaber fangs, strigid owl feathers and swatches of webwood spider silk. Let's keep this our little secret, Human. 
Collect 7 Ancient Copper Scrolls.	Missing Pieces	There are just a few specific pieces of information that I'm missing. Once those blanks are filled, we'll be ready to activate the final obelisk. Then, it'll be a race to discover the Coffer of Promise before Schnottz and his cronies can. Those fools are excavating this site as fast as they can. They're ruining more than they're looting! Go to the obelisk and rummage through their booty, George. See if you can find our missing pieces. 
Gather 20 ingots of Mountainfoot Iron from the Mountainfoot Strip Mine in Azshara.	A Quota to Meet	Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets goblin safety standards. Zignibble here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill! Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment. 
Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus.	Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie	Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers! What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me. 
Collect 7 Moonpetal Lilies.	Iverron's Antidote	Our friend Iverron has fallen to poison from the nearby webwood spiders. I can tend to him to keep his state from deteriorating, but I need someone to gather an ingredient to prepare him an antidote. All around the ponds you should find Moonpetal Lilies. These flowers have great healing properties, and I can use them with the ingredients I already have to restore Iverron to better health. Would you gather them for me? There should be many just in sight of here, near the water's edge. 
Use the stealth field generator to infiltrate the Ruins of Eldarath and identify the Heart of Arkkoroc.	Profitability Scouting	Things seem to be quieting down a bit. Gallywix will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted here, but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal. Naga and Sea Giants aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey. 
Slay Umbranse the Spiritspeaker.	Umbranse's Deliverance	Umbranse lurks in the back of Mazthoril. His time has come. Unfortunately, I am unable to join you on this quest. While I'd love to get my hands on that snake, Mazthoril's magic would rip me apart in its current state. No, I need you to finish this for me. When the deed is done, use this charm. It will return you safely to the egress. 
Bring Deathclasp's Pincer to Vish Kozus, Captain of the Guard.	Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands	The terrible scorpid, Deathclasp, is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased silithid activity. She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions. Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely. Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the Cenarion Hold Watchtower, regarding a reward. 
Question Frankal and Rutgar at Bronzebeard's Encampment about the whereabouts of Natalia Mar'alith.	Dearest Natalia	My dear Natalia has gone missing. Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research. She was last seen heading to Bronzebeard's camp to the south. My soldiers are spread too thin, George. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves. 
Collect 6 Duneclaw Stingers from Duneclaw Scorpids.	I'm With Scorpid	You gotta help me, you just gotta! Chelsea and I came out here to make a bit of money, just sell some supplies, legit work. Next thing I know she's on her deathbed! She's got a fever that'd shock a blacksmith, and she's hallucinating...She must've been stung by the scorpids near here! I've seen it happen, it's not pretty. I gotta get some poison glands to make an antidote but I can't leave her side! Please, help me! Get me those glands! 
Report to Nura Pathfinder at the High Road in the Southern Barrens. Optionally, grab a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Southern Barrens!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Nura Pathfinder at the High Road in the Southern Barrens. With the recent Alliance victories in the Barrens, our enemies are threatening to cut our supply lines and leave our warriors stranded. We must act! To reach the High Road, travel east from Stonetalon Mountains. If necessary, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar. Destiny calls! 
Kill 12 Mangy Hyenas.	Do the World a Favor	Hyenas, on their best day, are a nuisance. These foul specimens have a particularly nasty disposition, are riddled with all manner of disease, and are simply a blight on the face of dogdom. Do the world a favor and rid the deserts of Uldum of this mangy menace. 
Speak with Halannia to summon the Shade of Shadumbra and use its power to destroy any 50 Warsong enemies at Raynewood Retreat.	Defend the Tree!	We have been using the power of the Forest Heart to defend the tree from the Horde, but its power is not without limit. We must use it to take the fight to them! Shadumbra, the great cat of the forest, prowls nearby. It is from her that we shall draw our inspiration. You will become one with the shade of Shadumbra. You will take the essence of the panther into you and lay waste to those who dare attack the might of Ashenvale! 
Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket. Talk to Brak to teleport directly to her.	Wenikee Boltbucket	I think I really put my foot into that one - it looks like I might have knocked one of the load-bearing fluxors into the spokes of the deregulator gear. We can fix this, easy. I know an expert on triple-expansion piston drives who would love to get her hands on a samophlange. Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, she'll patch 'er right up. Hey, no need to walk - this gives me the perfect opportunity to test my personal people porter device! 
Discover the location of the Western Crystal Pylon.	The Western Pylon	Durrin's research touched on one area that intrigues me: a potential link between the titans and the dinosaurs. J.D. Collie back at camp is always talking about titan this and crystal that... maybe she'd be interested. Before you report to her, you might want to check out the crystal pylon not far from here. It's just up in the cliffs, to the west of here. It's got crystals on it, and it always seemed to me like it might have something to do with the titans. 
Bring 'Efficient Excavations' to Belloc Brightblade in Schnottz's Landing.	Efficient Excavations	This manual describes outlandish theories on how to most efficiently manage large groups of workers as they engage in massive excavation projects. After a quick skim of the material, it becomes clear to you that the author of the book is the figure in charge of the over-aggressive pillagers here. A map on the back cover indicates that the author has a bunker in the southwest region of Uldum. Perhaps an introduction is in order. 
Speak with Krog at Brackenwall Village.	Return to Krog	I hope I've been helpful to you and I'm sorry I can't offer more information. My apprentices and I produce such a large volume of arms and armor that it's almost impossible to recall details about any individual piece. Not only do we outfit the braves defending tauren lands, but the Grimtotems have a particular fondness for my work. A seasoned warrior knows good work when he sees it. 
Bring 6 Moongraze Stag Tenderloins to Acteon at Azure Watch.	The Great Moongraze Hunt	You're starting to make a name for yourself, George. How about trying your hand at hunting? Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk. If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat. You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns! 
Challenge Gromm'ko at the Seat of the Chosen in Hyjal.	Grudge Match	I don't know if you've picked up on this, but there's a bit of a rivalry between the ogre members of the Twilight's Hammer and the rest of us. For me... it's personal. This one ogre called Gromm'ko has a pet raptor named ""Butcher."" He's taken out the last three of my corehound pups. I think this last one will fare differently. He's got a real killer's instinct. Go to the Seat of the Chosen and challenge Gromm'ko to a match between our two beasts. Humiliate him for me, Georgedamus. 
Locate Choluna at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal.	Aviana's Legacy	Your expertise is needed elsewhere, George. Just southwest of the World Tree you will find the Shrine of Aviana, home to the Druids of the Talon. Aviana, the matron of all winged creatures, gave her life for this world ten thousand years ago. I sense her shrine is being threatened, as are the druids who guard it. Seek out Choluna, one of the wisest of the winged druids, deep within the shrine. 
Obtain 6 pieces of Smoked Meat from either Winterfall furbolg camp in Winterspring and feed them to your Winterspring Cub.	'Borrowing' From the Winterfall	Your cub looks at you expectantly. What could it want now? The little cat licks its lips. It must be meal time again! As the cub's surrogate <father/mother> you're responsible for providing meat until it can hunt on its own. But what if you let someone else do the hunting? The Winterfall furbolg of Winterspring usually have a lot of smoked meat on hand in both of their camps. Surely, they wouldn't miss a few pieces and your cub would get to try something new. 
Explore the Chamber of the Stars.	The Thrill of Discovery	What a find! And somehow it's all remained untouched by plunderers...Listen, George. I need to document this site before we disturb anything. While I do, why don't you have a look around - you know, explore a bit. You've earned it. Keep your eyes open for anything unusual. Oh! And please... don't break anything, ok? 
Commander Schnottz wants you to collect 8 Well-preserved Idols.	Idolatry	Zhere is somezhink I need handled, Human. My most trusted advisor has run afoul of an ancient curse. A hex zhat has transformed zhe man into a turkey, of all zhings! I haff studied for days to discover a remedy for his condition, and finally I am ready to conduct zhe ritual. I vill reqvire several idols from zhe nearby ruins. You are to brink zhem to me at vonce! Dismissed! 
Obtain the Spiked Basilisk Hide from the Spinescale Matriarch.	A Champion's Collar	This little guy is a true menace now, isn't he? We're going to have to give him a nice spiked collar if he's going to be a fighting pup. The basilisk matriarch has made her lair off of the road to Winterspring. Bring me her spiked hide and we'll fashion a collar for our little killer here. 
Return to Choluna at the Shrine of Aviana in Mount Hyjal.	Return to the Shrine	Aviana's Egg should have arrived safely back at the Shrine. You should go check on it! Choluna should know how to handle this. I'll finish the last of our business here and catch up with you later. 
Arm 8 Krom'gar ""Elf Killers.""	Barrier to Entry	Filthy, good-for-nothin' night elves have managed to disarm our entire minefield in Talondeep Pass. Somebody is gonna have to go back up there and re-arm them all! A perfect task for a worthless grunt like you, George. Here's to hopin' you don't blow yourself up in the process. You'll find our ""Elf Killers"" scattered across Talondeep Pass, directly north of here. Take this wrench and get to work, maggot. 
Travel through the flamegate in the Scorched Plain and locate Garunda Mountainpeak within.	The Third Flamegate	Memorize the glyph. Take it within yourself. Draw it on the ground before the flamegate. East of here. Enter the Firelands. I cannot come with you. But my children await. Inside. Find Garunda Mountainpeak within the realm of flame. 
Deliver the Alliance Attack Plans to Overlord Krom'gar at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains.	Krom'gar Fortress	Our main base of operations in Stonetalon Mountains is Krom'gar Fortress. It is from there that Overlord Krom'gar oversees all Horde military activity in the region. Krom'gar reports everything that happens directly to the Warchief. The attack plans you brought back detail an assault that's supposed to take place against Krom'gar Fortress soon. Take the plans and head to the fortress, southwest of here. Give them to the Overlord. So long, George. Truly, Hellscream's eyes are upon you. 
Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from Irontree Cavern.	A Bomb Deal	All my workers got driven straight out of the cavern here by those big swamp-lookin' things! Darla's sent me here to pick up the pieces, but have you seen it in there? I ain't goin' in! There's a ton of explosives left behind that we can't just leave layin' around. I'll make you a deal: You run in there and get those explosives gathered up, and I will stay here and not get killed by swamp-things, and if you don't either, I'll pay ya! How's that sound? 
Return the pamphlet to Kar Stormsinger at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore.	Learn to Ride in Mulgore	This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Kar Stormsinger. Kar can be found in Mulgore's Bloodhoof Village. 
Pursue and slay the Shade of the Spiritspeaker and obtain any evidence of its master.	In Pursuit of Shades	You say it spoke of a master? Of one who holds Zin-Malor? This is grave news. You must act, Mechanic! I saw the shade fly off to the south. Take the path to the upper ruins, and you may be able to climb the frozen waterfall after it! And do not let your guard down... it may be waiting for you. 
Speak with Deez Rocksnitch.	Hammer Time	The three of us have been arguing for weeks over whose weapons are superior. I won't let anyone tell me my maces are second best. Kilram's axes and Seril's swords could never match the pure strength of my craft. I'm tired of arguing. It's time to show those two I'm right with a demonstration. If you would, dear, head outside and tell Deez Rocksnitch that I need the biggest boulder he can find! 
Slay Hell-Hoot.	A Bird of Legend	Local legend tells of a mighty owl that circles the mountaintops like death on wings. They named her Deathwing. Soon afterwards, they were told that that name was already taken. So they settled on a moniker that evoked a similar sense of horror and dread:Hell-Hoot. Hell-Hoot can be found atop the mountain to the southwest of our smoking pit. Silence the infernal nocturnal... so we can eat her! 
Kill 15 Southsea Pirates.	Dead Man's Chest	Well gosh, as you can plainly see there's this really big battle with these pirates here going on. We're doing our best to make sure they never bother Gadgetzan or our new gnomish homes there ever again! By killing them. So how about helping us? We really wanna make sure we kill more than green-nose over there and her awful thugs. I'd really appreciate it! 
Disturb 8 Ritual Gems.	Stopping the Rituals	I could not help but overhear Illiyana's loss. I understand her need for revenge. I am wondering if while you are exacting it, you could do us a service? No doubt you have already seen the satyr of Satyrnaar and Xavian conducting vile rituals. I believe that they are preparing their rituals to corrupt any of the night elves they capture, turning them into satyrs. We draenei also have problems with fel magic exposure. Would you disturb their ritual gems while you are there? 
Escort ""Stinky"" Ignatz, then speak with Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.	Stinky's Escape	Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!!I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something... I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am. Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean! Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant? 
Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Vindicator Vedaar at the Warsong Lumber Camp in Ashenvale.	Diabolical Plans	The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Common tongue! The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Forest Song to the north, the location where a new draenei settlement is being established. Perhaps Vindicator Vedaar at the Warsong Lumber Camp would be interested in these? 
Collect 10 Aloe Thistles.	A Time to Reap	No one knows better than the Cenarion Circle that this lush oasis could dry up as quickly as it appeared. We must take care not to interfere with the processes taking place here, but to support and preserve them,A new species of plant, very plentiful in the surrounding region, has appeared since the great change. Collect samples of these for me, that I might study them and learn what they have to teach us, 
Return Gurf's Dignity to Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle.	Gurf's Dignity	You recover the piece of fur that Gurf had ""lost"" in his struggle with the murlocs. Return the fur to Gurf and let him know that the fearsome Murgurgula has been slain. 
Collect 10 Thick Yeti Hides.	The Mark of Quality	I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets! In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides. Yetis are native to Feralas, often found north of here in Rage Scar Hold. I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten. If that is agreeable to you, then we are set! 
Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Moonstalker Spirit.	Spirit of the Moonstalker	In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them. If you wish to align yourself with the Great Moonstalker Spirit, take this incense to the land just south of the Ruins of Lornesta. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me. 
Obtain Elune's Torch from Horoo the Flamekeeper.	Elune's Fire	We need special flame for ritual. We need Elune's fire. Horoo's spirit wanders east of here. Horoo carries torch of Elune. Bring here so spirits rest. Aroom thanks you. 
Recover 6 Fuming Toadstools.	Unsavory Remedies	I have no doubts that Grimclaw will recover with the help of my healing magics, though I can't say the same for the poachers that attacked him. Still, I could use some salve to close his wounds and lessen his pain while he heals. To the east you will find the Ruins of Lornesta. Among the crumbled stones, there is a variety of fuming toadstool that flourishes in the damp environment. Bring me some of the toadstools so that I can mix a salve for our friend here. 
Find Elder Sareth'na's Sketch Book.	Seen Better Days	The world is unraveling around us, George. Old enemies seek to destroy us from one end, while ancient forces close in on the other.<Elder Sareth'na sighs.>I have seen better days - brighter days, and I long for them...Across Stonetalon Peak lies the ruins of our old outpost - now overrun with darkness. If you happen to go that way, could you search for my sketch book? It holds many happy memories. I would reward you well for its return. 
Defeat the Vil'thik Hatchling in a pet battle with your Shadowbarb Hatchling in your party.	The Mantids' Mettle	Observing the combat techniques of the mantid may prove helpful for our hatchling's training, offering a different way to use the natural weapons of an insect. I have found a mantid opponent that our hatchling could face in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Take him there and see how he does. 
Use the Swiftwind Switch to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps.	Wisps of the Woods	I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing. But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy! Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe. 
Speak to High Commander Kamses at the Ramkahen Legion Outpost in Uldum.	The High Commander's Vote	If we're to pass a resolution for war, the high council's vote needs to be unanimous. I'm certain High Commander Kamses will give us his vote once he hears about what happened at Orsis. Please speak to him in Ramkahen and make sure that's the case. I must make preparations in case our plan fails. 
Speak to Spraggle Frock in Marshal's Stand.	Speak With Spraggle	My good friend Spraggle has been fretting about something for some time now. I'd help her, but as you can see, I'm pretty comfortable right now. Could you check in with her and see what she needs? 
Slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet.	Lieutenants of Darkness	The armies of Ramkahen are getting obliterated by Neferset's immortal guardians. The only way to defeat them is to slay the Dark Pharaoh of Neferset. Before we make our move, however, we're going to need to take care of his lieutenants. Go behind the battle-lines and slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet. Only then will we be ready to confront the Dark Pharaoh himself. 
Collect 7 Cenarion Supply Crates from the Magram Lands.	Cenarion Property	Since the demons have invaded their lands, the Magram have broken all ties with any outsiders. They are untrusting and hostile and have taken to stealing from others instead of providing for themselves. Many of our needed supplies have gone missing of late and we suspect that the Magram are to blame. Please, George, go to their lands in the east and search for our belongings. 
Defeat Stinglasher in the Writhing Deep, bringing its glands back to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas.	Stinglasher	In surveying the Writhing Deep, one of our scouts reported seeing a giant insect - much larger than the other insects spotted - wandering about the twisted terrain. Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't. We've given it a name - Stinglasher. The innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat. Cut out its secretion glands and bring it back to me immediately! 
Speak with Tabetha at her farm.	Tabetha's Assistance	I can't spare any men to help search for a second Grimtotem outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you. Deep in the Quagmire, to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha. She may seem little more than an old hermit, but the truth is that she's a mage and scryer of some renown. Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the Shady Rest Inn. 
Speak to Aroom at the Moontouched Den north of the Eye of the Vortex.	The Last Wildkin	The wildkin were once numerous in Darkshore. Such are their ties to the land that the Cataclysm that shattered Darkshore also decimated their numbers. The wildkin Aroom is the last of his tribe and is a powerful elder with a strong connection to Elune. His help will be most necessary in healing the land -- you will find him north of here at the Moontouched Den. 
Kill 8 Honor's Stand Footmen and 1 Honor's Stand Officer.	Put the Fear in Them	Do you see the trail below us, George? That is MY trail. And if the Alliance dogs choose to use my trail, they'd best be looking over their shoulder. It's time to collect my toll! Slay the footsoldiers from Honor's Stand and see if we can't send them scurrying back to their walls. Be sure to take out at least one of their officers patrolling the road. They need to realize that nobody is safe. 
Use the Drums of the Soothed Earth to calm 6 Agitated Earth Spirits.	The Restless Earth	Until recently, a group of dwarves intruded on our lands to the west, carving the earth apart senselessly to search for treasure. When the very earth itself tore apart, the spirits of the land they had abused rose up and took their revenge. The agitated earth spirits still roam the former dig site, George. We must offer them appeasement. Take this drum with you to the west and play to the spirits. The rhythm may calm their fury and confusion. 
Bring the Box of Bugkill Fumigators to Sana Curtainfire in the Ban'Thallow Barrow Den.	Spray it One More Time	You'd think Rinno could have sent more than a single Human down here to give us a hand! That freeloader...I'm gonna set this up. Head north from this room through the corridor and look for Sana. She's probably gotten herself lost in the last chamber, so check the side passages once you get there. 
Slay Zhevra Runners to collect 4 Zhevra Hooves.	The Zhevra	If you wish to serve my beloved horde, you'll have to prove your strength to me, pup. You can cut your teeth by hunting zhevra. They may not be the strongest of beasts in the Barrens, but stay clear of their kick or you'll regret it. Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves. Bring them to me and perhaps we'll next send you against something tougher. 
Speak with Riznek at the Splithoof Heights in Thousand Needles.	Negotiations	George, great job defending the Speedbarge! I've got something else that I need you to help out with. I've sent Riznek and Trackmaster Zherin northeast to negotiate with the centaur survivors. Their Splithoof Heights is dripping with oil! I figure those smelly half horses won't know what they've got and we'll get the rights to pump up that black gold for a song, but I'd feel better if you took charge of the talks. What do you say? 
Slay Grundig Darkcloud.	Grimtotem Chiefs: Grundig Darkcloud	One of the infamous Grimtotem leaders of the Stonetalon Mountains has returned home. We should take this opportunity to make sure that he doesn't go anywhere else. 
Assassinate Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion.	Behind You!	The three leaders of the Bulwark are powerful and not to be underestimated, George. Fortunately for us, you now have a disguise to make you look like one of the Twilight cultists. You should put the disguise on and speak with Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion each alone. Get them to turn their backs on you, and when they do, strike quickly! 
Ride the ship from Booty Bay to Ratchet, then speak with Gazlowe.	The Call of Kalimdor	I've been sent by the good people of Theramore to find loyal members of the Alliance who are willing to help Lady Jaina with some problems in Dustwallow. You weren't really here working for the goblins, were you? The path back to Dustwallow will take you through Ratchet. Wait on the end of this pier for the next boat. Once you get to Ratchet, speak with Gazlowe. He'll point you in the right direction from there. Ugh, I think I stepped on a fish! And it flopped! 
Return to Ian Duran at the reclaimed Shrine of Goldrinn in Hyjal.	The Shrine Reclaimed	Yes George, I am Goldrinn. Your persistence in the face of fear has unbound me from twilight's grasp. My shrine has been purified, and my worshippers have returned to their rightful place at my right paw. Return to Ian and continue your work here in Hyjal. I will have need of you again soon. 
Bring 12 pieces of Light Leather to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff.	Gathering Leather	Greetings, young one. You have a gleam in your eye; I can tell you are eager to venture back to the plains for the hunt. May you bring honor to your clan! I work with the skins of beasts, fashioning them into clothes and armor for the people of Thunder Bluff. If you hunt beasts and bring me their skins, then I will fashion something for you. 
Kill Sheya Stormweaver and Lorenth Thundercall.	Strategic Strikes	Striking at the head of the beast doesn't work if there's another head to replace it. Before we can kill their leader, we need to kill the subleaders that may try to step up. Right now, they are not as well defended, and you should be able to best them without much support. Take this dryad spear and hunt them down. The poison on its tip should slow their incantations. My scouts reported one inside the water chamber in the ruins to the east and the other past the remains of the tower to the southwest. 
Go into the Inferno and rescue any combination of 10 Panicked Bunnies or Terrified Squirrels.	Save the Wee Animals	Help us, Mechanic! The forest is aflame, and the wee animals can't find their way out. They can't fight for themselves, with their teeny-tiny little teeth and their soft furry paws! They're fluffy and sweet. They have wet little noses! If you don't save them, I don't want to even THINK about it.<She slaps her palms over her eyes.>I'm not thinking! 
Kill Master Assassin Kel'istra.	Is This Thing On?	<The Gnomecorder crackles with energy. You can hear Lieutenant Paulson on the other end.>Stupid gnome junk... Is ANYBODY there? George, are you there? Maybe <he's/she's> dead. Listen, if you can still hear me, we just got word that a Horde master assassin is in the mines, directing the other assassins. Find her, kill her, report back to me. Paulson, out. 
Kill 6 Consumed Thistle Bears and investigate the lake they're drinking from.	Consumed	My first concern right now is for the thistle bear families who call what's left of these woods home. Just to our south, beyond the bear shrine, an entire generation has fallen ill. Gruesomely ill. George, I don't know what they're suffering from, but it's consumed them from within. It pains me that a whole generation is beyond saving, but we've got to kill them off so that the earth can reclaim their bodies. More importantly, we need to find the source. Investigate the shallow lake they drink from! 
Step through the flamegate atop the Lightning Ledge in Mount Hyjal, and speak with Jordan Olafson within.	Into the Maw!	Atop the Lightning Ledge, the Twilight's Hammer has erected an enormous flamegate. I do not know where it leads; I know it is not of this realm, and I cannot enter. None of my other followers have returned. I need you to enter this realm and be my fangs within. Step through the flamegate. If he is still alive, meet with Jordan Olafson inside. He will give you a token that will allow you to use my powers in that realm. Be bold, George. Find out where that flamegate leads, and destroy whatever lies within. 
Kill the Horde generals at Camp Aparaje and recover the Insignia of the Horde General.	Downfall	By the time that we received word that Hellscream had sent another mag'har orc to oversee the Horde troops in southern Stonetalon, it was too late. Camp Aparaje was burned to the ground and all Grimtotem in the area incinerated. Now the Horde have four of their most fearsome generals commanding the battle for Greatwood Vale, including the mag'har, General Glubgok. You must travel to the ruins of Camp Aparaje, south of here, and kill the generals. We stop the Horde NOW! Return to me with their mark! 
Speak to Malfurion at the Eye of the Vortex in Darkshore.	Leaving the Dream	Hold on tight, George. The journey back to the waking world can be a little rough on unprepared minds and bodies. 
Collect 1 Blazing Heart of Fire.	World First: Gnomegen	Good day, citizen, allow me to introduce myself. I am Salsbury, soon to be the world's first gnomegen. Malyk has assured me that as soon as my work here is complete he will grant me the gift of the worgen. So with the introduction out of the way, I've a request! Within the Charred Vale, south of here, roam newly created fire elementals. I desperately need a rare blazing heart of fire from one of the fiends. Get it for me and you bring me one step closer to becoming a gnomegen! 
Kill Githyiss the Vile at the northen end of the Shadowthread Cave.	Vile Touch	If these spiders are born with corruption in their veins, then their broodmother must be at the root of this evil. Let us make our way to the far north end of the cave and seek out Githyiss the Vile. The answers we seek lie with her. 
Kill any 6 Pridewing Wyvern.	The Turd Problem	We have a little problem...<Jibbly points to the large turds covering the base.>We built the Sludgewerks near a wyvern habitat. Now our initial blueprints for the Sludgewerks were drawn up so as not to disturb the wyvern habitat as the beasts are apparently sacred to tauren and orcs. Do you know what's sacred to me? Not getting pooped on, that's what! Between you, me and the wall, the wyvern must die! 
Meet with Zabrax in the Darkspear Training Grounds.	The Rise of the Darkspear	Tha Darkspear tribe have long been victims. Outcasts. We found ourselves fleein' our homes time 'n time again... but dis time, it's not fleein' dat drives us here. Vol'jin has offered us leadership through wisdom, and it has kept us alive dis long. Now dat same wisdom offers portents of a chaotic future for tha Horde unda Garrosh Hellscream. No, dis time we not fleein'. Dis time, we are fightin' for a home dat will last. It's time to begin ya trainin', George. Speak with Zabrax to the east. 
Slay Whrrrl.	Go Blow that Horn	That old, bitter centaur, Skycaller Vrakthris, mentioned a great air spirit that the centaur worship. To secure the Heights, the last step is for us to deal with this thing. I've seen them blow the giant horn at the top of the hill up there and an air elemental came down. It gave them orders and then dissipated. Go blow that horn, George. 
Collect the Writ of History.	The Writ of History	The Rattle of Bones is a part of shu'halo ancient myth. It is always connected with the Writ of History and the Drums of War. They are supposed to be powerful tauren artifacts; gifts from the Earth Mother if the tales are to be believed. I cannot imagine Her being connected with the drums, though. We must be vigilant if we are to find the other two. The writ will look like a pictographic scroll if memory serves. 
Obtain the Stone of the Moon and the Stone of the Sun from the Colossal Guardians.	Colossal Guardians	The chest containing the scepter appears to be magically sealed and will not budge. The plaque above it depicts two giant statues holding star and moon-shaped stones sockets at their center. The two statues are pictured guarding pyramids that look like the ones outside. Perhaps it's worth your while to investigate these. 
Kill 8 Sunscale Ravagers, 4 Sunscale Scytheclaws, and locate the Stolen Silver.	The Stolen Silver	It's clear that these raptors acted alone to steal the Horde's silver. It's time to teach these beasts a lesson. 
Find the Glowing Gem.	The Lost Gem	As you rummage through Teronis' belongings, you find a water-damaged journal. Quickly flipping through the last legible pages, you read that Teronis makes mention of finding the gem, but then of having lost it in the Falathim area. The only thing left to do is find it. Perhaps the tendrils have it...? 
Escape the Ruins of Gilneas with Arthura and the corpse of Lord Godfrey.	The Great Escape	With our mission objective secured, the time has come for us to make our escape. Though Gilneas is lost, with the aid of Godfrey and his lieutenants we will have it back in no time at all. Go now, George. Fly back with Arthura to the Forsaken Front in southern Silverpine Forest. The Banshee Queen awaits your arrival. 
Slay Dark Pharaoh Tekahn at Neferset City in Uldum.	The Fall of Neferset City	We are ready to strike now, George. If we take down Dark Pharaoh Tekahn, the immortal colossi will fall and our armies will be able to march into Neferset City. Seek him out and engage him without fear. I will make sure you're not alone when it's time to bring him down. 
Kill 4 Twilight Flamecallers and 10 Twilight Vanquishers.	War on the Twilight's Hammer	Make no mistake about this, George. The outcome of this war will determine the very survival of our world as we know it. The Twilight's Hammer has become more powerful than ever with Deathwing's return. Should they succeed in taking over the World Tree, they might strike a blow from which we will never recover. It is time we beat back the enemy. It is time we crushed the Twilight's Hammer. 
Bring 8 stalks of Bear's Paw to Elder Brolg at Blackwood Hold.	The Bear's Paw	The foul satyr of Felwood have started to introduce their poison into Darkshore, into our lands. Their corruption kills the land and twists the creatures who live in it. My people are no exception. Our magic alone is not enough to bring them back to their senses. There is an herb, called bear's paw, that we use to break fevers and fortify the weak. With its help, we may be able to break the influence of the satyr. The herb grows in the wilds around the village. 
Collect 4 Grimtotem Notes from Grimtotem Elders and combine them into the Grimtotem Battle Plan.	Confirming the Suspicion	The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders. There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek. 
Bring the Flourishing Protector back to the hill in the center of Irontree Woods.	Rejoining the Forest	It is time to say goodbye now. You have raised me from a seedling, brief though it was, but now I must rejoin the forest. Take me back to the hill you found me on. There I will set my roots, and grow in the shadow of the ancients that came before me. 
Obtain Icewhomp's Pristine Horns.	The Perfect Horns	I can't make a yeti without horns! I've been looking for what seems like forever for the perfect set of horns... and no horn I find is good enough! But just the other day I saw the biggest yeti in Winterspring. I named him Icewhomp. His horns are the ones I've been looking for! He lurks all the way in the back of the cave along the eastern ridge of Ice Thistle Hills. Bring me his horns... but be sure to check on Echo Three along the way! 
Obtain 7 Winterwater from Ice Avatars in Frostwhisper Gorge.	Winterwater	I don't want our gambit to fail, George. Such a failure would only draw attention to our efforts, giving Umbranse an opportunity to hone his defenses. No, we have to do this right the first time. The Frostwhisper Gorge, to the south, provides us access to powerful ice elementals. The water within these elementals' hulls should amplify the power of your dreamcatcher, ensuring our efforts. Obtain this water, George. Then return to our small camp. 
Report to Nymn at Everlook in Winterspring.	Trailing the Spiritspeaker	I have heard tales of Umbranse, though I have not ever met him in person. Rumor has it that he's been collecting magical artifacts, though for what purpose, I couldn't say. Best pass this information on to a trusted ally. Nymn, the high elf, can be found within Everlook, the large goblin town to the northeast. Tell him all that we learned today. 
Destroy 3 Northwatch Supply Crates and kill 10 Northwatch Lugs.	Breaking the Chain	Aw man, this ain't good. Not one bit, mon. Thrall's off to sea, Vol'jin's taking care of business in Echo Isles, and old Master Gadrin is left behind to take care of Sen'jin. And then what happens? Those humans come outta Northwatch Hold and set up camp in our backyard! Lucky for us, they just got here, and they're still setting up their base. You can help out old Gadrin by destroying those big supply crates they carry, and by killing the laborers carryin' them. You'll find'm to the southwest. 
Deliver the Sanctified Moonstones to Pelturas Whitemoon at Astranaar in Ashenvale.	All's Well	Thank you for saving me from a fate worse than death, George! For saving both the child and myself! Well, the child is almost saved. All you have to do is take the moonstones back west down the road to Astranaar. Hand them to Pelturas and he will know what to do. Go in peace, my friend. Elune be praised! 
Obtain 96 Silithid Legs.	Peculiar Delicacies	Hey <bub/sweetie>, interested in making an extra dime? I've got it on good authority that some interested parties are paying BIG money for silithid legs. Yes, you heard me right, silithid legs! Apparently these things are delicious if you cook them right. They're like underground lobsters, and they live just south of here. Thing is, I'll need a good amount of them to pay for my overhead. Think you could get me 8 dozen or so? 
Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.	Help for Mudsprocket	When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... Moxie, that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the zeppelin wreck, she said the town of Mudsprocket was having some problems. That crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south from here, past the Stonemaul Ruins, you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket. Why don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help? 
Find Teronis at Lake Falathim in Ashenvale.	Finding Teronis	A friend of mine from Astranaar, Raene Wolfrunner, asked me to send a scout west to Lake Falathim. Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked. He was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard. Before he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod. Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force. Please, George, find my friend. 
Report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand in Un'Goro Crater.	Tropical Paradise Beckons	Hey, you look like a discriminating adventurer. Are you looking for something different? Something exotic? Something... profitable? Well shake the sand out of your boots, because I've got a proposition for you. Williden Marshal is looking for competent sellswords such as yourself. He's set up camp at Marshal's Stand, just southeast of the volcano in the center of lush Un'Goro Crater. Then again, paradise isn't for everyone, Human. It's up to you. Your tropical oasis awaits. 
Go with Ogron to speak with Reethe.	Questioning Reethe	It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human. Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him. 
Find Ogron to the southeast of Brackenwall Village.	Talk to Ogron	I know this human, Paval Reethe. Pathetic, even for his kind. He deserted his fellow soldiers and is now hiding out in the woods. I sent Ogron out to track him down. Some of the others suspect he's been stealing from our supplies. I think I saw Ogron heading off to the southeast. 
Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing wants you to recover the Nautical Compass and Nautical Map stolen by the Venture Co.	A Small Start	I am Admiral Odesyus of Alliance Naval Command. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but goblins somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships. Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck! Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship! They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture. 
Slay 10 Raging Firestorms within the Inferno.	Fighting Fire With ... Anything	The inferno raging up ahead marks the front line between us and the forces of the Fire Lord. The fire elementals unleashed here are unlike any I've ever encountered. Can you help us stem the tide of destruction? Slay the raging firestorms... before they engulf Aessina's Grove and erase all hope of someday reclaiming this mountain! 
Convince Azuregos to return to the world of the living and rendezvous with Kalecgos.	Easy is Boring	After a long search with some questionable turns, you've finally found Azuregos. Now it's just a matter of convincing him to meet up with Kalecgos and put an end to the threat of the black dragonflight in Azshara. 
Gather 8 Twilight Armor Plates.	A Gap in Their Armor	Do you see what they're doing here? They're affixing armored plates onto the Dragonkin. A page out of Deathwing's book, I suppose. Those Twilight Juggernauts look like they'll be invincible once they're complete. There's got to be a way around that armor plating! Run out there and fetch some of the Twilight armor plates that are waiting to be installed. We'll figure out how to beat this. 
Return to Balren of the Claw at the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore.	Naga In Our Midst	The creature appears to have had its skull broken in a fight with Aros. It looks like what you've heard described as a naga before. It is said that despite their monstrous features, naga are night elves warped by the arcane magic of Queen Azshara. It seems they've decided to stop you from obtaining the horn of the ancients. 
Use the Totem of Tortolla and the help of a Child of Tortolla to defeat Nemesis. See Garunda Mountainpeak if you lose your turtle companion.	Finish Nemesis	Your turtle companion can use this newfound power to render the two of you invulnerable for a short period of time. You can ""turtle up"" to avoid the worst of Nemesis and his fury. To do so, simply invoke this totem. This is all I can do for you. Together, you and a Child of Tortolla must defeat Nemesis, once and for all. Finish the Usurper! Return to me if you lose your turtle friend. 
Shut off the Master Control Pump at the bottom of Irontree Cavern.	Turn It Off! Turn It Off!	It was those darn worgen! They blew right past me into the cavern. They must've messed with the Master Control Pump! If that thing is left on too long, every pipe runnin' under our feet is gonna blow. You think the leaks now are bad? Just wait! Listen, if you can reach the Master Control Pump all the way in the back of the cavern, you can shut it off and save us all! 
Deliver the Super-Gro Insta-Tree to Kilram at the inn in Everlook.	Tree Delivery	Here you go, one instant Super-Gro Insta-Tree made with 80% natural ingredients! No roots, no muss, no fuss. Just give it to Kilram and make sure he stands the heck back when he uses it. 
Collect 4 Fresh Stormsnout Steaks by killing Stormsnouts in Southern Barrens.	Marching On Our Stomachs	It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way. I'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks. Stormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except... Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you? 
Kill 10 Crazed Survivors.	"Define ""Crazy"""	We received reports that a goblin shipwreck occured on this beach some time ago, with the survivors left to fend for themselves. We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation. What we found was a crew of Bilgewater goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent...to further degrees than is normally observed, rather. In short, they are useless and dangerous. Gnomeregan will be best served by cutting down as many as we can. 
Speak to the Taurajo Looters in the Taurajo Ruins and place them under arrest. Use the Northwatch Manacles to subdue 5 wounded looters.	Clap 'Em In Irons	Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the Stormwind Stockades has come back to haunt us, George. Some of my less-scrupulous soldiers broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city. This is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace. Take these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them. 
Retrieve Michiel Voidstrider's head.	The Twilight Survivor	Silithus used to be overrun with members of the Twilight's Hammer. The cult was presumed to be exterminated, but it has always survived in the shadows. Their numbers have dwindled, but the cult remains no less fanatical than at their peak. Most of the cultists here were destroyed by Sargeras in the attack, but a few still remain. Their leader, Michiel Voidstrider has been emboldened by the destruction of Silithus. We cannot let Michiel rally the remaining survivors to action. He must be stopped! 
Accompany Harrison Jones to the Chamber of the Stars.	On to Something	This is remarkable work you've done! Especially for someone who hasn't taken my courses. These tablets provide new information on several subjects. They indicate that these obelisks are part of an enormous ancient mechanism that once kept this whole region masked from the rest of the world. They also depict how to recharge the mechanism, which is where your Shaft of the Stars comes in...Get ready, George. We have some history to make! 
Speak with Tammy Tinkspinner.	Desert Research	The dark blade of Sargeras has cast a shadow of destruction over this land. It seemed that the silithid hives were destroyed in the attack, but I have received reports that the silithid are returning. We need to find out how the silithid avoided destruction and what effect the blade is having on their hives. The crown wants the surviving silithid dissected and studied. Tammy Tinkspinner is conducting the research and is in need of a ""collector."" 
Find the Prophet Hadassi in Orsis.	The Prophet Hadassi	Prophet Hadassi is the wisest and eldest member of the Orsis tribe. He has not been accounted for and his well-being is of vital importance. Go into Orsis and find him. A great day of reckoning will come to the Al'Akir's lackeys if he's been hurt. 
Kill Blazerunner.	Blazerunner	I'm still a bit concerned about these fire elementals, George. One last request: head to the top of Fire Plume Ridge, and kill the one they call Blazerunner. He's the biggest and strongest of all the fire elementals in the crater. With him gone, I'll be able to sleep much better. 
Investigate the Sludge Beast's resting place and kill whatever comes out.	Sludge Beast!	Whatever is lurking around the Sludge Fen, it doesn't appear to be human. Judging from the remains around its tracks, it's also dangerous. You decide to follow the tracks down to the bottom of the lake and look for the creature's resting place. 
Use the Radiant Ley Crystal or your healing spells and abilities to resuscitate wounded dragons.	On the Brink	This many withered threaten to wipe our brood out completely! Quickly, George! Crack off a ley crystal and heal any wounded drakes you can find out on the battlefield. I will do what I can to keep these whelplings safe and healthy. 
Gather 6 samples of Corrupted Thistle Bear Guts and bring them to Buzzbox 723 for analysis.	Buzzbox 723	There are a couple other forms of wildlife that we've verified infected. It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now. Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information. 
Collect 10 Maddened Writings from Black Empire Cultists in Uldum.	Wisdom From Madness	In my visions I hear... voices...Their words are nonsense, but over time patterns arise. I believe there is something important behind what these voices say, but I have yet to decipher a word. We will need to learn from the source. Find any writings you can among the cultists who travel with these dark creatures. Their ramblings may be the key to understanding the message beneath this madness. 
Obtain a Young Twilight Drake's Skull at the Ascendant's Rise in Hyjal.	Brood of Evil	This egg you recovered is an alarming sign, George. The Twilight dragons are usually raised from stolen eggs from other dragonflights, which are then modified through dark magic. This ""natural"" egg is evidence that one of their matriarchs has become a viable broodmother. We must destroy her before her brood spreads. Go to the Ascendant's Rise where they claim these aberrations are kept and slay one of the juvenile drakes. We will use its skull to lure out its mother. 
	Corrupted Windblossom	 
Return to Larien at the Grove of the Ancients with the information you've obtained.	Soggoth and Kronn	The Master's Glaive was the site of an ancient battle, George. The titans sent twenty of their stone giants against Soggoth. Of those twenty giants, one survived. The tablets say that Kronn, the largest of the stone giants allowed himself to be entangled by Soggoth's tendrils -- just long enough to be lifted close enough to the creature's skull... within reach of his mighty sword. It's a good thing he's dead... we don't really have twenty stone giants lying around to stop him again. 
Release Princess Stillpine from her cage and then speak with Stillpine Ambassador Olorg at Blood Watch. You must kill High Chief Bristlelimb for the key that opens the cage.	Saving Princess Stillpine	Help me, George! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods! High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage. To force him to appear, you must slaughter the evil Bristlelimb furbolgs that inhabit the enclave, just two camps to the west of this camp. If you kill enough of them, he will surely come for vengeance! When he shows up, kill him and get the key! My father will richly reward you if you can save me! 
Disable the Shadow Cloak Generators until you unveil Aviana's Egg. Once the egg is unveiled, defend it until the Druids of the Talon can carry it to safety.	Egg Hunt	Skylord Omnuron wants us to find Aviana's Egg, and I can almost guarantee you it's cloaked by one of Sethria's shadow devices. Search around the camp for shadow cloak generators and shut those things down until you find the egg. Once you've unveiled it, I'll call out to the other druids. Defend that egg until we can carry it off to safety. Go get that egg, George! 
Kill Queen Silith and any 10 spiders in Webwinder Hollow.	The Queen and Her Court	<Darn grunts.>Hrmph. Things falling apart. Darn not happy. Now Darn's mate killed by spiders at Webwinder Hollow. Darn demands vengeance! Help Darn? Kill Queen Silith and her little spiderlings? For Darn? For Darn's mate! Webwinder Hollow is northwest of here, up the path. Go! 
Kill 7 Venture Co. Workers for Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village.	The Venture Co.	This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background. Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message. 
Speak with Cannoneer Smythe.	The Guns of Northwatch	Captain Fisher signaled us from below. The Horde fleet is landing shore parties? We can't let them flank us from the beach. I've already sent two of my best gunners down there to defend the beach head. Talk to Cannoneer Smythe down on the shore. You'll have to fight your way through the courtyard to get there. See if you can help the others secure the hold on your way down! 
Doctor Draxlegauge in Faldir's Cove wants you to collect 10 Elven Gems and return the Goggles of Gem Hunting once you are done.	Sunken Treasure	The treasure has been on the sea floor so long that the gems have calcified into thick stone. But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily. A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way! So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, George, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for Captain O'Breen. I'd swim down there myself but...um...well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land....er, yeah. 
Return the pamphlet to Xar'Ti at Sen'jin Village in southern Durotar.	Learn to Ride in Durotar	This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Xar'Ti. Xar'Ti can be found at Sen'jin Village in southern Durotar. 
	Chilled Meat	 
Report to Gremix at Mossy Pile.	Mossy Pile	Here in Marshal's Stand, I can't really do too much profiteering without arousing suspicion from the scientists. There is, however, another place where I might have use of you. My business associate, Gremix, has a camp northwest of here, on the opposite side of the volcano. He's a savvy business mind, and has a better eye for profit than even I do. I'm sure he could put you to work, if you'd like to make some more coin. 
Speak with Sentinel Velene Starstrike at Stardust Spire.	To the Spire	We've lost Silverwind Refuge! All that I know is that there was a surprise attack by the Horde and that they somehow turned Mystral Lake's elemental guardians against us. The survivors have fallen back to Stardust Spire. George, they need your help. Head south by southeast. You'll find the spire at the mouth of the Talondeep Pass, which leads into the Stonetalon Mountains. I'm sure that you'll find Sentinel Velene Starstrike helping with the counter-offensive there. 
Find the carcass of Lar'korwi's freshest kill and steal a Piece of Threshadon Carcass.	The Fare of Lar'korwi	Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind. Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot. If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it. Start your search to the west. 
Obtain 16 Satyr Horns.	Satyr Slaying!	I can't believe that Anilia is gone... We used to play together in the forests all the time. I almost feel... sad. I know something that might make me feel better. Please, slay the satyrs that took Anilia from me! Bring me their horns as proof of your actions and you will forever have my gratitude. 
Use the Reinforced Cage to capture 5 Cavorting Pygmies.	Unlimited Potential	Some see the little sand pygmy as nothing more than a pest, a vermin, or worse yet, a vile little demon. I say they are simply misunderstood! With the proper care and guidance, these little fellows may just turn out to be a glorious gift of nature. I would like you to take these cages and use them to capture a few of them for me to work with. You will need to give them a sound beating before boxing them up, but in the end it will be for their own good. You'll see! Go south for pygmies! 
Use The Refleshifier to de-stonify eight Mountainfoot Miners within the Mountainfoot Strip Mine.	Refleshification	<The nearby radio calls out to you.>Hey George, you got that gun? Good! Don't point it directly at your eye. Aim that baby at my stonified workers and the refracted light should reverse the petrification process. Or it will melt them. Whatever. Return my workers to a state of profitability! And if the refleshification process makes them crazy-go-nuts, they should be killed for insurance purposes. Horzak OUT! 
Ride an Emerald Drake and slay 40 Twilight's Hammer units and 5 Twilight Drakes.	Slash and Burn	Victory is possible, George. This portal is not just a means of bringing back Cenarius through the dream. Think about it, George. Once a gateway through the Emerald Dream is open, our forces can use them to move freely from Moonglade, Nordrassil, and even Wyrmrest, to this strategic location. All Ysera needs is time. It'll be up to you to keep the Twilight's Hammer forces in Darkwhisper Gorge from pulling together and attacking us from the east. Take one of the emerald drakes and hit them hard, George. 
Report to Thisalee at the entrance to Sethria's Roost in Mount Hyjal.	Fact-Finding Mission	The dragon Sethria must be stopped. We know that her roost is south of here, along the southern cliffs of Hyjal, but beyond that we know little else. I have sent Thisalee on a fact-finding mission to Sethria's Roost. She specifically requested your help - evidently you made quite an impression with the young druid. Meet Thisalee just beyond the tunnel leading to Sethria's Roost. And remember, this is a fact-finding mission - don't do anything crazy! 
Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Pyromancers and 10 Sunhawk Defenders.	Limits of Physical Exhaustion	Victory is close at hand, George. With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers. To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me. 
Mount a Grounded Wind Rider and fly over Talrendis Point. Destroy 6 Talrendis Glaive Throwers and bomb the Command Center.	Blacken the Skies	George! Give us a hand here, will ya? Gorsch here had a bad experience at the all-you-can-eat seafood joint back in town, and now we're short a pilot. My job was to take out those elven glaive throwers before they cut our air units to ribbons. Hop on this wind rider and take to the skies! One of my bombardier buddies will ride with you and bomb the targets at your command. And hey! Chuck a bomb straight at the night elven command center - the large building south of here, beside the bridge. Glorious! 
Bring the Partially Filled Vessel to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar.	Teldrassil: Passing Awareness	While there is more I could speak to you of the moonwells and of Teldrassil, I must send you along. Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him. Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west. Mind you stay on the road though, George. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late. 
Call in Airborne Priests at the bodies of 8 Wounded Soldiers on the Shattered Strand.	Halo Drops	We've got ""soldiers"" all over the beach trying to get out of their work by dying on us. Find the slackers and use this flaregun to call in a priest to take care of the situation. We can't have men thinking they can get off that easy. 
Obtain Kroshius' Infernal Core.	The Core of Kroshius	The most fearsome demon in Shatter Scar Vale is known as Kroshius. Though many have hunted him over the years, destruction has only made him stronger. Time after time, warlocks have come to this forest and reanimated Kroshius. He now lurks in the southeast, surrounded by demonic fire, awaiting any who come to try and claim his power. I will not have this corrupt cycle continue! Kill Kroshius, and bring his infernal core to me. 
Collect 6 Prime Rubble Chunks from Frostshard Rumblers.	Rubble Trouble	If you want to get a boulder in there, you can use my own patented Boulder-in-a-Box! Normally I'd just sell you one up front, but I'm fresh out of materials. Earth elementals have been popping up on the peak directly south of town. They're a good source of rubble. If you bring me back a good amount, I'll pay you for the restock, and I'll throw in a Boulder-in-a-Box absolutely free! 
Collect 4 Disturbed Earth Fragments from Disturbed Earth Elementals.	The Disturbed Earth	We are here to monitor the scars of the land, and watch for further signs of instability. While we haven't seen any yet, a cataclysmic aftershock could devastate the Barrens even further. To the northeast, near the chasm, earth elementals rampage out of control. To soothe the earth, these need to occasionally be destroyed, and their essence returned in a ritual. If you help us do this, Mechanic, I would be happy to reward you. 
Destroy 6 Sandstone Golems.	Ancient Obstacles	For years, this valley has been sealed behind impenetrable gates. Now that the cataclysm has torn them down, the secrets within are ours to discover. There are yet some obstacles in the way. From within the gates, the bygone creations of the titans have awoken. They wander aimlessly across the sand, attacking any who approach. Someone needs to destroy the golems patrolling the valley; are you up to it? 
Place 8 Territorial Fetishes on Spitescale flags.	Territorial Fetish	Dis is no casual counter-attack. We be fully intendin' ta slaughter every last naga here and do anything we can ta ensure that dey will have no desire ta return. I want ya ta place dese fetishes on any Spitescale banner ya be findin' inside their cave. It should prove a clear statement of what we think of their presence here. More dan dat, da magic in dese fetishes will be weakenin' any Spitescale dat approach, which should make dem second guess stayin' on our isle. 
Convince Demoralized Peons to work and collect 5 bundles of Freshly Cut Wood.	Management Material	Truun needs wood, huh? Normally I could provide, but not today. With constant elf attacks, gathering lumber is dangerous work. The peons I have left are reluctant to venture into the woods. You want wood? Then you go convince the peons to work. And keep them safe! I cannot afford to lose any more! 
Collect 7 Plainstrider Beaks.	Plainstrider Menace	Are you familiar with plainstriders? Useless animals. Can't fly. Gamey. Brain the size of my knuckle. Too dim to get out of the way of a moving cart. I've broken more axles thanks to their thick skulls... Sometimes I think the quilboar intentionally frighten flocks of them into the path of our caravans just prior to an ambush. Make me proud, Mechanic. Cut a swath through those filthy birds to keep the roads free, and bring me their beaks as proof. 
Krokk wants you to kill Dorinar, Arminon, Endolar, and 12 Ashenvale Scouts.	Wet Work	Listen carefully, Mechanic. There are three leaders in this region who are commanding the elves, keeping their focus directed on the lumber camp. Slaying them will certainly cause panic and disarray, hopefully enough for us to successfully complete our mission. While you're at it, bringing down their scouts can only aid our cause. 
Collect 10 Ancient Tablet Fragments.	Field Work	This unfortunate pygmy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. As you ponder his bad luck, you take notice of the symbols covering his shield - far too elaborate for pygmy scrawl. Confident that Doctor Jones will find such objects of interest, you set out to find more fragments like this one. 
Collect 5 Desert Coyote Pelts.	A Favor for the Furrier	The commander can be most generous to those who demonstrate their loyalty, and I know of something that you can do to curry favor with him. Before building up his... ehh... workforce, he dealt in the furs of animals. He is quite skilled in the art of leatherworking. The furrier can do wonders with even the most tattered pelts. The dried oasis to the east is said to be home to a rare breed of coyote. Their furs would make a very thoughtful gift. 
Sorrem wants you to find the Ancient Tablets. Speak to Narimar at Furien's Post to ride to where Furien was known to study.	Translation	It is true that Furien dedicated his last days to a special research project. What that was, he would not share with me. Fortunately, I was able to recover his journal, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher. Perhaps there is a clue to its translation in the region to the east where he spent his time. Take the journal, Mechanic, and speak with Narimar when you are ready to investigate this mystery. 
Report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale.	Warchief's Command: Ashenvale!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. Aid in driving the night elves from the forest, so that we may claim its resources for our people! To reach the Mor'shan Rampart, you must take the Gold Road north from Crossroads in the Northern Barrens. Destiny calls! 
Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff.	The Black Shield	Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before. In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work. Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted. It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have. 
Garren Darkwind at Karnum's Glade wants you to speak to Khan Leh'prah.	An Introduction Is In Order	I have heard of your exploits here in Desolace, George. We are in your debt. I'm afraid I must involve you in yet another crisis, one more pressing than the rest. The landscape is not all that has changed here of late. Old conflicts have made way for new, more dire ones. I should allow our guest to explain further....Khan Leh'prah is among the last of the Kolkar tribe that once possessed all of eastern Desolace. We found him near death on our borders. Listen to his words. 
Report to the regiment at Nahom in Uldum.	Nahom Must Hold	As soon as we make our move west in order to attack Neferset City, the enemy will strike us from the east, where we'll be weak. Nahom will be the first to fall, and if it does, Ramkahen will soon follow. A small detachment is there already. Get a briefing from them. I want you to make sure that they hold Nahom until I can send more troops there. 
Speak to Harrison Jones at the top of Maker's Ascent in Uldum.	See You on the Other Side!	Alright, George. We've bought ourselves a little breathing room, but there's no time to lose. Follow me! 
You are to collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various Satyrs in Sargeron, and place them on Elune's Brazier.	Blessings From Above	You feel a deep connection to the distant past having partaken of the ancient blessing granted by this relic. You determine to make as much as you can of this divine gift. 
Find the Ancient Summoning Ritual in Thunder Axe Fortress.	You'll Know It When You See It	With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region. He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking. This cannot wait for the Alliance's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat. 
Collect 15 Slabs of Venison from Weakened Mosshoof Stags.	Venison for the Troops	As we chew up the resources of this land for our war machines, we deprive the local animals of their homes. If they are to die anyway, we should not allow that meat to go to waste. Not when the maw of Orgrimmar gapes open, hungry. Kill the weakened mosshoof stags that remain in this area and collect their meat for our peons and grunts. 
Deliver the Kurken's Hide to Moordo at Stillpine Hold.	The Kurken's Hide	Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice. 
Slay 6 Deep Corruptors attacking Tortolla's Eggs in the Ashen Lake.	Children of Tortolla	My children. They lie below. In silt and sand. The others corrupt them. Darken them within their shells. Slay the others. Destroy the corruptors. Save them... 
Speak to Jarod Shadowsong at the Gates of Sothann in Hyjal.	Twilight Riot	I thank you for freeing me. Let us take advantage of the distraction you've created and get out of here. We must hurry before the cultists catch on. Meet me again when we've left this place. 
Stop the Amathet from taking the Halls of Origination.	A World Worth Saving	We could not stand against them. Their warriors... wreathed in the sun's flames...They want the forge... to end all...Go... I will... endure... 
Use the Alliance Weapon Crate to arm 12 Grimtotem.	Grimtotem Supremacy	Throughout all of Greatwood Vale you will find Grimtotem under attack by the Horde. Hellscream's armies show no mercy and no compassion, killing anything that stands in their way. But no more! Take the armaments you brought for us and find Grimtotem in battle with the Horde. Give them the weapons of the Alliance and watch as they destroy their Horde assailants! Go, there is much work to do, ally. 
Obtain 6 Cactus Apples.	Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise	It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials.<Galgar wipes his brow.>If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise! Nothing cools you off faster than a piece of that delicious treat. I'll tell you what, George. If you bring me six cactus apples, I'll make you a few portions of cactus apple surprise to take with you on your adventures. If you're interested, you can find cactus apples growing near the cactus plants around here. 
Kill Northwatch Recon patrols and collect 10 Theramore Merit Badges.	Meet the New Boss	Our defense of the Barrens hasn't gone well under Gar'dul's command, George. Garrosh has sent Warlord Bloodhilt here to take control of the situation. He's here in camp, and if you want to make a good impression, you'll demonstrate some initiative. Head east into the Fields of Blood and seek out Northwatch recon units. Bringing the new Warlord a stack of their merit badges will help you make a name for yourself! 
Speak with Deez Rocksnitch.	Seril's Boast	Brutes and amateurs. It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an ogre. I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control... but it's easier to one-up these fools. Tell Deez we've got one more order for him. I need a block of ice. 
Speak with Wynd Nightchaser at Starfall Village.	Starfall Village	You've been pretty busy around here. If you're still eager to do good deeds, or just get paid, I've got something you might be interested in. Starfall Village is just northwest of Everlook. The night elves there recently suffered a pretty nasty bug infestation, and they're asking for any help they can get. A few goblins from here already went there to start exterminating, but I'm sure there's room for more. Talk to Wynd Nightchaser, he'll fill you in. 
Attend the War Council in Stormwind Keep.	Tides of War	Champion! An urgent War Council is underway. Your presence is requested in Stormwind Keep. 
Witness the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Isles.	In the Blink of an Eye	<The entity speaks with the familiar voice of Archmage Khadgar.>Azeroth needs you, George! After scouring Ulduar and Karazhan for answers, we know the key to defeating the Legion: five ancient artifacts called the Pillars of Creation. To find them, Dalaran must be moved to the Broken Isles. As our leader Jaina is... absent, Kalecgos of the blue dragonflight has offered the Kirin Tor his aid. The Legion is assaulting our current position over Deadwind Pass. Hurry! 
Report to Tharek Blackstone in Kharanos.	Don't Forget About Us	You're leaving? Make sure you stock up before you head out. More importantly, please speak to Tharek Blackstone once you arrive in Kharanos. Tell him what has happened here in Coldridge, and that we could use some assistance. Hopefully he'll be able to arrange something for us. 
Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Stormwind Harbor.	The Nation of Kul Tiras	Kul Tiras is the greatest naval power on Azeroth, and a former member of the Alliance. But we've had little contact with them since Jaina's father, Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, was killed at Theramore. Many have said that Jaina believed so deeply in the promise of peace between the Alliance and Horde that she betrayed her own father on that day. Perhaps she feels it is time to put the past to rest. Loathe as I am to put Jaina at risk... Kul Tiras must rejoin the Alliance. Light be with you. 
Find some Special Chicken Feed and return to your befriended chicken. When you find it, /cheer at it before trying to give it the Special Chicken Feed.	CLUCK!	""Cluck... cluck... cluck... BACAW! Cluck... cluck... cluck.""The chicken looks up at you and then starts to scratch its claws into the ground. You think it is spelling out a word, but you are not sure what it is. Could it be... S-A-L-D-E-A-N? Before you can ask, the chicken turns away and goes about its business. 
Use the Bravo Company Siege Tank to kill 200 Blackrock soldiers.	AHHHHHHHHHHHH! AHHHHHHHHH!!!	I'm here to help you and Bravo Company end this mess. You're to get in the Bravo Company siege tank and clear a path to Keeshan's Post on the other side of the valley, north of here. This is a high alert situation soldier as the Blackrock orcs are now aware of your location and sending a large force to meet you head on. Terminate them all with extreme prejudice. I'll see you on the other side. May the Light have mercy on your soul. 
Find Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in the war room at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind City.	The King's Command	Greetings, Mechanic. I have been asked to assemble a team for a high priority mission. Please come to Stormwind Keep immediately for a briefing with King Varian Wrynn. I will be waiting in the King's war room. 
Ride the mercenary ship to battle.	Call of Duty	Citizen! As you may have heard, the Horde's attacking just offshore. The fighting's been fierce and relentless. We need every able body out there repelling the enemy! Report to the northernmost dock at once for transport to the battle. Oh, and our official warships are... err, a bit late in their scheduled return. Don't worry though, we've commissioned mercenary vessels to serve in the meantime. Hurry along now, Mechanic. Stormwind needs you! 
Speak with Kebok in Booty Bay to board a Bold Wind Rider. Then use the handbombs to kill 85 Brashtide Crewmen and destroy 6 Brashtide Attack Boats.	The Final Voyage of the Brashtide	We'll never survive this attack with all these worgen pirates pouring into the harbor from the north. Luckily, it looks like they're not armed with cannons, so if we can get you out of the harbor, you can attack from the skies. Kebok, the Horde flight master's assistant, is right around the corner. Talk to him and let him know that you're going to need his bravest wind rider. Bring a couple armloads of handbombs with you. You'll need all of them to stop those attack boats! 
Return the pamphlet to Perascamin at Thuron's Livery in Silvermoon City.	Learn to Ride in the Eversong Woods	This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Perascamin. Perascamin can be found at Thuron's Livery, southeast of the Shepherd's Gate leaving Silvermoon City. 
Report to High Overlord Saurfang at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Twilight Highlands!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to High Overlord Saurfang in Grommash Hold. High Overlord Saurfang requires your help to prepare for the glorious assault on the Twilight Highlands and our dual enemies, the Alliance and Twilight's Hammer. Meet with him in Grommash Hold at the center of Orgrimmar's Valley of Strength. Destiny calls! 
Obtain a Cow Head and an Oversized Pirate Hat, then bring them back to Fleet Master Seahorn.	Looks Like a Tauren Pirate to Me	Firallon wants MY head? Now that's interesting. But it's nothing we can't work around. This Yancey character probably doesn't know my face too well. Most non-tauren find us tauren indistinguishable from one another. In fact... most non-tauren find us indistinguishable from... a certain four-legged farm creature. Rikqiz the leatherworker keeps one of these creatures here in Booty Bay, and Narkk is my chief supplier for pirate hats. Get a replacement head and a hat, then return with both. 
Defend yourself and Earthcaller Yevaa from Iso'rath's bodily defenses.	Devoured	We knew this was a possibility, but we had no idea how the beast would defend itself. Iso'rath's body is reacting quickly to our threat. I can complete the summoning from here, but only if you can hold back Iso'rath's defenses. Keep them busy! We will survive this! 
Enter Nespirah's northwestern entrance, then find a way to communicate with it.	Nespirah	It is clear to me at this point what must be done, George. The naga can only be obtaining these pearls from one place: Nespirah, the ancient, shelled creature that rests outside of this cave. Why Nespirah would submit to the naga, however, is beyond my understanding. We can enter Nespirah's body cavity through a small tube near the exit to this cave. I must first fetch my master, then we can meet you on the inside. We will convene in Nespirah's northwestern entrance. 
Obtain the Dark Iron Memo from Gravius Grimesilt at Grimesilt Worksite.	A New Master... But Who?	You've arrived just in time. Here's the skinny: the Dark Iron dwarves in the gorge have been acting strangely, and the Thorium Brotherhood intends to find out why. Overseer Oilfist doesn't like surprises. We suspect that they're following orders from some new leader. I have reason to believe that Gravius Grimesilt, just south of here, knows who it is. Even here in Searing Gorge, we've begun to hear tales of your exploits, George. You should have no problem with Grimesilt. 
Kill 10 Brashtide Raiders in Booty Bay.	Turning the Brashtide	The Brashtide are everywhere! The Baron's Booty Bay Bruisers are no match for their sheer numbers, I'm afraid. While you're down here in the fray, why don't you help me get rid of a few of them? When you're done, don't bother coming back here. I'll probably be pretty busy. 
Bring the Weather-Beaten Coin to Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay.	An Old Sea Dog	This old, weathered coin was found on the body of the pirate ""Good-Boy"" Bruce. Its front side bears the image of a large, unfamiliar pirate ship; on its back side, the term ""Brashtide Crew"". Someone who has been in the piracy business for some time might know what this coin is, or what it means. 
Obtain Narkk's Handbombs from the Old Port Authority inside Booty Bay.	Prepare for Takeoff	I've got an idea, but it's going to involve some footwork on your part. As a goblin cartel, the Blackwater Raiders have a lot of explosives on hand. In fact, I know for a fact that our old friend Narkk keeps a case in the back of his shop, in the Old Port Authority. Go grab them and bring them here, if they haven't already exploded. 
Collect 8 Troll Juju and return them to Deathstalker Maltendis at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	Troll Juju	The corpses of trolls buried inside the Amani Catacombs have been rising from the dead! I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source. It's probably what is animating them! The catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, Mechanic! 
Kill 8 Bloodsail Corsairs in Booty Bay.	The Damsel's (Bad) Luck	I heard that this ship here is the Damsel's Luck. Didn't you used to be the captain of that thing? You must know your way around it, then. The Brashtide are our main concern, but we still don't want to take an unnecessary pummeling from those cannons of theirs. Grab this rope behind me and take out some of those angry-looking corsairs. Check in with the Baron when you're done. 
Slay Fleet Master Seahorn and Baron Revilgaz of Booty Bay, and then return to Fleet Master Firallon aboard the Crimson Veil off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.	Avast Ye, Admiral!	Listen close, sea dawg... the powers of Booty Bay is what keeps us Bloodsail from sailing wheres we like and taking whats we want as rights o' plunder. Were ye to put a knife to Fleet Master Seahorn, we'd ne'er run afoul of a Booty Bay's vessel. Were ye to put a knife to Baron Revilgaz, we'd ne'er face the law on their terms. If ye are to be an honorary admiral amongst us - yes, ADMIRAL, you'll puts a knife to both of 'em as I've says. Go now <lad/lass>, and return to me once ye does the deeds. 
Report to Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay.	Seeking Seahorn	When the Brashtide pulled in, Seahorn grabbed the nearest weapon he could find and jumped off the ledge here. You'll find him down below, probably pounding new holes into those worgen's skulls. Help him out down there. I can handle the motivation from up here. 
Buy a gryphon ride from the gryphon master Bartlett the Brave, then bring Argus' Note to Osric Strang, in the shop Limited Immunity, in the Old Town of Stormwind.	Continue to Stormwind	For a small fee, you can take a gryphon to Stormwind, so you can deliver Argus' note to Osric. You won't get there faster any other way. If that sounds acceptable, then just speak to me again when you're ready for the ride. I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it! 
Obtain Rasha'krak's Bracers of Binding.	Rasha'krak	Based on this information you've delivered, I believe that one of this ""Archduke's"" minions may already have turned its eyes toward Thorium Point. His name is Rasha'krak, and he patrols the lava pools just to our south. He looks like the latent fire elementals that rage nearby, except for one small difference: the bracers of binding that encircle his wrists. Find him and bring these bracers to me, George. I need proof that we are in danger before we involve ourselves in elemental wars. 
Free the Prisoners of War locked up in the prison at Render's Valley.	Prisoners of War	The Bravo Company field kit is ready, George. I'm gonna equip you with it and you're gonna enter Render's Valley, southeast of here, and free our P.O.W.s. I'm sending Jorgensen with you to watch your back. Now the prisoners are being held on the northeast side of the valley in a large cage, but the key to the cage is in a cave on the south side of the valley. You'll have to steal the key, create a distraction, and free the citizens. Good luck, George! I'll be in touch through the field kit. 
Break open six Icy Tombs to free the Frozen Mountaineers trapped inside at Helm's Bed Lake.	Entombed in Ice	Khurgorn tells me the cataclysm upset the balance of the elements all over the world. Helm's Bed Lake, to the south, used to be beautiful and tranquil, but it is now overrun with agitated water elementals. When they started to leave the confines of the lake, I sent my troops in to keep them busy, but most have been frozen in blocks of ice. If we can break them free, they have a good chance of recovering. I cannot spare the men for a second expedition out onto the lake. Would you be willing to try? 
Meet Khadgar at the Chamber of the Guardian in Dalaran.	City Under Siege	<Khadgar's voice erupts from the elemental once again.>Obtaining information on the Pillars of Creation before the Legion could stop us was a considerable victory. It won't bring back those we lost on the Broken Shore, but I believe it will help us avenge them. Dalaran has become a focal point of the Legion's assault. Your presence here is crucial. If the demons are putting this much effort into attacking the city, it means Dalaran will play a pivotal role in the struggle to save Azeroth. 
Deliver Belmont's Report to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest.	Belmont's Report	<Belmont hands you a sealed envelope.>Deliver this report to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. It is my assessment of the situation in Silverpine based upon your and Yorick's field work. If we do not stamp out the worgen insurgents, they will overrun us. The time to act is now! 
Warn the people of Stranglethorn and find the other Darkspear emissary.	Bwemba's Spirit	Dese be troublin' times for us Darkspear. Da Zandalar be reuniting all da troll clans an' plan to take back da lands dey lost. We tryin' to warn all dat we can. But it might be too late. Another Darkspear gone down to Stranglethorn to warn da people. But it ain't safe to travel alone in Stranglethorn. Help me find him and make sure da people in Stranglethorn are warned of da rise of da troll tribes. I gonna bind my spirit wit' ya. When ya get to Stranglethorn, I be able to aid ya. 
Speak with Lord Saltheril at Saltheril's Haven in Eversong Woods.	Saltheril's Haven	I swear that I'm going to fireball someone if I get one more request from Lord Saltheril concerning supplies for his party! Do I look like a party planner?! Between you and me, that fool and his sycophants are living in denial that we're under attack here! Some of us are actually busy with, oh, I don't know, defending what's left of Quel'Thalas! Mechanic, would you please head over to Saltheril's Haven and see if you can shut him up? It's just down the road to the west. 
First Mate Crazz wants you to check the cove north of Booty Bay.	The Bloodsail Buccaneers	You sure seem eager to work, matey. Not sure why some land-loving Human Mechanic is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away. We've made Booty Bay our happy home away from the high seas, but word has it that the Bloodsail have some new plan cooked up. All me boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies! What I need is a scout. Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find. 
Meet with Bipsi Frostflinger in New Tinkertown.	The Future of Gnomeregan	It's a victory for us every time we're able to help another survivor escape from the contaminated halls of Gnomeregan. Mechanics like you will play an important part in the future of Gnomeregan. To that end, our leader, High Tinker Mekkatorque has assembled a team of trainers to help you learn your arts. Bipsi Frostflinger will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She's waiting for you outside the tall building to the northeast. 
Anchorite Kairthos wants you to donate 1000 gold to aid in Anchorite Ayuri's efforts. You will be known as George of the Shattered Sun if you complete this quest.	A Magnanimous Benefactor	You've done so much for us, George. We greatly appreciate your assistance. You might have noticed Anchorite Ayuri's efforts outside. She has a big heart and is very convincing, but the donations do not quite add up to what she had expected. If you were to make a large contribution to her cause, I will make sure that word of your deeds in this war spreads far and wide. What do you say? 
Speak with Fargo Flintlocke at Stormwind Harbor.	Twilight Shores	The time has come, Mechanic. With Stormwind secure, we will take this fight to the enemy. To the Highlands! The bulk of our navy has already shipped out, thanks to your work earlier. But Fargo Flintlocke has prepared a seaplane that can make the journey in double-time. Speak with Flintlocke down at the harbor and tell him that you are to accompany him to the Highlands. He will be by the water's edge. Safe journeys, George. 
Obtain Kiyuubi's Spherule, Letherio's Spherule, and Finister's Spherule, then combine them into a Twilight Tripetricine.	Dark Ministry	I got one more assignment for ye. This one comes straight down from the Overseer himself. Seems he was pretty shook up once he heard about that ""Archduke"" ye discovered. He's asked for us to hunt down three Twilight ministers that work over in Firewatch Ridge, to the west. Kiyuubi, Letherio, and Finister are their names, and they each carry some sort o' special rock. Combine all three and bring 'em back here. Listen, when the Overseer gives orders, ye don't ask questions. Ye just do it. 
Report to Admiral Rogers on The Skyfire.	The Mission	Well, you heard the King. Admiral Taylor's last transmission came from somewhere in the southern seas. We will begin our search from the air! Locating the Prince - the White Pawn - is of critical priority. The Skyfire is fueled, supplied, and ready to depart. She and her crew idle in the sky just north of the harbor. Make your last preparations, then meet Admiral Rogers on the deck. We will depart without delay. 
	Traitor to the Bloodsail	 
Bear witness to the rise of the Brotherhood.	Rise of the Brotherhood	I had no idea that VanCleef had a daughter, George. If there was one thing that man was exceptionally skilled at, it was keeping secrets. How tragic. Poor thing witnessed a horrible act. Had I only known. What was that? Did you hear something? It seems as if the gnolls are pulling back... where are my guards? ON GUARD, George! 
Recover the Perenolde Tiara.	The Perenolde Tiara	The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the Perenolde ""nobles"" - the ruling family of Alterac before that kingdom fell to ruin. It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in Ironforge, and fitted with the finest of emeralds. When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an Ogre Mage, Grel'borg the Miser, found the tiara and now wanders the Ruins of Alterac searching for more treasures. We would have you acquire the tiara for us. 
Speak with Kebok in Booty Bay to get a wind rider, then kill Fleet Master Firallon.	Bloodsail's End	We've nearly won the day, largely thanks to you. One task remains, however... kill Fleet Master Firallon. It looks like most of Firallon's crew is already dead, but I know that old sea dog well enough to know that he's not done yet. No, he's cooped up tight in his cabin, ready to go down with his ship. Speak with Kebok again to get a wind rider. I'll try to hold off the cannonfire while you're on board. 
Report to Commander Thorak at Bladefist Bay in Durotar.	Warchief's Command: Vashj'ir!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Commander Thorak at Bladefist Bay in Durotar. Now, more than ever, your help is needed in battling our most hated enemy, the Alliance! To reach Bladefist Bay you must travel south through the main gates of Orgrimmar and enter Durotar. From there, follow the path east to the coast. Thorak will be standing at his post near the docks. Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls! 
Lure and subdue an Abyssal Seahorse.	The Abyssal Ride	If you are going to be making it anywhere in this kelp forest, we need to get you a reliable mount. I think I've come up with a better plan than the sea turtle, and it's not far. Tie off a lure at the rope just west of us, and then mount the seahorse that it will attract. Be warned, you may need to work hard to break the beast. 
	Some Good Will Come	So much violence, so much death. Brothers have died, a mother has died, and now a panther cub will die if there is no one to take care of it. Will you take a pause from the violence to help care for a panther cub? 
Use the Ettin Control Orb to control an Ettin and then use the Ettin Control Orb on your Subdued Canyon Ettin to lift the Huge Boulder off of Foreman Oslow at Lakeshire.	Saving Foreman Oslow	<Upon touching the orb you hear a faint click.><You remove the orb from the pedestal.><You now control the orb, therefore you now control the ettins. Maybe you can use an ettin to remove the huge boulder currently crushing Foreman Oslow over at Lakeshire. Find an ettin and use the orb on the ettin. Then head over to Lakeshire.> 
Bring Dargol's Skull to Coleman Farthing at the Agamand Mills.	The Haunted Mills	You sense a malign presence coming from within the skull of the beast. Coleman Farthing may be interested in seeing this. 
Visit Thalorien Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar.	Thalorien Dawnseeker	You are the one working with Myralion Sunblaze, arent you? I know of a way we can test the sword. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell. 
Speak with Recruiter Burns at Stormwind Harbor in Stormwind City.	Hero's Call: Vashj'ir!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Recruiter Burns in Stormwind Harbor. Recent attacks by the Horde on our trade ships must be met with swift and just force! Stormwind Harbor can be found in the northwest region of Stormwind City. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>! 
Attend the War Council in Stormwind Keep.	Battle for Azeroth: Tides of War	King Wrynn has called us together for an urgent war council. It seems that there was some trouble with the Horde while we were away. The king was impressed with the valor and bravery that you demonstrated during our mission to Exile's Reach. Now that you've arrived, the meeting will begin without delay. 
	An OOX of Your Own	 
Collect 50 Pilfered Cannonballs from Gurboggle's Ledge and from Gilblin Hoarders. Use the Cannonballs to create a Barrel of Gunpowder.	Oh, the Insanity!	So, I've been thinkin'...If someone's out-of-their-mind-guano-crazy, do they know it? Case in point, I coulda swore that I'd collected a barrel of gunpowder from the cannonballs around here, but it's nowhere ta be found. I distinctly remember lifting the cannonballs from them Gilblins just west of here. Maybe they're right... maybe I really have lost it. 
Listen to Martek the Exiled's version of the story.	The Day that Deathwing Came: What Really Happened	These two have no idea how to tell a story. Theldurin's story was too short, and Lucien's tale was a little too tall, if you catch my drift. Also, neither of their stories had action and fans admiring my awesomeness in them. Sit back, George. I'll tell you what really happened that day. 
Speak with Priestess Hu'rala, then help the Captured Lashtail Hatchling escape from Zul'Gurub.	Be Raptor	Mind Control, very powerful, yes. With luck, you can help Ohgan'aka escape from Zul'Gurub. Then, Ohgan'aka becomes George'aka again! Speak to Priestess, yes, and help George'aka escape. 
Mount a Hearthglen Mustang near the Northridge Lumber Mill, then use its Whinny ability to send 10 Northridge Spiders to the Hearthglen Recruits at the Northridge Lumber Mill. You can round up several spiders at once.	This Means WAR (Wild Arachnid Roundup)	The Highlord was generous enough to send some of his recruits to protect us here at the mill. With your horsemanship skills, and their martial prowess, we can do away with this spider problem easily. Hop back on that mustang and scare those spiders again, but this time, scare them all the way up here to the mill. These Hearthglen recruits can handle things from there. 
Get in the arena at the Crucible of Carnage and defeat Emberscar the Devourer!	The Crucible of Carnage: The Twilight Terror!	We've got someone you'll really love to hate this time around. I wasn't sure at first if I should let him into the pit, but a fight's a fight! And who am I to turn down some guaranteed cash?!This guy hails from the Twilight Citadel itself, and comes toting a toasty punch. Better move fast and watch your back! Just give me the word when you're ready for some action. 
Kill Mor'Ladim, then return his skull to Commander Althea Ebonlocke in Darkshire.	Mor'Ladim	From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout Duskwood, following a strange and meandering path through the cemetery. We buried him out past the house on the hill, you know where that is? There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck. 
Defeat Warden Stillwater.	Lawn of the Dead	IT'S STILLWATER! HE'S ALMOST HERE! It's going to take everything that we've got to beat him! Let's do this! 
Watch Oliver Harris and Jitters attempt to cure the Lurking Worgen.	Cry For The Moon	I'm hopeful, but let's remain professional. It's business as usual for this one. Into the guillotine he goes... and if the alchemy doesn't take, he won't be getting back out of it. Jitters and I will attend to this. Please, just stand back and watch from a safe distance. 
Speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind.	Hero's Call: Twilight Highlands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to the throne room in Stormwind Keep. King Wrynn requires a trustworthy and proven hero for a mission of the utmost importance. Stormwind Keep can be found in the eastern portion of Stormwind City. Anyone willing may report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth for briefing. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Rescue Hargoth Dimblaze, Earthmender Duarn, Stormcaller Jalara, and Stormcaller Mylra. Return to the safety of the other shaman if Iso'rath's defenses are eating away at you.	The Terrors of Iso'rath	We need you! You were stuck in some kind of nightmare. So are many of the other shaman. It doesn't matter... our plan is falling apart. Some of our shaman are channeling protective auras that should combat the digestive juices and keep you alive, but we need you to rescue the other shaman from the tentacles. We won't be able to defeat Iso'rath without them! Don't stay out in the stomach without the other shaman for too long or you'll be digested alive! 
Obtain Maury's Clubbed Foot, Fitztittle's Ratcheting Torque Wrench, and Ephram's Jeweled Mirror.	Kill-Collect	There's three phases to debt collecting: asking nicely, asking forcefully, and something I like to call ""Phase Three"". Unfortunately, collecting during Phase Three is something that this old dog can't do any more. That's why I employ so many cronies, stooges, mooks, goons, and noble adventurers like yourself! Juntz Fitztittle, Ephram Moonfall, and Maury Wilkins are hiding out on the eastern coast. You should have no problem visiting them all in one trip... and bringing back their valuables. 
Use Erunak's Scrying Orb to view the location of Deepmist Grotto.	Undersea Sanctuary	I believe I've located the author of your note, friend. It would seem that he is in desperate need of attention if he is to survive. I shall attune one of my scrying orbs, that you might see him for yourself. 
Speak with Kurdran Wildhammer at Highbank in Twilight Highlands.	The Way is Open	My fellow Shaman and I will stay here to keep the portal open. You should go upstairs and notify Kurdran that the work here is done. It'll please him to hear some good news for once. 
Bring the Giant Crate of Giant Food to Captain Smotts' lifeboat, then use it to summon and kill Negolash.	A Dish Best Served Huge	Take this food, and put it in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast. When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come running! And when he does, there will be a stouthearted Mechanic ready to knock his corpse back into the briny deep. 
Drink from the Well of Tranquility, the Well of Balance and the Well of Fury.	Neither Human Nor Beast	It is time, George. This... alchemy that has kept the beast inside you at bay will not last for long. The first cursed worgen were night elf druids like our new allies. They, however, abandoned the balance that the rest of their kind embraced and allowed the beast to take over their minds. It is only fitting that their brethren be the ones that deliver us from the Curse. Go, Mechanic. Drink from the waters of Tal'doren and make peace with yourself. 
Meet Khadgar in Dalaran at its new location above Deadwind Pass.	Calling of the Council	<The arcane anomaly addresses you in Khadgar's voice.>Though I am loathe to interrupt your fight against the Legion, I must request your help in a matter of... diplomacy. We face a grave threat, and we require the full might of Azeroth's people to overcome it. The Horde must become part of the Kirin Tor once again. Some will not agree with this position. Please join me outside the Violet Citadel in Dalaran. We have repositioned the city to defend the Eastern Kingdoms, above Karazhan. 
Weaken 7 Dark Iron Steamsmiths so Lunk can help them fall asleep.	Lunk's Adventure: Cranky Little Dwarfs	What you doing? Why you kill? You need to get things from dwarfs? Ah, Lunk understand. Lunk have a better way. Listen: you go fight dwarf, but do not kill! Just fight until dwarf get tired. Then Lunk will help dwarf fall asleep. Dwarfs probably just cranky because they don't get sleep. Come on! Trust Lunk. 
Hand out 3 Quests.	Welcome to the Machine	Come in here dear <boy/girl>, have a cigar. You're gonna go far and fly high as a ranking officer of the Forsaken. Yes, indeed, this is the good life and you are going to live it! I want you to take these orders and dispense them to the lowly scrubs that come along looking for work. Who you give what to is wholly at your discretion. When you're ready, mount up on my trusty skeletal steed - so they don't miss you - and start living the life! Which means just stand there and wait. 
Speak with the Bloodsail Oarsman outside the Crimson Veil, then use the cannon to kill 75 Venture Co. Oil Workers.	Drive-By Piracy	Now that you know how to handle our cannons, it's time to hit some real targets! The Venture Company has found gold to the north of here... a rare type they call ""Black Gold"". More like a Black Spot if you ask me. We're going to take that gold, but first, we need to get rid of those Venture Company goons. I've got an oarsman who will take you out there. Head off the ship down the gangplank and speak with him on the islet's northern shore. 
Use the Fuel Sampling Station in Tenebrous Cavern to create the perfect bio-fuel.	The Perfect Fuel	How much do you know about fuel, George? Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few. Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel. Use that table over there and try combining some samples! Bring the result to me when you're done. 
Slay Dar'Khan Drathir inside Deatholme and bring his head to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.	The Traitor's Destruction	Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours. The Scourge have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long. The time has come for payback, George. Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the Forsaken, vengeance will soon be ours. He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die. Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the Dead Scar. Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history! 
Close 4 Portals and slay 20 Demons in Deadwind Pass.	Finite Numbers	It seems not all the protections I put in place have been defeated. The Legion isn't able to open portals inside or near the tower... at least, not yet. They appear to be bringing reinforcements in through the catacombs running beneath Deadwind Pass. Disable them and you just might buy us the time we need to drive them out of Karazhan. 
Speak with King Anduin Wrynn.	Report to the King	We have slowed the Iron Horde down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde. The King needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future. It is probably best if you report to King Wrynn yourself, George. 
Gather 12 Motes of Myzrael from Drywhisker Kobolds.	The Princess Trapped	My name is Myzrael. I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands. These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world. Please help me. Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east. To power the cluster, you must gather motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it. I beg you, George, aid me! 
Enter the Crypt behind Light's Hope Chapel, read from the Argent Scroll, then complete his test.	Argent Call: The Trial of the Crypt	Behind our chapel, you will find a small crypt. Interred within are the bodies of our fallen heroes; those who gave their lives in the war against the Scourge. Their spirits are at peace, but they return intermittently to test new members of the order. The three of you may test together. Enter the crypt, then read from this scroll. Lord Raymond George - my predecessor - will preside over your test. 
Jump on a Hippogryph when Tobias signals you and destroy the Horde Gunship.	Endgame	We need to get rid of that flying gunship if our people have any chance of escaping. Here's the plan. Keel Harbor had its share of rebel sympathizers in the old days. I've managed to round up a hefty amount of incendiary explosives from one of our storehouses. We're going to hit the enemy with a force small enough to fly undetected. The night elf hippogryphs should do the trick. Tobias will give you the signal when we're ready to go. 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (1 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains extensive information on the indigenous creatures of Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Steal the Alliance Battle Plans and Become Heroes of the Horde.	Heroes of the Horde!	Now to find their battle plans and take out their leaders! Should we succeed there is an orc high warlord who served in the war in Silverpine that is now stationed at Tarren Mill - located in the heart of Hillsbrad. He will grant both of us commendations for this! We will be heroes of the Horde, George! Onward! Together we will defeat the Alliance filth! 
Bring Thaelis's Head to Sergeant Kan'ren at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.	WANTED: Thaelis the Hungerer	The city of Silvermoon hereby issues a reward for the head of Thaelis the Hungerer, notorious Wretched ringleader. He is wanted for repeated crimes against the general populace of Silvermoon City, including the murder of two city guards. Report to Sergeant Kan'ren to collect the reward. 
Place the Infused Crystal at the Eastern Runestone and protect it from the Scourge for 1 minute. Return the Infused Crystal to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods for a reward.	Powering our Defenses	Ancient runestones once powered a protective barrier across the Eversong border. Many were destroyed during Arthas' attack; others were stolen. Of the three that remain, only this one has retained its powers. The runestone to the east might be salvageable, though. Take this crystal and instill its energy on the Eastern Runestone. The process should take but a minute. Beware though, nearby Scourge will be drawn to it and will seek to destroy it. Do not let them! 
Use the Fuel Sampling Station in Darkbreak Cove to create the perfect bio-fuel.	Fuel-ology 101	How much do you know about fuel, George? Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few. Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel. Use that table over there and try combining some samples! Bring the result to me when you're done. 
""Save"" 15 Human Seedlings.	Do the Right Thing	You have come upon a horrific scene. Someone or something has buried all of the humans up to their necks in a manner consistent with planting. The ghouls, which are seemingly tending the field of human seedlings, periodically jump to the nearest human and devour its head! You can end this right here and now. Take this shovel and ""save"" the humans. Do the right thing. 
Bring Prospector Anvilward's Head to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.	The Dwarven Spy	Listen, George. This is a very delicate situation; even though we've identified the spy, we cannot kill him out in the open. We cannot try to capture him either as the risk of him escaping is too great. I want you to go find Prospector Anvilward at the North Sanctum and kill him. Do this in a quiet manner, we don't want word to spread that we allowed a spy into our city. Bring me his head as proof. Ironforge will learn not to meddle with the sin'dorei. 
Kill Dark Iron Excavators and Dark Iron Footmen within the Cauldron until Dig-Boss Dinwhisker appears. Then slay Dig-Boss Dinwhisker and obtain his Dark Ember.	Dig-Boss Dinwhisker	Grimesilt wasn't as high up on the chain as I thought. We'll have to take out his superior and find out what he knows. Dig-Boss Dinwhisker's his name, and he runs the Dark Iron digging operations within the Cauldron, just northwest of here. His excavators and footmen patrol the eastern side of the Cauldron, digging downward, day and night. He's not known to show his face out in the field very often, but if you slay enough of his men, he'll be forced to come out and deal with you. 
Report the worgen's presence to Executor Zygand at Brill in Tirisfal Glades.	Escaped From Gilneas	As far as you know, a worgen rogue roaming in Tirisfal is a new development. This is something that Executor Zygand would certainly be interested in. 
Collect Well Watcher Solanian's Scrying Orb, his Scroll of Scourge Magic, and his Journal. They are found on Sunstrider Isle by the pond, the fountain, and one of the Burning Crystals. Return them to the Well Watcher at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle when you've collected them all.	Solanian's Belongings	With all the chaos happening here at the Sunspire, I haven't had a chance to collect my belongings I've left outside at various places on the isle. I must maintain my vigil over the Sunwell here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead. I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal. Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky. Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well! 
Recover 6 Stolen Rams from the Tundrid Hills by using /whistle.	Rams on the Lam	The rams we raise and train here at Amberstill ranch have long been the mounts of choice for Dun Morogh's mountaineers. Aye, there're a few here, but not enough to guard my family and all the animals. A few brave Frostmane raiders have taken to stealing our rams under the cover of night, taking them south into the Tundrid Hills. Would you be willing to help return them? You'll need to get fairly close to them and give a sharp whistle to get their attention. Their training will take over from there. 
Listen to Theldurin's tale.	The Day that Deathwing Came	Deathwing made quite a mess when he passed through these parts. If it weren't for me, he'd probably still be here, layin' waste to all the good people of the Badlands. What, you don't believe me? Fine, let me tell you the whole story. 
Wait as Rhea retrieves the egg from the Hidden Clutch.	The Egg Lives On	 
Obtain Smotts' Chest from Gorlash in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	The Captain's Chest	I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor. I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation. Until...Those cursed sea giants ruined me! They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay. I will not rest until their corpses pepper the ocean floor! One of the giants, Gorlash, stole my captain's chest. I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here. Find him and get back my chest! Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude. 
Retrieve 8 slabs of Stag Meat.	Stagwiches	Ever had a stagwich? Me neither. Apparently they're delicious. Now I'm not one for eating, but I am a businessman. If my customers want stagwiches, who am I to argue? You're probably asking yourself, ""What does this have to do with me?"" I'll tell you what, Mechanic, I need stag meat! You get me stag meat from the hill stags of Hillsbrad and I will pay you. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn't it? Get going! Stags are most plentiful to the west. 
Collect 5 Vessels of Tainted Blood from Jintha'alor.	Dark Vessels	The Vilebranch trolls here were always worshippers of the foul god Hakkar, the loa of blood. He was a sick and twisted entity that nearly broke through to our world, but he was defeated long ago. The Vilebranch are still stirring their dark cauldrons, ones they filled with blood years before. They're either holding onto hope for a long-dead spirit, or they're up to something new and just as sinister. Get me those vessels, George. We need to examine them with the spiders and see just what's going on here! 
Find the person who might have made Old Whitebark's Pendant. They might provide some insight on the item.	Old Whitebark's Pendant	The pendant has the initials L.R. etched on to it. Perhaps these letters will lead to the pendant's maker. 
Retrieve Messner's Cage Key.	Breaking Out is Hard to Do	The key to this cage is stored in a pouch over at the worg den, just north of our location. The problem is that the pouch is resting safely atop a tree stump amidst a sea of bloodthirsty man-killing worgs. You've got one shot to get that key without waking up any of those sleeping worgs. Head to the worg den and find a way into the center. Tread carefully and watch out for the Blackrock worg captain. Get the key and return to me. If you got a pet, I'd recommend telling it to stay back! 
Obtain the Head of Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay.	Seeing Where Your Loyalties Lie	Thar be just one thing...Yancey hears things. A few o' me hearties were pretty deep in their cups when they told me about some Human Mechanic that came a-rollin' through the Southern Command lookin' for charts and orders. Even ran a couple o' good pirates through, <he/she> did. Like I said, they were up to their eyeballs in grog, but still... a buccaneer's gotta trust his ears. So I've just got one small task for ye, one sent down from Firallon hisself...Bring me the head of Fleet Master Seahorn. 
Take Sarah Ladimore's ring to Morgan Ladimore's grave.	A Daughter's Love	Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened.<There are tears in her eyes now, as she slides a ring from her right hand, and presses it into your hands.>And... thank you, George. 
Acquire a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve, Springpaw Appetizers and a Bundle of Fireworks, and return them to Lord Saltheril at Saltheril's Haven in Eversong Woods.	The Party Never Ends	I like to throw parties... just a little something to celebrate the magnificence that is Quel'Thalas! But, I'm in a bit of a bind. I need you to gather up more party supplies. From Vinemaster Suntouched at the Silvermoon City inn, bring me a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve. From Zalene Firstlight at Farstrider Retreat acquire more of those delicious Springpaw Appetizers. And you can pick up my delivery of fireworks from Halis Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village. Be quick about it! 
Report the events of the battle of Andorhal to Commander Ashlam Valorfist.	Alas, Andorhal	Head south, to Chillwind Camp. Tell Commander Ashlam Valorfist everything that happened here. Me? I'm going west, into Tirisfal. My battle's not over yet. I've got an appointment with that harpy that calls herself a Banshee Queen... and I'm finding out what she did to Koltira. 
Speak with Sirra Von'Indi in Darkshire.	The Weathered Grave	The weathered grave marker reads simply:MORGAN LADIMORE<Upon further examination, you notice that dirt over the grave has been recently disturbed, and that a good amount of the dirt seems to have been displaced...> 
Speak with Fleet Master Firallon aboard the Crimson Vale off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.	Avast Ye, Scallywag	George... yeah, I've heard of you. I've heard that you're no friend of Booty Bay - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers. Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty <men/women> just like you for a special mission. If you're interested, head on out to the Crimson Veil and speak with him below decks. She's anchored off the Wild Coast east of here, next to the Riptide and the Damsel's Luck. 
Hunt for the head of King Bangalash, the great white tiger.	Big Game Hunter	George, you are a hunter worthy of our company. From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated. You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bhag'thera, and the treacherous Tethis. But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash. That white tiger is the reason I am here... yet still, he taunts me from his roost to the south. Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none. 
Speak with High Overlord Saurfang.	Warning Orgrimmar	We have slowed the Iron Horde down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde. The Warchief needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future. It is probably best if you report to High Overlord Saurfang yourself, Mechanic. 
Use the Twilight Highlands Portal in Orgrimmar to return to Dragonmaw Port in the Twilight Highlands and speak to Zaela.	Return to the Highlands	With Orgrimmar secure and our Dragonmaw allies behind us, we can turn our attention to the conquest of the Twilight Highlands and the utter destruction of Deathwing's forces there. I need the Horde's best on the front lines. That means you. And all your friends. The Highlands WILL be ours! Use the new portal you created to return to Dragonmaw Port. Report to Zaela to see where she needs you the most. 
Lead squad from Highbank to the closed Dragonmaw Gate. If you lose your squad, return to Master Mathias Shaw for reassignment.	If The Key Fits	The wyrms have already taken the battle to the sky above Grim Batol. It's up to us to move our men in by ground and secure the gates. I want you to know what is at stake here, Mechanic. Grim Batol is the source of Twilight's Hammer reinforcements to all of the highlands. If we do not cut them off here, we will not win the battles ahead. I'm sending a squad from Highbank with you. Get to the gate to the southeast and get it open. Your lieutenant should have any further instructions you'll need from there. 
Collect 7 Stromgarde Badges from Syndicate enemies in Stromgarde Keep.	Stromgarde Badges	The Syndicate in Stromgarde do battle with our contingent of militia there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen. We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen! Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges. 
	Gaining Acceptance	 
Place the Gurubashi Incense in front of the Totem of Hir'eek, then listen to Zanzil's plot.	Backdoor Dealings	Zanzil the Outcast, an exile from the Gurubashi tribe, is my quarry. Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the emissary he sent to the Skullsplitters. This is not good news. I want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans. Take this incense, and place it in front of the bat totem in the Ruins of Jubuwal, to the east. Hir'eek will guide you from there. 
Explore the Jasperlode Mine, then report back to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.	The Jasperlode Mine	Thanks to you we know the Fargodeep Mine is infested with kobolds. Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant Jasperlode Mine. Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence. To reach the mine, travel east along the road until you reach the Tower of Azora. From the tower, head north and you'll find the mine in the foothills. 
Investigate Smuggler's Scar in the Kelp'thar forest, then signal to Adarrah that it's safe to enter.	Gimme Shelter!	Please, Human! You must help me! I've barely managed to survive, what with naga, sharks, and that horrible monster that attacked our ship. I can see a cave that might be safe, but I don't dare try to make it unless I know there's air inside. Can you make sure it's ok? 
Examine the Horde Plans at the Dark Portal without getting caught.	Watching Our Back	<Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane speaks in hushed tones.>I have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for. I've seen the Horde periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there. I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting. My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed... 
Speak to Naraat the Earthspeaker in Stormwind.	A Personal Summons	<An unfamiliar feeling wells up from deep within you, flooding your mind with thoughts and images.>Hear my words, George. Our world finds itself in the grip of a terrible crisis. I call upon you to lend your aid in this desperate hour. I am Naraat. Seek me out at once, and your calling shall be revealed. I await you at the Eastern Earthshrine in Stormwind City. 
Obtain 5 Mistvale Giblets from Elder Mistvale Gorillas.	Scaring Shaky	If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts! And there are a lot of people who owe me. Think you can help me collect? First, there's ""Shaky"" Phillipe down by the docks. He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due! But to get it, we'll have to scare him. Go out of town and hunt elder mistvale gorillas. Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky. Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst. 
Take Korok's Second Head to Forward Commander Onslaught at Forsaken Forward Command in the Ruins of Gilneas.	Korok the Colossus	The monstrosity has fallen, granting a brief reprieve to the Forsaken soldiers on the front lines. Take Korok's second head and return it to Forward Commander Onslaught at Forsaken Forward Command. 
Bring Lilian Voss to her father in the tower at Crusader's Run.	A Daughter's Embrace	The whisper continues:<""My name is Lilian Voss. Before I died, I was a member of the Scarlet Crusade. My father, High Priest Voss, raised me to be a weapon against the plagued. I studied stealth, sorcery, martial arts, anything to make myself stronger. I gave up my childhood for him.""><""Then, as fate would have it, I died and returned as... this. My father instantly forgot me and, when I returned, ordered me executed.""><""Come. We will speak with him now, in his tower to the northwest.""> 
Kill 20 Worgen Combatants.	Resistance is Futile	<The F.C.D. buzzes.>This is Commander Lorna Crowley of the Gilneas Liberation Front. If you are hearing this message then you know that the Alliance once again controls Gilneas. Lay down your weapons and surrender. Failure to comply will result in your death. Our forces have locked on to your position and will arrive shortly. Resistance is futile. 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (3 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains historical records for all the notable locations in Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Find the old barrel near the ruined chimney and search it for your next clue.	Captain Sanders' Hidden Treasure	The clue to the treasure reads: Good work, matey! Now ye need to head due east. East up the bluffs, east to the road. Look for the ol' chimney ruins near the side of the road. There you'll find an old barrel with your next clue. 
Use your Enthralled Val'kyr's Call to Arms ability to mobilize 5 Forsaken Troopers on Felstone Field. Then slay the Opengut Abomination inside Felstone's barn.	Combat Training	A val'kyr's only purpose is to serve, and this one serves you. I am now giving you full control over her abilities, George. Roaming around the farm's outskirts, you should find several of the Forsaken that you just created. I want you to use your val'kyr to gather at least five of them. Once you have done so, take your newly-formed band of soldiers, bring them into Felstone's barn, and kill the beast inside. Today, they will learn what it means to fight for the Dark Lady. 
Defeat Deathwing, the Aspect of Death.	The Worldbreaker	There's no time! Deathwing struck before we could form against him. If you do not stop him, the Earthen Ring will end this day! 
Fill one of Sambino's Air Balloons and find his Lost Air Valve.	Undersea Inflation	Fine! Fine. You argued me into it. You can help. I'm leaking air worse than a zeppelin stuffed with quilboar! My air valve must have come loose somewhere in the trench. I brought spare air balloons - make yourself useful and go fill one up, will ya? And find my valve! I'll need that too. I bet the crabs snatched it up... pinchy, greedy little things. 
Slay Chief Prospector Hondo. Use the Inconspicuous Box to disguise yourself along the way.	Some People Just Need Killing	The tunnel ahead, headin' west, will take you straight to Chief Prospector Hondo's office. He's the big cheese around here, and Tak'arili's heard tell that he's a darn fine miner. That's why he's gotta die. There's just one problem: the pathway is completely FILLED with those pesky Nethergarde flunkies. That's why you gotta disguise yourself. Hop inside this box here, and sneak down the pathway. Hopefully you won't draw too much suspicion on your way to da killin'. 
Witness the continuing story of the Battlemaiden by using her broken blade at the site of the Kvaldir General's death.	Visions of the Past: The Slaughter of Biel'aran Ridge	Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment. I will tend to these soldiers - you need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden. Please hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time. 
Deliver King Varian's letter to King Anduin.	The Fallen Lion	I haven't left the deck of this ship since we got back. The fleet must be made ready for war. Don't know where we will be needed, but when the call comes, we'll be ready. Truth be told... I welcome the distraction. The others are paying their respects to Varian, but I... I cannot bring myself to face that casket. To face his son. Varian gave me a letter he wrote to Anduin. Please, take it to him on my behalf. 
Kill Obsidia.	Last of Her Kind	Obsidia is one of the last mature dragons that can continue the black dragonflight bloodline. She must be killed. If you succeed in killing her, you should inform Lirastrasza immediately of your victory. She's been fighting a long time to see this done. Thank you for being our fang in these battles. You've proven a powerful ally. 
Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.	Journey To The Sunwell	Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, George. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword. The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there. 
Use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at the battle site at the southeast end of the ruins.	Visions of the Past: The Invasion of Vashj'ir	The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past. I've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade. Perhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance. 
Board Mathel's Flying Machine at the Gol'Bolar Quarry.	Get to the Airfield	According to the plans you captured, the Dark Irons are planning a large-scale attack on the Ironforge Airfield! The council has moved most of our forces down into Dun Morogh to deal with the instability brought by the cataclysm, leaving our defenses weakened at the airfield. We need a way to get you to the airfield quickly. Take the road back west toward Gol'Bolar Quarry and find Mathel Rustwrench. He should have a flying machine you can use. Go! 
Obtain the Fang of Bhag'thera.	Panther Mastery	You've almost proven yourself to be a master hunter of panthers. Yet there is one panther which has eluded your grasp. Songs are sung about a mighty panther by the name of Bhag'thera. You will see if you can use your skills to kill the great beast. Bringing the Fang of Bhag'thera to Erlgadin should be proof enough that you are a master panther hunter. 
Kill Princess, grab her collar, then bring it back to Ma Stonefield at the Stonefield Farm.	Princess Must Die!	The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess. The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies! It just so happens that she's here now! Princess must die! Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time! You'll find Princess smack dab in the middle of our watermelon patch. Get her! 
Weaken 7 Glassweb Spiders so Lunk can ride them.	Lunk's Adventure: Spider Rider	Lunk sees you like to kill things. Let Lunk teach you another way. Lunk always wanted to ride on spider's back. Looks like fun. Spiders move too fast, though. Always slip away. We work together. You fight spider until it gets weak and tired. Then Lunk jump on spider's back and ride around. Maybe Lunk even gather some venom for you! No have to kill! 
You must use The Pewter Pounder to destroy The Pewter Prophet.	Decisions, Decisions	This is no magic solution to my curse! It's just a hammer! I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid. There's NO WAY I'm gunna use this to break my shiney - not after all I've gone through to get it.<Budd pauses in thought for a moment.>But that means I'm stuck down here for eternity...I had just learned to sail, you know. Ohhh... I can't decide. Here, you take the hammer and I'll just set the shiney down and look the other way. 
Inspect the Upturned Giant Artifact, the Overdressed Woman Artifact, and the Broken Tablet Artifact.	Keep Your Hands Off The Goods!	We've uncovered some incredible artifacts at this site. It's hard to be convinced that it's all authentic, but there could be serious historical potential. Unfortunately, when the troggs overran the site, we lost access to three of our most notable finds to date. I'm concerned that the troggs might have stolen them or defiled them in our absence. If you go into the excavation, find the Upturned Giant, the Overdressed Woman, and the Broken Tablet, and make sure they're still intact. 
Find Gidwin Goldbraids in Eastern Plaguelands.	Gidwin Goldbraids	I love my boys, don't get me wrong. But I TOLD them that I needed FIVE MINUTES to water and brush the horses, and what did they do? They made a stupid bet with each other and ran off! I should have known better... this always happens. Gidwin's the short one. He headed north, along the river. If you're headed that direction, would you tell him to come back? We've got to get to Light's Hope Chapel, and I'm not against leaving without him. 
Slay 15 Desiccated Scourge within Andorhal.	Scourge First... Horde Later	Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal. My old counterpart, Koltira, leads the Forsaken forces. If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once. I know Koltira well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first. We will do the same. Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers. The Forsaken will have to wait to taste our wrath. 
Deeg in Booty Bay wants you to bring him 15 tiny heaps of Snuff.	Up to Snuff	Ah, the sea life. I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life. When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff. Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right? So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff. Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders. I bet a fearless Mechanic like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh? 
Get your reward from a chest in the statue at Janeiro's Point.	A Shiny Reward	There is a stash of loot located in the statue on Janeiro's Point just northwest of Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale. Head to the statue and claim your prize, Mechanic. 
Head to the top of Nespirah and slay Overseer Idra'kess.	Overseer Idra'kess	My men are flagging, George. We won't last much longer against these naga, I'm afraid. With the Idra'kess' weapons, and Nespirah's pearls, we should be ready to bust out of here. Follow the wall northeast, and look for a ramp to the upper chamber. I assume their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening. Hopefully both. If you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers. Hellscream's eyes are upon you! 
Take the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot at the head of the river in the Hinterlands, near Skulk Rock.	Find OOX-09/HL!	You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed! I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!"" 
Using your Blackrock Disguise, sneak into the Skull Warren and convince Dragon-Lord Neeralak to take your Crate of Sleeping Flamekin. Speak with Eitrigg if you need a new Blackrock Disguise.	A Delivery for Neeralak	The warlocks of the Blackrock Clan often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock. Their leader, Xi'lun, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the Big Three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak. And Neeralak's expertise is in dragons, not in necromancy. I've used the slumber sand on those flamekin you captured. Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock imps, and not flamekin. When they wake up, they won't be happy. 
Slay 8 Bloodwash Acolytes, 8 Bloodwash Zealots, 4 Bloodwash Gamblers, and 4 Bloodwash Idolaters.	Neptool's Revenge	No number of naga deaths will bring back the Rockpool tribe, but any amount of revenge will help the spirits of my people rest more easily. Many of the more powerful Bloodwash have set up a fortress in the caverns to the northwest. Slay them, in the name of the Rockpool. The remaining Bloodwash have erected gladiatorial pools and Azsh'ir altars on our beach, where they pit my people against one another and worship their false god. Slay them, in the name of the Tidehunter. 
Get in the arena at the Crucible of Carnage and defeat Hurp'derp!	The Crucible of Carnage: The Bloodeye Bruiser!	I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand or the bloodbowl in Zul'Drak, but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Twi-Hi, pal. You're new to this pit, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match. If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say? 
Find the corpse of Lord Vincent Godfrey.	A Man Named Godfrey	Lord Vincent Godfrey spent his life defending the kingdom of Gilneas. When the worgen curse ravaged this land, Godfrey was one of the first Gilneans to take up arms against the beasts. It is said that upon discovering that his king was afflicted by the curse, Godfrey took his own life. He would rather be dead than serve the very creatures that he had defended his home against. We are going to give him a second chance, George. Together we will battle southeast towards Tempest's Reach to collect his corpse. 
Use Gryphon Chow to feed 7 Trained Razorbeak gryphons.	Razorbeak Friends	Our clan reveres the gryphon as a sacred animal. They're majestic creatures of the skies, and more than just beasts; they're intelligent and cunning. Some say we keep them, but it's more of a friendship. If you want to befriend the Wildhammer here, first befriend our gryphons! Take this bag o' chow, it's nice and fresh. Our trained razorbeak gryphons wander the forests to the south of the aviary. Go on and feed a few of 'em for me, aye? 
Use the Orb of Suggestion to subdue a Famished Great Shark, then use it to destroy 12 Zin'jatar at The Clutch.	Wake of Destruction	Our time here draws to a close. I must somehow follow the trail of these naga captives if we are to discover their purposes in this region. But before I move on, I would see the destruction of this operation! Nevermind their numbers, I have a plan that has the potential to even the odds. Outside this cave, famished great sharks, displaced by these naga, seek food. In their weakened state, they will be susceptible to suggestion. Use this orb to subdue them, then direct them against our enemy. 
Speak to the various homeless people occupying the Jansen Stead to gather clues about the Furlbrow murders.	Murder Was The Case That They Gave Me	Here's the deal, kid, we've got a full-blown murder on our hands. Double homicide... Single horse... icide. Worse yet, we're in Westfall. I could throw a rock behind me and hit a dozen hobos with motive enough to want to wipe these people (and horse) out. Now I don't know who did this and I sure don't appreciate having to come to this dump to investigate the deaths of a couple of squatters, but I'll be damned if I don't find the perp. You want to help? Go talk to some bums. The hobo... knows. 
Take Yetimus' Twisted Horn.	Yetimus the Yeti Lord	For years the mountain yeti of this region have been allowed free reign. Our complacency in dealing with the yeti menace has resulted in an aberration! Yetimus, lord of all yetis, has grown to a size and strength that our guard simply cannot handle. We fear that should his appetite lead him near Tarren Mill he would devour us all. Gather a party of suitable adventurers and dispatch the beast. He roams the countryside to the west. Bring me one of his horns and I will reward you handsomely. 
Protect Shakes O'Breen during the attack.	Death From Below	This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack. Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead. I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas. The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back. Are you ready, George? 
Take the Head of Onyxia to Zardeth of the Black Claw in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb.	A Most Puzzling Circumstance	You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Zardeth of the Black Claw. 
Bring the appropriate amount of supplies from the Tailoring Table to Thelaron Direneedle at Chiselgrip.	A Perfect Costume	Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as a troll. The Smolderthorn trolls have always worked with the Blackrock orcs, so you'll fit right in. Do you know much about tailoring? If not, then consider this your first lesson. My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it. Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here. Thelaron will fix you right up. 
Gather 7 Flameflies.	SEVEN! YUP!	We have to take action. Winky and Gor'tesh were fighting, so I planned this friendship ceremony to help the two of them make up. Everything was going well, until...Well, you know the rest. I even bought drinks! Winky loves flameflies. He runs off to chase them most every night. I'm thinking maybe that's where he went. You'll find flameflies to the west and north, wherever you find lava. Bring me seven of them, and hurry! Gor'tesh might leave next! 
Slay Stitches in Darkshire.	The Embalmer's Revenge	You're not the first fool to be manipulated by Abercrombie! That doddering old man is known as The Embalmer to us. He's a vile necromancer and a blight upon this town. And now, sewn together and given life by the very materials you brought him, his horrible creation approaches! That hideous creature will be upon us in mere moments! If you have any heart, George, you'll help the Night Watch drive off the abomination and save our town! 
Return Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters to Captain Kelisendra at the defended camp just to the east of the Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods.	Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters	Interesting... what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra. You've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there? 
Achieve victory in the Battle for Gilneas City.	The Battle for Gilneas City	The time has come, George. We've rallied and armed every available Gilnean. It is time to meet the enemy head on. Time to settle the score with Sylvanas and her Forsaken dogs once and for all. Liam is heading the assault from this gate. King Greymane and my father are leading the assault on the other districts. You have a crucial role to play in this as well. Take this rapier. Use it to inspire our men and women in combat. Speak to Krennan Aranas to take part in the battle for Gilneas City. 
Read the plaque on the Shrine of Dath'Remar and then return to Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.	The Shrine of Dath'Remar	Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting. I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon. But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so. Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king. He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom. Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor. 
Obtain the Extended Annals of Darrowshire from Carlin Redpath, and obtain Davil's Libram and Redpath's Shield from the Marris Stead.	Heroes of Darrowshire	The heroes of Darrowshire held relics of their own, and inside of those relics lie more precious memories. First, speak with Carlin and obtain the Extended Annals of Darrowshire. Within the tome lies the narrative that will drive our excursion through time. Then, you will need to head west to the Marris Stead. The former owner of the Marris farmhouse collected relics from the battle of Darrowshire - for what reason, I am not certain. Gather these relics, and return to me. 
Kill 15 Ninjas on Jaguero Isle.	Our Mortal Enemies	Hey, new <guy/girl>, take a look at this.<The dwarf flips up his eyepatch to reveal a living, functional eyeball.>I don't wear this patch because of any lost eye. I wear it because this OTHER eye is so strong, the normal one was just weighin' it down. This eye's good for seein' all kinds of things, like those masked hooligans that follow us around. Fleet Master says that they've been spotted over on Jaguero Isle. Once you get there, fire this flare gun, and I'll help you spot 'em. 
Meet with the Illidari representative in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.	Illidari Allies	At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the Illidari inside the city. But they may have just saved all our lives. I gave the demon hunters leave to establish a temporary camp in the Mage Quarter. I'd like you to be my personal envoy to them. Thank the Illidari for their assistance and see how they can aid our cause. Just... keep your eyes open. They have harnessed a terrible power, and we must be ready should they be consumed by the darkness within. 
Speak with Arcanist Arman to be teleported to Andorhal, in the Western Plaguelands. Then report to Koltira Deathweaver within Andorhal.	The Battle for Andorhal	We just received a windrider from the plaguelands, bearing news. It doesn't sound good. The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge. It sounds like Sylvanas has made her move, and to make matters interesting, she's put Koltira Deathweaver, the death knight, in command. They specifically asked for a Horde Mechanic to participate in some specialized missions. If you accept the charge, speak to me again and I will prepare a portal. 
Find the Rusted Skystrider inside Ironwing Cavern.	Bird is the Word	I've actually nearly perfected my dream machine: The Skystrider! The world's first flying Mechanostrider! But, wellWhen I was putting the finishing touches on it in my secret cavern lab, my other creations became, er, jealous. Giving mechanical birds a personality to begin with was probably a bad idea, but that's already done. I need the Supermechanical Robo-Widget from the original Skystrider if I want to rebuild it! Please, journey into the cave and retrieve it for me! 
Explore the Fargodeep Mine, then return to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.	The Fargodeep Mine	The mine in Northshire isn't the only one with problems! I have reports that the Fargodeep Mine in Elwynn has also become a haven for Kobolds. Explore the mine and confirm these reports, then return to me. The mine is almost due south of Goldshire, between the Stonefield and Maclure homesteads. 
Find Nida's Necklace.	Nida's Necklace	My friend Nida lost her necklace, and we can't find it. We've been fishing all day right here, and we looked around here already. The only thing I can think of is that it fell into the lake. Our parents don't want us to swim in the lake... my mom says there's some mean things underwater, but you look like you aren't scared of mean things. Could you find it for her, please? 
	Dressing the Part	 
Use Baelog's Valhalla Shot and Baelog's Warcry.	Baelog, the Glass Cannon	Before I start droppin' arrows on those dragons, I'd better introduce myself. I'm Baelog, the muscle of this group. My sword bites like a crocolisk, and my arrows sing like banshees. I tend to wear down quickly, however, and can't take as much punishment as either of my two brothers. You give the word, and I'll send an aimed shot right through your target's heart. I can also cheer my brothers on, sending 'em into a battle-fueled frenzy. Why don't we go try fighting together? 
Kill any 15 naga in the Abyssal Breach.	Defending the Rift	The whispers of the elements are crowding my thoughts, George...The Throne of Tides is under siege! I cannot stand idly by while the naga threaten Neptulon's realm. We must find a way to join forces with him. Nazgrim will escort me to the depths where I can commune directly with Neptulon. I must ask you to take a more violent path. Keep the enemy forces distracted until I arrive safely at entrance to the Throne of Tides. May the spirits see us through, George. 
Accompany Lady Sylvanas Windrunner to the Battlefield and defeat the Alliance!	Cities in Dust	Our armies clash across the battlefield. Crowley and his forces are losing ground and they do not yet know the fate of Lorna Crowley. We will meet with Crowley and his compatriots at mid field and I will present them with terms of their surrender. They will either accept or we will kill them all and leave their cities in dust. As my most trusted soldier, you are to stand by my side during the exchange. Tell me when you are prepared to leave. 
Relay Captain Tharran's orders to Mountaineer Dunstan, Mountaineer Lewin, and Mountaineer Valgrum in the Grizzled Den.	Forced to Watch from Afar	The cataclysm drove the troggs to the surface in hordes, forcing the Frostmane trolls to flee for their lives. Unfortunately, they've decided to settle right on our doorstep and make trouble for us. I deployed Mountaineer Dunstan and his squad to the Grizzled Den just southwest of town to keep an eye on the wendigos that live there, but now I need to recall them to Kharanos. Find them and tell them to deploy those remote observation bots the gnomes provided, then return to Kharanos. 
Use the Clever Plant Disguise Kit to sneak up on the Mosshide Representative and use the Potent Murloc Pheromones on him.	Axis of Awful	Alright, now just shut yer gob and lemme talk, 'cause here's the plan. Those gnolls and murlocs are liable to be meetin' out there somewhere. So you take this clever plant disguise of mine, and you wear it and look like a plant. Then you sneak up on 'em, and you throw this scent pheromone you gathered on the mosshide standin' with the murlocs. Then the murlocs'll flip their spit, and the mosshides will think twice about trying to work with such crazy lil' buggers! 
Use Garyanne's Goat Puncher on 12 Billy Goats in Fuselight.	It's Goat Time, Baby	We have a little bit of a goat problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed. They'll eat anything, and they seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around. It's getting really annoying! You'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge. Use this device on them to give 'em a little ""nudge"". 
Kill 5 Wretched Thugs and 5 Wretched Hooligans and report to Ranger Degolien in Eversong Woods.	Situation at Sunsail Anchorage	Sunsail Anchorage has been overrun by Wretched scum. As soon as we manage to get reinforcements to the area we'll show those thugs who's boss, George. In the meantime you can help by showing them a bit of discipline. Go in there and show them we are not to be trifled with. You will find Sunsail Anchorage just to the west of Fairbreeze Village. 
Kill 8 Forest Lurkers.	Looking for Lurkers	I don't know about you, but I'm not much a fan of spiders, much less the kind that come bigger than me. Loch Modan's a gorgeous place, but I'd say it could do without those horrid things waltzing around. Tell you what, I've got some spare coin, and you look like a tough one. If you head out and off some of those things for me, I'll pay you for your time. 
Speak with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection	First Arcanist Thalyssra has received dark tidings regarding the Nightfallen rebellion and requires your assistance. Journey to Shal'Aran in Suramar and meet with her. 
Recover 60 Creeper Eggs.	Glorious Harvest	Directly southeast of Southpoint Gate you will find our spider domestication operations. Through the years we have grown a kinship with the spiders of Hillsbrad and have managed to domesticate and breed the adorable little critters. Spiders now serve us as regular household pets and beasts of battle! Such diverse creatures they are! I need you to head into the fields to the southeast and carefully harvest the eggs that we have incubating on the bears. Deliver the harvest to Sarus at the mine. 
Assist Captain Taylor in the defense of The Briny Cutter.	All or Nothing	This is it. This is where we make our stand. We must defend this ship to our last breath, and make these cretins think twice before approaching it again! May our blades strike fear in their hearts! 
Obtain 200 Dark Iron Bullets.	They Build a Better Bullet	Those gorge-digging dwarves do at least one thing right: they make very high-quality bullets. I've been unable to reproduce their results, so I've taken to stealing whatever bullets of theirs that I can find. Ye want my help? Get me a couple hundred bullets from those marksmen below. I'm sure they'll be happy to give ye their bullets one at a time, but you might find it faster just to look for the crates filled with them. 
Search the Addle Stead for the Lurking Worgen and use Harris's Ampule to tranquilize it.	A Curse We Cannot Lift	What we do here is not a cure. The transformation cannot be removed once inflicted. But the mind...The mind can be restored, through alchemy, if enough is left intact. This worgen you've encountered sounds like he's fighting to stay aware, George. We've got to find him again. If he's fled the Yorgen Stead, search the Addle Stead to the south; he may be lurking in one of the buildings. Inject him with this ampule to tranquilize him. You'll need to be quite close. 
Take Chambermaid Pillaclencher's Pillow to Evonice Sootsmoker in the Searing Gorge.	Look at the Size of It!	Well, well, well... Isn't this a surprise. The Chambermaid had a gigantic ornate pillow and now it's yours. Evonice Sootsmoker will definitely want to get her grubby little hands all over this item. Take it to her and see if she'll offer you any goodies for your trouble. 
Speak with Long John Copper on the Damsel's Luck, Enormous Shawn Stooker on the Crimson Veil, and Wailing Mary Smitts on the Riptide.	The Brashtide Crew	The charts mention a group called the Brashtide Crew. This name is new to you, though you've heard about a few other newcomers to the Buccaneers. Maybe it's time you paid them a visit and found out what they know. 
Deal with Zanzil the Outcast and High Priest Venoxis. If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with Chabal at Hardwrench Hideaway.	High Priest Venoxis	Venoxis was the second of the two priests that Zanzil planned to bring back from the dead. You have already succeeded in destroying the body of High Priestess Jeklik... Venoxis must be the next. 
Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods wants you to kill 5 Amani Berserkers and 5 Amani Axe Throwers.	Amani Encroachment	Ours are not the vast kingdoms of the humans and orcs. All we have left of our lands in Azeroth lies mostly before your eyes, George. Until we can reach Outland, we must defend what little land we have at any cost. Our uncivilized neighbors to the southeast, the Amani trolls, certainly have a different opinion regarding the ownership of these lands. Their daily raids are something we can't tolerate anymore. Go to their settlements, Zeb'Watha and Tor'Watha, and teach them a lesson. 
Retrieve Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb in Stromgarde Keep.	Trol'kalar	The last sigil is mine...and with it, the four combine to the Sigil of Trollbane, key to the tomb. We are ready. Trol'kalar lies sealed with its master's remains, within Trollbane's tomb in the catacombs of Stromgarde. It will be defended heavily...but my presence before you is proof enough that the defenders can be overcome. Enter the tomb, retrieve Trol'kalar, and bring it here. 
You must defeat Akasha to obtain the Horde Chest Key which you must then use to open the Sunken Horde Chest.	The Horde's Hoard	It is unclear what manner of creature scrawled the seemingly random markings on this piece of parchment, but upon close inspection, some of the obscure shapes begin to look like landmarks. Scanning the sea floor, you think you recognize a few points of reference, one being a nearby sunken ship. If your guess is correct, there appears to be treasure of some kind near the wreck. You cannot help but wonder what the scaly, serpentine figure on the map might represent.... 
Bring 8 Painted Gnoll Armbands to Deputy Rainer at the Barracks.	Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty	Gnolls, brutish creatures with no decent business in these lands, have been seen along the borders of Elwynn Forest. A large pack of them, many more than we can handle alone, have infested the woods south of the guard tower yonder. Another group has infested the areas near Stone Cairn Lake to the east. The Stormwind Army will commend whomever helps kill them. Bring me their painted gnoll armbands as proof of your deed. 
Find Baron Revilgaz's Barrel of Doublerum within Booty Bay.	Doublerum	<Baron Revilgaz sighs.> Even with all my suspicions about Firallon's plot, we aren't prepared for a full two-front attack between the Bloodsail and the Brashtide. It's going to take a small miracle to hold Booty Bay today. I've got a barrel of Doublerum in my chambers. Take the stairs down three flights, and check the first door on your right. You can ignore the warnings on the barrel... those should be the least of your worries. 
Capture 8 Hillsbrad Humans.	Human Infestation	This mine was once the heart of Alliance mining operations in Hillsbrad. It now serves as a breeding ground for our loyal spiders, though, the humans still occupy it - in a way.<Keyton grins.>But onto business! Warden Stillwater has called for more workers at the Sludge Fields. I want you to enter the mine with these shackles and capture Hillsbrad humans for labor in the fields. Break them out of their web paralysis and beat them into submission before you use the shackles. 
Use the Bravo Company Field Kit to plant a Seaforium Charge at the Blackrock Tower and Blackrock Munitions Hut.	To Win a War, You Gotta Become War	<The Bravo Company radio beeps.>Do you understand yet, George? Do you now see what we gotta do to win a war against these monsters? YOU GOTTA BECOME WAR! NO MERCY! With the P.O.W. s freed you're clear to plant the seaforium. Carefully make your way into each of the structures out there and plant a charge. Plant a seaforium charge at the Blackrock munitions hut and the Blackrock tower. Once you're done meet up with me and the rest of Bravo Company at Shalewind Canyon, east of Render's Valley. 
Hunt Tethis.	Raptor Mastery	Before returning to Nesingwary's Expedition, you will have to complete the impossible: hunt the raptor that no other hunter has been able to capture. That beast goes by the name of Tethis, and he's been known to terrorize the southeastern corner of Northern Stranglethorn. Bringing Tethis' talon back to that dwarf hunter should be proof that you are no ordinary Human. 
	Last Chance at Humanity	 
Hunt Sin'Dall and return with her paw.	Tiger Mastery	Legends speak of an elusive tigress... a feline so powerful that she dwarfs even the elder males. The hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition have hunted for her without success. Many of them have fallen prey to her raking claws, their bodies now decaying at the foot of her hill, north of Grom'gol. They call the beast Sin'Dall. You resolve to do what no Human has done before: hunt, kill, and claim the paw of Sin'Dall. 
Erunak in The Briny Cutter wants you to bring him 3 Saltwater Starfish and a Conch Shell from Seafarer's Tomb.	Sea Legs	Welcome to The Briny Cutter, Mechanic. I am Erunak, the last surviving passenger of this once-proud vessel. I'm afraid your travails have only just begun. The naga have been attacking here relentlessly. You're not equipped to be of much help down here yet, but I can remedy that. Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help to increase your chances of survival. 
Check out the food preparation area in Hardwrench Hideaway.	Bad Supplies	Some of da survivors mentioned food, George. We better check da food supplies. I gotta a bad feelin' about dis. 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (6 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains detailed assessments of the various threats present within Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Deal with ""The Hogger Situation"" and return to Marshal Dughan.	"WANTED: ""Hogger"""	Wanted: HoggerA huge gnoll, Hogger, is prowling the woods in southwestern Elwynn. He has overpowered all attempts at his capture. The Stormwind Army has placed a generous bounty on the Gnoll. To earn the reward, bounty hunters should venture into the woods and deal with the beast. 
Obtain 8 Plague Puffers, 8 Infectis Inchers, and 8 Infectis Scuttlers from the Infectis Scar.	Frederick's Fish Fancy	I love the sea. Yes, it was I, Frederick Calston, who introduced the sea life to that lake in the southwest. I had hoped to provide the Crusade with a source of fresh food from within the borders of the Plaguelands. However, some of the fish turned out to be predators, and they now terrorize the other animals. If we're not careful, they will kill them all! Swim down to the bottom of the scar and save some snails, crabs, and pufferfish before it's too late. 
Search the Ghostlands for Knucklerot and Luzran. Bring their heads to Deathstalker Rathiel in Tranquillien for a reward.	WANTED: Knucklerot and Luzran	A bounty is hereby declared for the abominations known as Knucklerot and Luzran. These dreadful creations of Dar'Khan are extremely dangerous and have been sighted patrolling near the Howling and Bleeding Ziggurats. Individuals seeking to claim the reward must present the abominations' heads to Deathstalker Rathiel as proof of the deed. 
Use the Teleporter in the back of Fuselight-by-the-Sea to port up the mountain, then report to Dolph Blastus at Fuselight in the Badlands.	To Fuselight Proper	This, Human, is paradise. I've always wanted to live in a nice quiet town by the sea so I can focus on my explosions without any distractions. Quiet's not for everybody, though... 'specially the adventuring hero-type, like yourself. We've installed a teleporter in the backside of town that'll take you up to the top of the cliffs. From there, you can take the quick ride west into Fuselight proper, within the Badlands. There should be more for you to do up there. Tell 'em that Flo sent you. 
	Arena Grandmaster	 
	Rut'theran Village	 
Report to Overseer Oilfist at Thorium Point in Searing Gorge.	Thorium Point: The Seat of the Brotherhood	Did... did you see that? This is the missing piece we've been looking for! We have to take this information back to someone at Thorium Point. The Dark Irons have been known to consort with the firelord in the past, but never before have they brought their kind this far out into Searing Gorge. Thorium Point is west and north of here. You will find it nestled in the cliffs that overlook Pyrox Flats. Take this information straight to Overseer Oilfist. 
Bring the Skull of Horgus and the Shattered Sword of Marduk to Chromie at Crown Guard Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.	Villains of Darrowshire	The Annals of Darrowshire tells of the villains of that battle. It tells how the ghoul lord Horgus the Ravager was destroyed by Alliance forces during the battle. He was slain among the foothills north of here, and his skull remains there. Marduk the Black was never defeated, but his fabled sword now rusts, ownerless. It can be found near the road to our southeast. Retrieve these items, George. I know not why, but I am certain their fate lies with you. 
Slay 13 Plaguebats along the path to Light's Shield Tower.	Rough Roads	The Argent Crusade built these towers to be points of light in the darkness of the Plaguelands. I walk the paths between these towers, protecting and maintaining them. The roads have been dangerous lately. Plagued wildlife runs rampant, and bats swoop down upon unsuspecting travelers. It would make the next leg of my journey much easier if you could clear some of this wildlife out of the way for me. 
Collect a bolt of Fine Dark Cloth.	Something Stolen	Everyone's going to want to dress their best for this, and finery is in short supply in the Highlands. I understand that those goblin wretches off the coast use the finest silk for repairing their zeppelin air envelopes. A waste! Find a zeppelin flying back and forth between Dragonmaw Port and the Krazzworks, and liberate some silk from the cargo hold in the lower decks. 
Bring Bernice's Necklace to ""Auntie"" Bernice Stonefield at the Stonefield Farm.	Goldtooth	I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace. Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me! Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run back to his den above the mine. Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear! 
Magister Idonis wants you to venture into Deatholme to slay Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter and Mirdoran the Fallen. Report back to him in the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands after you've completed this task.	Dar'Khan's Lieutenants	The odious traitor, Dar'Khan, has risen to great power among the ranks of the Scourge. His lieutenants command vast armies of undead against our dwindling numbers. Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter, Mirdoran the Fallen. Learn these names well for in the Ghostlands these Scourge leaders are second only to Dar'Khan himself. Slay them and their mindless armies will be thrown into disarray. 
Use the Anemone Chemical Extraction Device to gather 8 Anemone Chemical Samples from the red anemones along the walls of Glimmerdeep Gorge.	Art of Attraction	I have an idea. A brilliant idea! Those clown-looking fish have developed a symbiotic defensive relationship with the anemones. Having dismissed anemone disguise plausibilities, I've uncovered the chemical attractor that lures the fish. I have a gyrocoptic thermascrub extractor that I've brought down to take samples. Use it to extract the chemical attractor from several of the anemones, then bring the samples back to me for rapid synthesis and deployment. Go with haste! Brilliance is waiting! 
Speak with the Deathly Usher north of the Rise of the Defiler. Once atop the Rise, destroy Razelikh's body, then use the Stone Knife of Sealing to imprison his soul.	You Are Rakh'likh, Demon	Hero, listen well. First, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northeast. The usher will take us to the top of the rise. Once there, I need you to help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear that I am not strong enough to defeat him alone. Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to. The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison. If we succeed, speak with Wazzik. 
Use Moanah's Baitstick on a Speckled Sea Turtle and ride it back to her.	Better Late Than Dead	Greetings, friend. It is good to see that you survived your battle in one piece. While Erunak tries to scry a place of safety for us all, I shall assist you in securing a less strenuous means of transport. I have prepared this baitstick to use near a sea turtle. It is crude, but it should serve to bring one under your control. Once you've become comfortable with the animal, simply guide it back here to me. 
Obtain 6 Akiris Reeds from Naga Explorers.	Akiris by the Bundle	The naga explorers to our west carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds. Traders use them to make medicines and poultices, and craftsmen use them to line armor or even wrap cigars! In the evenings, when digging's done, father's been teaching me how to use them... but unfortunately, we ran out. Would you mind getting us some more? 
Collect the 5 Medallion Fragments from Gilblin Collectors and combine them to create Lady La-La's Medallion.	Lady La-La's Medallion	Dozens of crude gold links make up this heavy chain. Dangling from the center link is an opalescent fragment of what must have once been a large shell-shaped medallion. You wonder if the other fragments might be nearby, and if the medallion might be reassembled into its original state. 
Retrieve 6 of Captain Kelisendra's Cargo and return them to Captain Kelisendra at the defended camp just to the east of the Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods.	Grimscale Pirates!	Thank goodness for you, Mechanic! Those slimy Grimscale murlocs have pirated away my cargo! It's bad enough that the Wretched have stolen what little magical goods I had, but the murlocs took the rest! What has this land come to? Could you retrieve my cargo? I can't expect that you'd be able to get all of it back, but I'll be grateful for any of it at this point. It was the Grimscale murlocs in the huts, just to the west and south of the anchorage on the Golden Strand, I'm sure of it! 
Find Pamela's doll.	Pamela's Doll	My auntie Marlene told me to stay here in our house because my father had to go and fight. My father's the bravest man in the whole world! But I've been here for a long time, and he hasn't come for me. Sometimes bad people come and whisper to me and I want my dad to make them go away, but he's not here! And sometimes when it gets dark I want to play with my doll but I can't because I left it in town. Will you find my doll for me? 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (5 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains a detailed list of the artifacts excavated by Ironband's workers in southeastern Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Use the portal in Dragonmaw Port to go to Orgrimmar and report to High Overlord Saurfang.	Saurfang Will be Pleased	The portal is ready! It's not powerful enough to transport an army, but we can maintain the connection long enough to allow important individuals to pass back and forth. Saurfang will want to know about our progress here. Walk through the portal to Orgrimmar, then deliver the news him. 
Bring back 10 Spinal Dusts to Magistrix Aminel in Tranquillien.	Spinal Dust	The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine. I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead. Bring me some spinal dust and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample. You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the Dead Scar, west of here. 
Meet with Lindie Springstock at the city gate.	Welcome to Stormwind	Now that we are back in Stormwind, I need to deliver my mission report to King Wrynn. In the meantime, I've asked Lindie to accompany you around the city. There's a lot to see and do in Stormwind, so feel free to explore at your leisure. I'll send for you once I've delivered my report to the king. 
Seek out Lirastrasza at the Circle of Life in Twilight Highlands.	Enter the Dragon Queen	Hello, Human. I wish we could meet in more favorable circumstances. The world hangs by a thread, and all that the Titans have wrought may be in jeopardy. It saddens me greatly, but my judgment is final. Deathwing - the horrific creature that was once the Earth Warder and once my friend - must be destroyed. I have prepared a site atop the Highlands, to the west of the Vermillion Redoubt, where I can bring about his end. Seek out the Circle of Life and speak with Lirastrasza within. I will join you there. 
Use Morbent's Bane to weaken Morbent Fel and defeat him.	Morbent's Bane	<The pieces fit, and the holy artifact is restored, gleaming with sacred light. This should let you defeat Morbent Fel's dark magic.><Further down the tunnel, away from the direction you came from, a heinous cackle rings out. It's the clattering laugh of a lich. Morbent Fel is just ahead!> 
Bring a Kvaldir High-Shaman to the feet of Executioner Varathress. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Setting An Example	The High-Shaman are in the buildings nearby, chanting and taunting, but not daring to approach me. These Kvaldir find their courage and strength only in the mist. They are a pitiful nuisance beneath the waves. I came bearing a message. If your ladyship has the time, bring a high-shaman to my feet that I might deliver this message to him and his people. 
Survive and then slay Skullcrusher the Mountain.	Skullcrusher the Mountain	It was a trap! Cho'gall lured you in with the Hammer of Twilight so that his gronn could finish you off. Survive and slay Skullcrusher the Mountain! 
Board Fiona's Caravan when you are ready to move to the next tower.	The Trek Continues	I believe the horses are ready. Argus Highbeacon, the gentleman who works with the Argent Crusade, spoke with me earlier. I understand he will be coming with us... that's great! I'll make room for him. I know that you are busy, so there's no hurry. Whenever you're ready, hop into the caravan, and we will proceed to the next tower. 
Obtain 5 Bushels of Limes.	The Bane of Many A Pirate	Gum disease. It's a real problem, Human. I know you're new and all, and probably haven't ever needed your gums cut, but the rest of us pirates have to deal with a little thing called SCURVY. It's why we keep so many limes around here. Well... we used to keep limes around here. Someone made off with our last shipment, but they can't have gone far - maybe to the nearby islands? Bring them back, and maybe I'll see what I can do to get you promoted from swabbie. 
Guard Thomas wants you to travel north up the river and search for the two lost guards, Rolf and Malakai.	Find the Lost Guards	A few days ago we sent two Guards, Rolf and Malakai, to investigate along the river, and they have not yet returned. To complete my report, I must know what happened to those men. Travel north along the river and find the guards... or their remains. 
Raise 15 Forsaken by killing humans on Fenris Isle.	Rise, Forsaken	Fenris Isle stands defiantly at the heart of Lordamere Lake - a cruel memory of a time long since passed. Though no longer infested by gnoll vermin, a new threat has emerged. Human refugees, driven from their holdings in Hillsbrad, have fled to Fenris Isle in hopes of escaping defeat at our hands. A critical error on their part. You are to take Agatha with you to Fenris Isle and slaughter all humans. She will raise the fallen as Forsaken, bolstering our forces in the process. Do not fail me, George. 
Report to Baron Revilgaz at Booty Bay in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	Call of Booty	You feel like you've done just about enough damage, and you know the Bloodsail's battle plans. You've done everything that Baron Revilgaz has asked of you. It's time to hang up the pirate hat and return to Booty Bay. The battle looms near. 
Ragnar Thunderbrew in Kharanos wants 4 Tender Boar Ribs and a mug of Rhapsody Malt.	Beer Basted Boar Ribs	Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs! Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the Alliance front. Maybe you can help me out? If you bring me some boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample! The secret's in the Malt! 
Report to Watch Captain Parker at Tower Watch in Redridge Mountains.	Hero's Call: Redridge Mountains!	While the situation here is dire, other parts of the region are literally quaking from the great upheaval. I have here a report from Watch Captain Parker of Redridge Mountains, one of our territories east of Elwynn Forest. He is asking for a hero to come to their aid. We are spread so thin here that I don't know how we can afford to send anymore military. Would you check on Parker and see what he needs? You will find Watch Captain Parker atop the tower at Three Corners. 
Board Fiona's Caravan at the Thondroril River in Eastern Plaguelands.	Onward, to Light's Hope Chapel	Now that the boys are back, we can head out. You headed east? Please, join us! I insist! Yesterday, we were in the Menders' Stead, and I was telling Tarenar, ""We have two paladins and a shopkeeper, but you know what we really need? A Mechanic!""Don't look at me that way! I'm serious! Come on, hop in the cart. 
Find Lieutenant Walden in the northwestern end of the Merchant Square.	Lockdown!	What are you still doing here, citizen? Haven't you heard? The city's under complete lockdown. Go see Lieutenant Walden -- he'll give you further directions for evacuation. 
Retrieve the Ring of Mmmrrrggglll from the Grimscale chieftain's dead clutches. Return it to Hathvelion Sungaze in the Eversong Woods on the bluff overlooking the Tranquil Shore.	The Ring of Mmmrrrggglll	The Grimscale murlocs have not been scared off by your efforts. But, I think I know what will send them packing, as well as get me some personal retribution. They have a murloc chieftain that calls itself Mmmrrrggglll. It wanders the Golden Strand south of the river inlet. The beast once slew a compatriot of mine, and now wears his ring in open defiance and mockery. Slay Mmmrrrggglll, and bring back my friend's ring. Then we shall see these monsters cowed! 
Use your Arcane Torrent racial ability on a Mana Wyrm, then return to Arcanist Helion.	Thirst Unending	If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic. It is a thirst unending, George - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent. Failure is to become one of the Wretched... hopelessly addicted and insane. Seek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it. Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me. 
Kill the Tainted Black Bears, Tainted Nightstalkers, and Tainted Screechers in the Tainted Forest, and try to assemble their parts into a Demoniac Vessel.	Demoniac Vessel	We need a way to get Wormthorn's attention. Something to break him out of his trance. Something that's guaranteed to work. The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies. Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel. If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it. 
Ven'jashi, the troll prisoner at Tor'Watha, wants you to bring him Chieftain Zul'Marosh's Head. Chieftain Zul'Marosh can be found in Zeb'Watha, across Lake Elrendar.	Zul'Marosh	Come closer, mon. Don't be 'fraid, Ven'jashi not gonna hurt you. Us Darkspears be mortal enemies of the Amani just like you. Their boss Zul'Marosh is evil troll. He give me the bad poison and leave me in this cage to die. I not scared of dyin', mon. I seen death in the eye an' I laugh at her. I cannot die in peace yet, mon. Not 'til Zul'Marosh be dead too. You find him 'cross the lake in Zeb'Watha. I hold this poison off 'til you bring me his big ugly head, mon. Only then I die peacefully. 
	Fiona's Lucky Charm	 
Survive 2 Massive Waves of Zombies.	Someone Setup the Pumpkin Bomb	You ever seen one of these?<Brazie pulls out a pumpkin.>This ain't no ordinary pumpkin, friend. See, once you plant it they'll lay in wait until a zombie shows up and then KABLOOEY! Zombie guts all over the place. Let's go! 
Find the Ambermill Dimensional Portal.	Transdimensional Warfare: Chapter I	<Sylvanas hands you the signet ring.>Take the ring and make your way to Beren's Peril, southeast of here, located in a cave in the hills. Once there, search the cave for the portal to the pocket dimension that conceals the Ambermill magi. I will communicate with you through your thoughts, George. Once you have reached the portal I will give you your marching orders. 
Speak to Fiasco Sizzlegrin just outside of the building to join the assault, then use your improvised explosives to kill 100 Azsh'ir Soldiers, 20 Azsh'ir Wave Screamers, and 12 Azsh'ir Archaens.	Swift Action	We have everything we need to begin the attack. If your claims were correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the run. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga. Kill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the southern terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old-fashioned way. 
Using the Firefighting Equipment, extinguish 6 fires at the Ironforge Airfield.	Extinguish the Fires	The Dark Iron attack took us by surprise. Their saboteurs managed to damage most of our aircraft, steam tanks, and supplies. We were only able to get a few of our bombers airborne. Every technician, recruit, and guard I can spare is scrambling to get the others repaired and flight-ready. Our infantry can only hold out for so long. Take this equipment and help extinguish the burning bombers. 
Purchase a Crate of Grade-E Meat from Kelsey Yance and a Crate of Pupellyverbos Port from Whiskey Slim.	A Giant's Feast	The next giant on my list is called Negolash. I remember vividly how he leapt from the seafoam and plucked poor Poop-Deck Paul from the crow's nest. Swallowed him in one gulp, he did. And snapped my mizzenmast in two on the way down. No man on my crew deserves such a heinous death. So we're going to use Negolash's appetite against him. Kelsey Yance should be able to sell you some meat, and Whiskey Slim has enough booze to knock out... well, a sea giant. You'll find both of them in town. 
Bring the Opened Mosh'Ogg Bounty to Dask ""The Flask"" Gobfizzle at the Explorers' League Digsite in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	"Dask ""The Flask"" Gobfizzle"	Hey - you must be that <fella'/lass> that Wulfred was talkin' about! The one who found the ogre artifact, and helped him test out those strange stones from up north. Welcome to the digsite, George! We were actually working on identifying those samples right as you got here. Would you mind bringing the sample over to Dask? I need him to help me find out how old it is. 
Acquire the Demon Chain.	The Demon Chain	Narkrall revealed to me the secret of his influence over the drakes in this area. I thought the Demon Chain was a myth, but he's had it all along. And now the fool is about to lose it! His life is meaningless to me but the Dragonmaw can't afford to lose that artifact. Follow him north, up to Thundermar. The city will be in chaos, so you may be able to land undetected. Return to me with the Demon Chain, even if you have to remove it from Narkrall's corpse. Find that artifact, George! 
Use the Forsaken Catapults to board the Forsaken ships and slay Captain Morris and Captain Anson.	Two By Sea	The Forsaken catapults are kicking the snot out of us, George. And even if we do take care of them, they've two ships with rows of cannons at the ready. I've a plan to kill two birds with one stone. You're the stone in this plan. Take out the machinists manning the catapults. After this, use the catapults to launch yourself aboard the Forsaken ships. If your aim isn't terrible, you should be able to land safely. Once onboard, go below decks and take care of each ship's captain. Good luck, Mechanic. 
Obtain Gregor's Remains, Nissa's Remains, Thurman's Remains, and Devlin's Remains.	Deaths in the Family	The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades. I used to work their mills...before the plague. When the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend. We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools. The Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath. And now they are minions of the Scourge! Serve the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the plague. Serve me by bringing me their remains. 
Collect 8 pieces of Incendicite Ore.	Incendicite Ore	Thelgen Rock over yonder is something of a natural wonder. It's the only known source of incendicite in the world! The stuff's rare, highly sought, and ridiculously explosive. Hit it with a steel mining pick and you'll set off a fireworks show that'll put a room full of goblins to shame. Luckily, I've developed a spark-proof pick for such tasks. I'll loan it to you if you bring me back some incendicite ore, and I'll split you in on the profits, of course. 
Obtain the Brain of the Unfathomable.	... It Will Come	I now imbue you with the energies of the corrupting faceless. Swim down to my luring totem in the trench to the northeast. Release the energies through it. Bring back the brain of their leader. Call forth to Ick'thys the Unfathomable... it will come! 
Kill Overlord Barbarius and recover the Blackrock Lever Key. Use the Blackrock Lever Key to free Danforth.	And Last But Not Least... Danforth	Danforth's being tortured on the other side of the cave. There's no telling what state he's in by now! We need to get over there and save him! Overlord Barbarius has the key to the lever holding Danforth up. We work together as a team and we can kill that bastard, Barbarius. Once Barbarius is dead, we use his key to get Danforth down and get out of here! Ready? 
Speak with Lil' Crazy Jerry to board the ship, then retrieve all three of Crazy Larry's important goods.	In With a Bang	Our trade frigate's still all the way out there on the water, swarming with Gilblins! AHH! Sorry about that. But really! We need a way to get you out there and get back our stuff. There's quality goods left on that ship! QUALITY! LIKE MY MIDDLE NAME! Lucky for you, I have an idea! Head right outside the camp and check along the north wall... my son Jerry'll get you over there with our cannon! If he's been practicing, that is! 
Search Forlorn Rowe for signs of Morbent Fel.	The Fate of Morbent Fel	Before I was lost to the woods, the last thing I remember is Morbent Fel. He was a vile necromancer, and the reason this land swarms with so many vile undead. I asked an adventurer to help me put an end to him. I thought they did! But Sister Elsington tells me the land still crawls with ghouls and spectres ripped from the grave. Morbent Fel should have breathed his last in the house on Forlorn Rowe, north of Raven Hill Cemetery. Go there and see what's become of him... 
Kill War Reavers in the Ruins of Thaurissan, then loot 3 Obsidian Pistons, 3 Flux Exhaust Sieves, 3 Thorium Gearshafts, and 1 Stone Power Core from the War Reaver Parts that they drop.	Scrapped Golems	We keep golems here, as guards. The dwarves to our north also keep golems, but I'm not sure why. Mainly just for killin', I suppose. We could use some spare parts for our own golems, so here's what yer gonna do: kill theirs, then look for any parts that might've fallen on the ground. Salvage what ye can. Ye probably won't be able to salvage everything, so choose carefully. 
Collect 6 Intact Swampshore Tails from Swampshore Makrura.	Maliciously Delicious	You know, I've got a problem you might be able to help me out with, here. See, in addition to the fine pursuit of arms dealing, I'm trying to liven up the entertainment here in Bogpaddle. Apparently there's a bunch of these makrura things in the north waters that don't take kindly to the wild beach parties we've been throwing. Joke's on them. I'm not gonna be pushed around by giant lobsters; they're my next source of revenue! You bring me some of their tails and we'll turn a problem into profit. 
Seek out Clerk Daltry in the Darkshire Town Hall.	The Legend of Stalvan	I'm here because I received a letter from my brother Stalvan, who I haven't seen in years. On arriving here, I was told he was dead...The entire town refuses to offer any further explanation. Any mention of his name is met with terror and suspicion. As if I didn't have enough of that myself! I'm afraid of what will happen if my frustration and anger grows any further. I beg you, help me get to the bottom of this. Implore Clerk Daltry for any information he may have on my brother. 
Complete the Warden's Game by teleporting the Warden's Pawns into inward-facing positions.	The Warden's Game	You see the statue split into two, then four, then eight identical statues in a square formation. You hear a voice, not through your ears, but in the back of your mind: ""A true warden does not face OUTWARD, searching for signs of danger. A true warden keeps his gaze INWARD, always focused on protecting his quarry.""Perhaps this is a riddle of some sort? 
Stand by for Warchief Garrosh Hellscream's arrival.	The Warchief Cometh	You're just in time, Georgenub. It is Georgenub, right?<Grand Executor Mortuus looks at a sheet of paper.>Yes, that's what the paperwork says: ""Georgenub.""<Grand Executor Mortuus points to your name on the sheet of paper.>Where was I? Oh yes, you're just in time! The Warchief should be arriving at any moment to meet with our leader and savior, the Dark Lady herself. Just stand by and be at your best behavior. I expect that when this demonstration is over we will all receive commendations! 
Kill 8 Arcane Wraiths and 2 Tainted Arcane Wraiths, as well as Felendren the Banished; they are located in the Falthrien Academy. Bring Felendren's Head to Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle.	Felendren the Banished	A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest. Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders. He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions. He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the Wretched - and he is a threat to the Sunspire. Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions. 
Use the Concentrated Solvent on 6 Ore Heaps in the Nethergarde Mines.	It's All Mine	All over this cavern you'll find unguarded piles of ore, just waiting to be tampered with. Our first choice would be to steal the ore, obviously, but that requires mine carts, protection, and labor... three things we just don't have. So instead, we're just going to ruin this little mining party with a little bit of highly corrosive solvent. Take this bottle - CAREFULLY - and pour it onto those heaps of ore. 'Cause if we can't have this ore, then neither can they. 
Slay Debilitated Apexar, Debilitated Aetheron, and Debilitated Edemantus.	Portal Overload	I used to be the caretaker of the Earthen Ring's portals here. But while we were away helping to save Deepholm, the Twilight's Hammer moved in and corrupted the area. They're using powerful ascendants to guard our portals. That's where they've made a critical error. I want you to go to the portals and use the controllers to overload them. This will unleash all of the portal's energy, debilitating the ascendant. Slay it. 
Kill Citizen Wilkes and Clerk Horrace Whitesteed.	Discretion is Key	We must destroy all of the evidence, George! Did I say evidence? I meant crazed undead! Anyway, discretion is key. We must not let the rampaging undead make it out of the Sludge Fields and no one outside of this institution must know about what happened here! Directly southeast of here in what used to be the old mushroom farm you'll find a reanimated fiend known as Citizen Wilkes and his cohort, Clerk Horrace Whitesteed. They have been causing huge problems for my guards. Find them and kill them! 
Report to Captain Alpert at Moonbrook in Westfall.	To Moonbrook!	We have had a camp near Moonbrook for quite some time now, George. One of my best soldiers works the area along with a company of Sentinel Hill troopers. Report to Captain Alpert now and find out if he has any news about the happenings in Moonbrook. Another ally of mine is also at the Moonbrook camp. His name is Thoralius. I met Thoralius in Northrend during my time in Valgarde. He is a wise and powerful shaman. Perhaps his abilities could help us solve this mystery. 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (2 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and seems to detail potential dig sites in Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Bring the Tainted Arcane Sliver to Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.	Tainted Arcane Sliver	You've found an odd sliver of crystallized mana on the corpse of the tainted arcane wraith. The sliver is different than others you may have seen in that it is as dark and sinister-looking as the wraith you looted it from. Just holding it gives you a sense of unnatural foreboding. Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle just might be someone who would have a use for the sliver. 
Seek out Witch Doctor Unbagwa and have him summon Mokk the Savage. Bring the Heart of Mokk to Fin Fizracket.	Stranglethorn Fever	Sick...so...very s-s-sick... have contracted Stranglethorn Fever.......technically... CAPE of Stranglethorn Fever.......deadly v-v-virus.......only cure... is... is... to eat the heart of M-m-m-m-mokk the Savage... elusive white beast.......Witch Doctor Unbagwa... only one who can s-s-summon.......seek Unbagwa in hidden cave on southern cape.......hurry... dying... dying.... 
Drink Krennan's Potion of Stealth in Tempest's Reach and assassinate Baron Ashbury and Lord Walden.	Betrayal at Tempest's Reach	King Greymane has been taken prisoner by Lord Godfrey in Tempest's Reach! He managed to convince two of the eastern lords to go with his plan. The fool seems to think he can strike a deal with the Forsaken by turning Greymane over to them. Listen carefully, George. We need to resolve this with as little bloodshed as possible. This potion will allow you to sneak in undetected. We need you to assassinate the traitorous lords before this gets out of hand! 
Kill Zephyrus.	The Durnholde Challenge: Zephyrus	Durnholde Keep has always been a place of strife. For years the humans used it as an internment camp and prison for the orcs. After that it was taken over by the Syndicate. Now? The Dark Lady captured and placed powerful elementals within its walls. She charged me with administering ""The Durnholde Challenge."" Any that can defeat all of the elementals will earn a grand prize! Take this guide and face your first challenge: Zephyrus! Durnholde is located just northeast of us. 
Collect 8 Skittering Spiderlings in Jintha'Alor.	All That Skitters	There's somethin' I've noticed up there... Jintha'Alor's full of spiders. Small ones about as big as yer hand. Not an unusual sight for the Hinterlands, but somethin's amiss. To be honest, I don't trust the trolls to keep pets. They're up to somethin'. I need you to bring me some of those spiders. Keep 'em alive if you can, and we'll see what the spirits tell me... 
Kill 5 Doomguard Destroyers, 5 Dreadlord Defilers, 5 Corrupted Darkwood Treants, and 3 Felspore Bog Lords in the Tainted Forest.	The Demons and the Druid	The Reliquary is focused on the acquisition and preservation of magical artifacts. Our particular excursion is focused on the demonic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the Tainted Scar. A worgen druid has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a forest to grow. He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons. Anyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons. Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we might deal with the druid. 
Sabotage the Barrel of Grog, the Barrel of Gunpowder, and the Crate of Cannonballs.	Sinking From Within	The attack on Booty Bay is looming. You'll have to return to Booty Bay quickly and inform the Baron. First, however, it might be a good idea to sabotage some of the pirates' supplies while you're still in their favor. The pirates keep most of their supplies belowdecks, spread out across the entire fleet. 
Use Eric's Charge and Eric's Pocket Potion.	Eric, the Utility Dwarf	Before we get too crazy what with the dragon-killin', let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.""The Swift"" is what they call me, and here's why: I'll dash straight into your enemies - helmet first, mind you - and stun 'em for a few seconds. I also keep a few potions with me for tight spots. Why don't we practice fightin' together? Head out into the field, and try out my abilities. 
Bring Loramus' Body to the Altar of Storms, then protect it while the ritual completes.	The Altar of Storms	Up on the bluffs above our comfy cave is a powerful altar. A powerful DEMONIC altar, guarded by cultists, but powerful nonetheless. If you can reach it, you can use it to bring Loramus back to us. The altar will likely resist your efforts, so you'll have to protect Loramus' body while the ritual completes. Bring the demon hunter back to me afterwards. 
Rescue 4 Drowning Watchmen.	Gasping for Breath	George! I was on my way when it happened. No time to waste. A good half of the town watch was in the area that collapsed. Get in there and save as many as you can. Make sure to get them out of the water and onto shore. I'll make sure they get any aid they need. 
Travel to the West Sanctum, southwest of Falconwing Square and defeat any intruders present there. Report your findings to Ley-Keeper Velania.	Darnassian Intrusions	Besides the constant threat that the Wretched represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of night elf sightings. Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation. The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant. Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious. Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum. 
Kill 5 Death's Step Miscreations at Death's Step in Eastern Plaguelands.	What I Do Best	I remember when I was young, I would sneak off into the Ghostlands and just beat up zombies for hours on end. Nobody even PAID me. I just did it. Now, look in front of you. Those are some serious zombies. I was just about to start beating them up, too. Care to join me? 
Obtain the Rod of Order from Fozruk.	Breaking the Keystone	Opening the Stones of Binding loosened much of my confinement, but a lock still holds me chained. It is the Keystone you see among this circle of stones. And the key is held by one of my captors, the stone watcher Fozruk. You must obtain that key, which the stone watchers call the Rod of Order, from Fozruk and use it to open the Keystone. George, you have done so much to aid me. Just a little more...and my gratitude will shake the very foundations of the earth! 
Destroy the Brain of Iso'rath.	Nightmare	Iso'rath's brain is revealed! The shaman you've saved should keep you somewhat safe amidst his defenses. Strike at the brain and destroy Iso'rath! 
Speak with King Anduin Wrynn at Stormwind Keep.	Joining the Alliance	We have a duty, George. It is our responsibility to spread the Tushui philosophy beyond the edges of the Wandering Isle... and there is no better place to start doing that than here: Stormwind City, heart of the Alliance. Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies. 
Eavesdrop on the Thugs out behind the farmhouse at Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm in Westfall.	Lou's Parting Thoughts	A couple of thugs recently showed up at the farm, causin' all kinds of trouble. I don't know where they came from or who they're working for, but I KNOW they're bad news. I may have overheard 'em talkin' 'bout subjects that might interest you. If you're interested, you'll find the thugs back behind the farmhouse. If you get caught or killed, I don't know you. Never seen ya! Good luck, kid. 
Use the Murloc Leash on a Vile Fin murloc at the Whispering Shore, then return it to Sedrick Calston at Calston Estate.	Ever So Lonely	You work hard your whole life, and what do you get? Killed by a plague. Then you work even harder in undeath, and what do you get? Money, yes, and a small estate with a few pesky hangers-on, but happiness? Not so much. I'm lonely in my old age, George. I need a companion. Use this leash on one of the murlocs at the Whispering Shore to the northwest. You'll have to weaken it first before it can be leashed. Then bring it back to me. 
Plant one of Sambino's modified totems in the sand of Silver Tide Trench.	Totem Modification	Okay, I'll let you in on the real work, since you're looking at me so desperately. This rock is untapped! It's probably richer than a trade prince during a great war! I need samples. More samples. Samples from everywhere! I've modified my earth totems to drill through the sand and store samples of the rock underneath. Go find a nice spot and plant one. The shaking and rumbling will probably attract all the cute, curious wildlife, so maybe you can make some friends while you're at it. 
Find Samir and Mack.	Ain't Too Proud to Beg	Now that you've brought me to safety, I'm afraid I must impose upon your kindness just a bit further. The captain of our ship, Samir, is still out there. Mack too. I'm sure they made it to the sea floor but beyond that I didn't see what became of them. I simply couldn't get by in a place like this without their help. I lost sight of them in a clump of kelp west of where you found me. Please hurry! They couldn't have gotten far... 
Secure the Eastern Ley Line and Western Ley Line beneath Karazhan.	Holding the Lines	Karazhan sits upon a confluence of ley lines. It's why this location was chosen for the tower in the first place... a fact that has not escaped the Legion's notice. If the demons are tapping into these lines of power, they must need their energy for something particularly menacing. You must cut off their access to the ley lines if we're to have a chance of retaking the tower, George. 
Take the Head of Warden Stillwater.	A Blight Upon the Land	With the undead outbreak contained, the time has come for Stillwater and his followers to answer for their crimes. Though we averted a tragedy the likes of which has not been seen since the Scourge invaded, we must ensure that such a thing can never happen again. They will all face true death! Come, George! I will have Stillwater's head! 
Mount a Vermillion Vanguard. Slay 8 Twilight Shadowdrakes.	Battle of Life and Death	Alexstrasza and Deathwing have taken into the skies over Grim Batol! Her plan unravels - the Dragon Queen is outside the Circle of Life she prepared earlier. We'll need to support her with everything we've got. Hurry! Climb aboard one of the Vermillion Vanguard behind me. If we find any Twilight Drakes aiding Deathwing, we will need to kill them off. Mount up, quickly! 
Kill 10 Worgen Renegades.	The Gilneas Liberation Front	The battle over this region still rages, Georgenub. Although we soundly beat back the Gilnean defenses and took Gilneas for the Horde, a small group of rebels managed to escape. The ""Gilneas Liberation Front"" - as they call themselves - make attacks of opportunity against our forces in the field. The rebels have had a few minor victories and now grow brazen in their assaults! The time to strike back is now, Georgenub. Venture south into the wilds of Silverpine and kill any rebel that you cross. 
Bring Zen'Kiki to the Malicia Outpost in Western Plaguelands, then break 4 Captive Plaguebears out of their cages and allow Zen'Kiki to heal them.	Zen'Kiki and the Cultists	While you've been away, I've been trying a different approach on our friend Zen'Kiki. I believe he may have a future as a healer. This is mainly because healing spells never miss. I hear from Field Agent Kaartish that the cultist camp to the east is where the plagued animals are coming from. I hope you don't mind escorting Zen'Kiki over there... perhaps he can help heal some of the plagued animals within the camp. 
Apothecary Thedra in Eversong Woods wants you to bring her 4 Plagued Blood Samples from beasts in the Ghostlands.	The Fallen Courier	What are you standing around for? Can't you see this boy needs immediate attention? By the looks of it, the plague is beginning to take over his body. Within minutes not even a master apothecary like me will be able to save him. The animals south of the river all carry the plague in their blood. Go across the bridge and hunt the plagued beasts there. Bring me enough plagued blood samples and I'll distill a serum capable of saving this blood elf. Hurry! 
Capture Commander Lorna Crowley and return her to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner at the Forsaken Front in Silverpine Forest.	On Her Majesty's Secret Service	Lorna Crowley, daughter of Lord Darius Crowley, is currently at the Gilneas Liberation Front camp, located near the Greymane Wall, to the southeast. Our primary mission is to infiltrate the camp and capture her alive. The Dark Lady believes that she will be able to use Lorna as a bargaining chip against Crowley. I say we just kill her and bring her back as Forsaken, but we must do as the Dark Lady commands. We must hurry before the rest of the Alliance forces arrive. 
Report to Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.	Return to Sentinel Hill	The Defias Brotherhood are not a force to be taken lightly, George. What you witnessed was the birth of a ruthless organization of criminals that will stop at nothing to see Stormwind turned to rubble. I need you to return to Sentinel Hill and let Gryan know that we are sending him troops. I hope it's not too late. 
Kill 20 plagued wildlife with Zen'Kiki by your side. You may kill Hulking Plaguebears, Diseased Wolves, Venom Mist Lurkers, or Plague Lurkers. Return to the Menders' Stead if you become separated from Zen'Kiki.	Zen'Kiki, the Druid	I am Adrine Towhide, a druid of the Cenarion Circle. You can thank us for healing this land, where once there was only death. We accept all who choose to follow the druidic path, regardless of race, faction, or talent. Occasionally that means we enlist a druid who needs more help than others. I'd like you to meet Zen'Kiki. He's pretty new, and he's still learning his craft. Would you mind taking him out with you for a while? You can practice combat on the plagued animals that roam nearby. 
Bring Wazzik's Package to Loramus Thalipedes at the Dreadmaul Furnace in the Blasted Lands.	Enhancing the Stone	<Wazzik finishes packing the materials up in a neatly-wrapped package.>That's all that Loramus asked of us. When you see him, make sure you let him know how much of a help I was. I fear he will not see my hand in this. 
Open the Mosh'Ogg Bounty by fighting a Venture Co. Shredder or by using the sawblade in the Venture Company lumber mill.	The Universal Key	We're going to need something even stronger than those beefy Human hands of yours to open this. And the Venture Company schlubs to the northwest might have just the thing. Last time I was over there, I saw shredders walking around with giant rotating blades on their hands. That's one way to open a box! If you can't find any shredders, you might also try the giant sawblade in their lumber mill, by the lake. 
Kill 8 Bloodsail Sea Dogs and 8 Bloodsail Elder Magi, and bring back the Bloodsail Charts and the Bloodsail Orders.	Details of the Attack	I want to know details, George. Our supremacy over the Bloodsail is due largely in part to our stronghold here in Booty Bay, but intelligence also plays a critical role. The Bloodsail maintain a few meager camps to the south which they call their ""Southern Command."" Well, you're going to raid their excuse for a southern command, find their plans, and slaughter their men. Return with whatever information you can find. 
Report to Thassarian at Andorhal in the Western Plaguelands.	Hero's Call: Western Plaguelands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Thassarian at Andorhal. On the heels of our early victories in Andorhal, the Forsaken have decided to launch a counterattack. Your help is needed to beat back the Scourge and Horde and reclaim lost Andorhal. To reach Andorhal, travel north through the Hillsbrad Foothills and follow the road beyond Chillwind Camp. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Nambria wants you to speak to Recruiter Burns at Stormwind Harbor.	Into The Abyss	The Horde and Alliance are locked in battle with one another in the seas to the west. Below them, a great host of enemies prepares to carry out a plan that could be the undoing of us all. I am sending you to speak with the admiral of the alliance forces. Share with him the vision you have seen. Convince him to focus his attention on the true threat below, before it grows too late...To gain audience with the admiral, you must first enlist with the recruiter at the harbor. 
Kill Grand Magus Doane.	The Grand Magus Doane	<The Bravo Company field kit vibrates.>Good work, kid. I've got some vital intel for you. The magus in the tower is a human named Doane. Damned traitor is working for the Blackrock orcs. I want him dead. Use the key of Ilgalar and get inside that tower. Work your way to the top and show Doane what Bravo Company does with traitors. Rendezvous back at Shalewind Canyon when the deed is done. Keeshan, over and out. 
Report your findings to First Mate Crazz in Booty Bay.	Bloodsail Treachery	The map shows Booty Bay with a red ""X"" drawn precisely at the spot at which you are standing. The scribbled text reads:""Set up your command post here, and bide your time. The Fleet Master will send out word when it's time to make your move.""""I'm placing Lieutenant Bruce in charge here. This time will be different. This time we take Booty Bay once and for all.""The map is held in place with a dagger, placed right through the location of Booty Bay. 
Bring 10 Filled Pure Sample Jars to Laris Geardawdle in Ironforge. If you have trouble finding them, perhaps try to get more clues from Laris.	A Little Slime Goes a Long Way	I'm going to need more samples, George. But--and I don't know how to put this--they have to be pure samples. I know, I know. ""What does 'pure' mean, Laris?"" I'm not sure. I do know that these are corrupt... just like Felwood. Which is what makes my realization so important. The oozes seem to adapt... to take on the aspects of the area they're in. I'll need to find samples that haven't been polluted. But where? Where?!Bah! George, take these containers just in case you find any on your own. 
Kill 4 Alliance Fox Hunters, 4 Bullmastiffs, and 4 Whitetail Foxes in Western Plaguelands.	Foxes and Hounds	These Alliance forces walk around the Plaguelands like they own the place. Well, they don't! This land rightfully belongs to the Dark Lady! As the battle for Andorhal drew to a close, the Alliance forces occupying the Plaguelands scattered. Several of them can be found just east of here, hunting foxes. Prove to them that this is Forsaken territory. Kill the hunters. Kill their hunting dogs. And kill the foxes they hunt, for good measure. 
Bring the Lashtail Hatchling to Corporal Sethman at the Rebel Camp in Northern Stranglethorn.	Just Hatched	While looking through this soldier's possessions, you look down to see a newborn raptor hatchling looking back up at you. Was it following this Kurzen militiaman the whole time? You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements. The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you. Perhaps someone back at the Rebel Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling. 
Warn the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition in Northern Stranglethorn Vale.	Nesingwary Will Know	Great, just what we need, the Gurubashi on the rampage using serpents to lead the charge. Well at least we know that much. It's probably a safe bet that the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition have some insight into this. If they don't they at least know how to fight the serpents. Head there and let them know what you saw here. Let them know that the trolls are using serpents as their weapon. 
Collect 8 Snapjaw Gizzards from Saltwater Snapjaws.	Snapjaws, Lad!	I've got plans to brew up somethin' special for those pesky trolls. Aye, I said for them... a brew they won't ever forget! A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides! I've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more. At the bottom of the Overlook Cliffs to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws. I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew. 
Go to the Dark Iron Embassy and use the Sturdy Manacles to arrest Ambassador Slaghammer.	Seize the Ambassador	The ambassador's betrayal will long haunt me. You must arrest him before he can do further harm, or worse, before he can escape and start planning the next attack. Ironforge is not safe with Ambassador Slaghammer free inside the city. Take these manacles and go to the Dark Iron embassy. It's just to the north of the High Seat, around the rim of the Great Forge. Arrest Ambassador Slaghammer and return with him. 
Bring Yer Papers to Captain Keelhaul.	Your First Day as a Pirate	Ye may be a slayer of Fleet Masters, but rules is rules and orders is orders. And MY orders say that all new pirates start out as swabbies. It's the rule. You're to be working for Captain Keelhaul, the commander of the Riptide. It's the westernmost ship in the fleet, which is parked south of the tip o' the cape. Find him in his captain's chambers, and bring yer papers. 
Kill the D-1000.	The Durnholde Challenge: D-1000	Imprisoned in the old Durnholde Keep arena is a being comprised of pure mercury. The Forsaken have dubbed it the D-1000. Kill the D-1000 and claim your prize! 
Slip through the front lines at Dragonmaw Port and speak with Zaela.	You Say You Want a Revolution	If what you say is true, George, then we have friends within the Dragonmaw Clan. We can support an insurgency from within their ranks and avoid a lot of bloodshed on both sides. I can help, but the most dangerous part is up to you. My Axebite Warriors will launch an offensive on the shores. During the confusion, I need you to slip behind the lines and speak with your revolutionary contact, Zaela. We'll arm the Dragonmaw and overthrow their fel masters! 
Bring the Incriminating Documents to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.	Incriminating Documents	The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods. A diagram of an arcane sanctum is also sketched in good detail. There seem to be numerous notes in a language you don't recognize. As these were carried by a Darnassian spy, it might be a good idea to bring them to the Captain of the Guard - Aeldon Sunbrand. 
Use the disguise to gain access to the chamber, then slay Thar'zul and Elux'ara Darkscorn beneath Karazhan in Deadwind Pass.	The Power of Corruption	The time has come at last. Deep within the cavernous underbelly of Karazhan lies a long-forgotten chamber. Based on what you learned from our demon friend, I believe this is where its mistress dwells. This demon's master must come from the highest ranks of the Burning Legion. This does not bode well for Karazhan. We need to secure Deadwind Pass, George. You must find this demon and destroy it. 
Find Page 14 of the Green Hills of Stranglethorn.	The Green Hills of Stranglethorn	One page! I only need one more page! Master Nesingwary's novel ran into a bit of an... accident <Barnil shoots an accusing glance over at Spanks>... and we misplaced some of the pages. I've been asking your fellow adventurers to look for the missing pages, and they've been quite helpful, but one page still eludes me. I'm sure you're awfully busy with other matters, but while you're out in the jungle, would you mind looking for it? 
Escort the Horde Negotiator to the main hall in Dragonmaw Port to meet with Warchief Mor'ghor of the Dragonmaw. Speak with Ornak on the coast if you lose your Negotiator.	Madness	Our last two negotiators haven't returned from speaking with the Dragonmaw Warchief. I think we might need to flex a little bit of muscle. This time, I want YOU to accompany the negotiator. Their Warchief might think twice once he realizes the Horde is full of battle-hardened heroes like yourself. Simply escort our negotiator into the main hold in the center of Dragonmaw Port and look menacing. 
Board the Pincer X2 from Voldrin's Hold and aid in securing Darkbreak Cove.	Full Circle	We've located the beast that destroyed our ships. It makes its lair in Darkbreak Cove, a giant underwater cavern bordering the abyss. This time we're ready. The gnomes have been engineering a beauty for us back at Stormwind, and it's packing firepower that'll make that fiend wet itself. When the Pincer X2 pulls up to dock beside the ship, make your way on board and help out however you can. We'll be right behind you. 
Use Olaf's Shield Wall and Olaf's Mighty Shout.	Olaf, the Big Fella'	You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as dwarves go. I make sure that my two brothers here don't get into too much trouble. They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me. I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me! Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead! I can protect you, too. Come on, let's go practice for a bit. I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you. 
Obtain Cozzle's Key from Foreman Cozzle, then obtain the Fuel Regulator Blueprints.	Cozzle's Plan	I may be of Darkspear birth, but I spent my childhood here, in Stranglethorn Vale. I've seen everything there is to see here in Stranglethorn, but the most offensive is the devastation that the Venture Company has done to the riverbed. To make things worse, Foreman Cozzle and his crew have been increasing their activity, and I suspect they have some new plan. Succeed where I failed, George: Kill Cozzle, obtain his key, and steal the blueprints from his apartment. 
Nazgrim wants you to see what lies in the broken Alliance crate north of The Immortal Coil.	Pay Attention!	Listen, Human. It's not that I don't appreciate the rescue and all, but this is a dire situation. You have to pay better attention out there! I was watching, and you passed right over a busted alliance crate. There's bound to be something in there that could help me and my boys. How about you get out there and take a look-see, hrm? 
Bring the Flawless Draenethyst Sphere to Kum'isha the Collector in Blasted Lands.	Kum'isha's Endeavors	A glimmering sphere sits before you. You sense that this item would be of great value to someone within the Blasted Lands. 
Search Tor'Watha to the southeast of the Farstrider Retreat for Spearcrafter Otembe and bring Otembe's Hammer to Arathel Sunforge at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.	The Spearcrafter's Hammer	The Amani and the sin'dorei have a long history of mutual dislike and open hostility. That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, George. I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work. It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency. If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon. 
Join the assault on the black dragonflight.	And the Sky Streaked Red	With Deathwing otherwise occupied, we have a grim and daunting task ahead of us, under charge of the queen herself. The black dragonflight is to be wiped out. I would welcome your aid in this, if it is offered. As soon as you are ready, I will send you with the next flight joining the attack. 
Free 10 Enslaved elementals by slaying them at the Twilight Citadel.	Unbinding	Look, if there's one thing I know, it's elementals. I've been able to really gain an appreciation for how they feel. Let me tell you, they don't appreciate being enslaved one bit! So, what I'm saying here is that if you were to free the enslaved elementals, I'm sure that not only would they show their gratitude, they'd also likely turn on their masters. Sounds like a win-win to me, George. 
Report to Yancey Grillsen at the waterfall north of Booty Bay.	Getting In With the Bloodsail	These plans are... interesting. Firallon, you're smarter than this! Look, he has all three ships devoted to cannon fire, and only a few men coming in through the tunnel. He can never take Booty Bay with three ships and a dozen footmen. And he knows that. No, they've got something else planned... and you're going to find out what it is. Speak to Yancey Grillsen, the Bloodsail Recruiter, just to the north of town. That's right, George. You'd better hope that they don't recognize your face. 
Use the Banner of the Fallen to mark 7 Fallen Stonard Warriors.	Marking the Fallen	Many warriors have met death to bring us victory, George. The fate of a true orc. I have seen the way the Alliance loots the bodies of our fallen, clutching at our goods like packrats. They will not defile our fallen heroes on this field. Take these wards with you to the Bloodmire. Place them on the bodies of our fallen warriors. I will be watching, to see how many have fallen, and to honor their sacrifice. Let us hope the spirits give us aid for our respect. 
Slay Brothogg the Slavedriver inside Emberstone Mine.	Slaves to No One	I was one of the few that escaped, George. When the Forsaken took over our town and our mine, they treated us with utmost cruelty. Those of us who were weak and could not endure hard labor were worked to death by the abomination known as Brothogg. My wife was among his victims, Mechanic, and I swore that one day her death would be avenged. I am too frail now, but you can deliver justice... for my wife... for Gilneas! 
Bring the Cursed Eye of Paleth to Glorin Steelbrow at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands.	The Eye of Paleth	Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light. This must be the foul Eye of Paleth that damned these sailors' souls. Such corruption should be purged. Perhaps a priest in Menethil Harbor could help you. 
Report to Fleet Master Firallon within the Crimson Veil in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	Attracting Attention	Swabbie George! This is a sad day fer ol' Cap'n Keelhaul. Today I lose m'best swabbie. A letter's come in from Fleet Master Firallon. Apparently he's heard about the excellent swabbin' y'been doin', and he wants t'take ye aboard the Crimson Veil as his Jack o' Swords and third mate. She's moored just next t'the Riptide. Piracy career-wise, this's a big step fer ye, Swabbie George. I recommend y'take his offer. Dismissed! 
Examine the Mound of Loose Dirt at the Yorgen Farmstead.	The Yorgen Worgen	My kinsmen at Raven Hill are concerned with curing the feral worgen in these forests. The condition itself cannot be lifted, but sanity can be restored to those not too far gone. While most here have proven beyond help, we keep an eye out for those that retain vestiges of their minds... attachments to their old lives. I've seen a lone worgen lurking the Yorgen Farmstead, digging in a pile of dirt between the buildings...could you check out that pile and see if he's left anything? 
Survive a Massive Wave of Zombies.	Basic Botany	HELP! HELP! Crazed undead are attacking my farm! That psycho warden over at the Sludge Fields is probably responsible for this mess. Help me fight off the zombies! 
Kill 8 Ironmarch Grunts.	Attack of the Iron Horde	We received reports of the Dark Portal turning red right before the attack. They call themselves the Iron Horde. Their army is extremely well equipped, and their numbers appear to be unending. They have already taken Okril'lon Hold and Nethergarde Keep. Our troops on the frontlines could use your help, Mechanic. 
Kill the Blacksmith Verringtan.	Do it for Twinkles	Warden Stillwater sent me out into the field to investigate the outbreak. When I arrived, Twinkles and I were charged by the lumbering monstrosity known as Verringtan. I was knocked off of Twinkles and immediately ran for my life. Twinkles, though, stayed behind and fought the beast off. Alas, she was defeated and then summarily planted in the soil as if she were some type of glorious star pony seedling. She gave her life to defend me. Vengeance must be mine! If for nothing else, do it for Twinkles! 
Enter the Defias Hideout and follow the trail of homeless to the Deadmines dungeon. Enter the Deadmines dungeon and use the Incense Burner to see into the past.	A Vision of the Past	This incense will put your body and mind in a deep meditative state. Once the trance begins you will be pulled into the spirit world. Do not fight the trance once it has begun, George. Allow the spirits to show you what they know. You must leave now. Go to the Deadmines, a place which I am told holds great significance in the history of Westfall. Once inside, use the incense. You may enter the Deadmines through the old farmhouse south of here. Follow the homeless. Return to Gryan with your discovery. 
Obtain Joseph's Hunting Blade from The Lone Hunter in Eastern Plaguelands.	I'm Not Supposed to Tell You This	My daddy always kept two swords: one for fighting with men, and one for hunting the animals. I wasn't supposed to touch his swords, but I knew where he hid them. One day, he told my mommy that he was going to fight a ""lone hunter"" in the hills to the east, but he brought his animal sword with him! When he came back, he didn't have his sword with him. When daddy comes back, he'll be so happy when I give him his animal sword! Will you go and find it? 
Collect 6 Wolfsbane.	In Time, All Will Be Revealed	The Dark Lady has sent you and Arthura here for a very specific purpose. Before I tell you more, we must make preparations. Head east into the forest of Gilneas and search near the trees and rocks of the region for a special plant known as wolfsbane. Gather as much of the wolfsbane as you can carry and return to me. Our mission here goes far beyond the scope of the battlefield, George. In time, all will be revealed. 
Use the Mistmantle Family Ring at Manor Mistmantle, north of town.	Mistmantle's Revenge	I'm afraid I cannot give Tobias the answers he seeks. But I can help you find the only person who can...Stalvan Mistmantle. Take the ring into the woods to the north, to Manor Mistmantle, where Stalvan's body was buried. Enter, and hold the ring before you. Let the waning moon pour its light through the ring, and the spirits will answer your call. Take heed, George. The questions of the living can offer more comfort than the answers of the dead. 
Pick up a Swabbie's Mop on the deck of the Riptide, then keep the deck clean for 2 minutes.	Swabbing Duty	I want the surface of the Riptide t'shine like a star ruby, Swabbie George. I keep a tight ship around here, and it's swabbies like you that make it happen! Well, what're y'waitin' for, y'cockle-brained bilgerat? Head updecks and start swabbin'! 
Obtain the Corroded Key from Kliklak to unlock the Half-buried Footlocker in the Kelp'thar Forest.	Kliklak's Craw	You are pleasantly surprised to find that after being mangled and masticated by a sea crab, this map is still quite legible. It clearly indicates that a footlocker was buried in the Kelp'thar Forest behind a gigantic mollusk. A well-drawn sketch on the back of the map shows that the owner, along with his key, was eaten by an overgrown crustacean named Kliklak. 
Kill 12 Kobold Diggers.	"""I TAKE Candle!"""	Back before those damned kobolds gave me a permanent limp I used to be William Pestle's number one candle supplier. Hell, I even came up with the line ""I TAKE CANDLE!"" Yea, that was me. Kobold would say ""You no take candle!"" and I'd just respond ""I TAKE CANDLE!"" and then bash their brains in!<Jimb drifts off for a second.>Good times... The best times. Now? Can't even use the bathroom without assistance. You want to help me? Kill me some kobolds. You'll find a good load of 'em in the nearby mine. 
Search for Rheastrasza.	Devastation	The coast is clear. If Rheastrasza or the egg were able to miraculously evade Deathwing's flames, they would probably need your assistance as soon as possible. 
Report to Magistrate Solomon at Lakeshire in Redridge.	Triumphant Return	Return to Lakeshire and let Solomon know that the Blackrock invasion has been stopped. Make sure he understands the cost at which our freedom came - that we lost five of our finest heroes to save Redridge and ultimately, Stormwind. You are the last surviving member of Bravo Company, George. It is up to you to keep its legacy alive. Dismissed. 
Speak with Fiona at Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.	Journey's End	I've had just about enough of the funk of this place. Undead stink is bad enough, and then you add mushrooms to the mix? I hate mushrooms! I'm going to head back to Light's Hope Chapel, George... and I'm taking Tarenar and Fiona with me. I think we've all earned a well-deserved break. Let me give you this. It's my hearthstone - you can use it to travel instantly back to Light's Hope. I won't need it - I'm going to be riding in the caravan. In the FRONT SEAT. 
Speak with Madame Eva in Darkshire.	Supplies from Darkshire	Oh, what is a poor old man to do? I need some supplies from Darkshire, but the village is so far away and I am so old and feeble...I would never make the trip. Can you go to Darkshire and bring me back some ghost hair thread? You can get it from Madame Eva at her home on the Darkshire square. 
Kill 10 Zin'jatar Ravagers.	Vengeful Heart	These are the naga that took our people. I only need one to interrogate, kill the rest. Show no mercy, Mechanic, for they would surely show us none. 
Use the Westfall Stew to feed 20 Homeless People around Sentinel Hill in Westfall.	Feeding the Hungry and the Hopeless	Yes, I heard about the Furlbrow murders. It is very tragic, but such tragedy is a way of life in Westfall. There are many people here who simply no longer have the means or inclination to keep themselves fed. They have given up hope. Do you understand what it means to be left so hopeless as to stop caring about life? We must work together to show them that there is hope. That with the dawning day a better life comes. Take my mother's Westfall stew and help feed the homeless around Sentinel Hill. 
Recover an Informational Pamphlet, Secret Journal, an Issue of the Moonbrook Times and Mysterious Propaganda.	Propaganda	We've noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless of the area. Something or someone is getting them all riled up. Now whoever is behind all this is getting more organized. Just recently a group of thugs came through here handing out pamphlets. Enter Moonbrook and look for evidence. Propaganda, leaflets, whatever... Bring whatever you find back to me. Maybe we can find the source through the writings. 
Bring the Gob Squad past the northern Dragonmaw Gate to the entrance of Grim Batol. If you are separated from the Gob Squad, return to Warlord Krogg in Wyrms' Bend to be reassigned.	Pressing Forward	Good work so far. We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate. I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun. Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly. 
Kill Tharil'zun and Gath'Ilzogg.	Showdown at Stonewatch	Only the Blackrock high command remains, George. They're all holed up in Stonewatch Keep, directly south of our position here at Keeshan's Post. I want you and the rest of Bravo Company to enter Stonewatch and put an end to the Blackrock orc invasion. George, no survivors. 
Speak with Vindicator Maraad at the Shattered Beachhead in Blasted Lands.	Iron Horde Invasion	By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Vindicator Maraad at the Shattered Beachhead in Blasted Lands. Use the portal at the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind to head directly to the front line. This new threat is known only as the Iron Horde. They have taken over the Dark Portal and must be stopped. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Witness the Stormpike Apocalypse.	Stormpike Apocalypse	Before we continue, let us have a moment of silence for our fallen brother, Orkus, for without him, we would have been destroyed by the Stormpike onslaught. This is for you, brother!<Cromush takes a knee.>Now, George, do not think that I forgot your part in all of this! That is why you get the honors of detonating the goblin pocket-nukes. Are you ready? FOR THE HORDE! 
Open your map to find an active Legion invasion in Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms. Go to the invasion site and stop the demons!	Protect the Home Front	The Legion hasn't just invaded this city. Their evil is spreading across Azeroth, threatening the far corners of our world. We must seek them out and stop them, everywhere their darkness touches. We've dispatched scouts around the world to watch for Legion activity. As invasions arise, we'll mark the locations on your map. Make them suffer, George! 
Find and speak to Admiral Dvorek under the southern terrace in the Ruins of Vashj'ir. Use Wavespeaker Valoren's sea horse to reach the forward post quickly.	Looking Forward	The Admiral used the information you gathered for him to make a forward post under the terrace to our west. He's been preparing there for some kind of attack against the naga. You should go to him immediately and inform him of the scope of what you've witnessed. Our force is small, and I fear for our soldiers if we charge in too recklessly. Take my sea horse. It knows the way. 
Report to Pilot Hammerfoot at South Gate Outpost in Loch Modan.	Hero's Call: Loch Modan!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Pilot Hammerfoot at South Gate Outpost. The destruction of the Stonewrought Dam and the resurgence of the kobolds and troggs has the mountaineers stretched thin. Reinforcements are desperately needed! Travel east through South Gate Pass from eastern Dun Morogh to reach South Gate Outpost. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Speak with Meagan Tillman to make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your home.	Home Is Where the Hearth Is	I don't know about you, but all this running around has got me thirsty! Why don't we head over to the Pig and Whistle Tavern and rest our legs over some cool pints of moonberry juice? While we're there, speak with Meagan the innkeeper to make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a flight master nearby, you can use your hearthstone to return to the inn. Not only is it faster than a gryphon, but you'll save a few copper in the process! 
Bring 8 Sin'dorei Armaments to Velendris Whitemorn in Eversong Woods.	Lost Armaments	The Wretched grow bolder every day, George. They've achieved enough coordination to launch an attack on Sunsail Anchorage. As if that weren't embarrassing enough, most of our weapons were left behind when they attacked. Bring me back our armaments so that we may show those ruffians who's boss. 
Steal the Gnoll Battle Plans, Gnoll Orders and Gnoll Strategy Guide.	Still Assessing the Threat	Damned worthless gnolls are up to no good. I can feel it in my bones. Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on Lakeshire. I need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information that you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southeast of here. Bring back whatever you find. 
Bring Joseph's Hunting Blade to Chromie.	A Strange Historian	That sword belonged to Joseph Redpath, Pamela's father - though you probably already knew that. I wish Joseph could again be with his daughter, but it cannot be so. His soul was twisted by the Scourge, and he became a monster. Pamela's fate is sealed, but perhaps we can change Joseph's fate. A strange gnome arrived here at this tower not long ago. Her name is Chromie. Take that sword to her. I have a feeling she will be able to help us. 
Speak with Watcher Sarah Ladimore in Darkshire.	The Daughter Who Lived	I should have told you this earlier...How do I put this...Morgan may have believed that his family was all dead, but, in fact, his daughter Sarah Ladimore is now a Watcher. She's always been troubled by the... circumstances... surrounding her father's death. Perhaps you could go to bring the news to her. 
Find Pilot Hildelve north of Helm's Bed Lake.	The Lost Pilot	My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it! Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot. It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls north of Helm's Bed Lake, west of the tunnel. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried. Please, George. Find him. 
Collect 10 Bloodstone Amulets from members of the Syndicate.	First Blood	Be prepared, George. You will cast the first blood upon this land for us. The Syndicate, as they call themselves, are cowardly humans who betray even their own kind. Their isolation will make them easy prey. Travel north, slay any Syndicate members you find, and claim Northfold Manor in the name of the Forsaken. Bring me the Bloodstone Amulets they wear as proof of your conquest. 
Feed the Hungry Mine Spider 12 Murlocs from the Western Strand.	Coastal Delicacies!	My spiders are hungry and agitated! They haven't eaten for days and are starting to sample our human captives. We can't have that. We need those humans for use in the Sludge Fields. I want you to take one of my hungry mine spiders out and feed it murlocs from the Western Strand, south of here. Whatever you kill, it'll eat! The more the better! 
Defend the Earthen Ring camp until the naga retreat.	Backed Into a Corner	The naga are upon us, Mechanic. Aid us in fightin' dem off! 
Head to Bambala in Northern Stranglethorn Vale to find the Darkspear emissary.	To Bambala	Da first place we check gonna be da place most likely to be attacked first, Bambala. Bambala be dangerously close to da troll city Zul'Gurub... It make for an easy target. Maybe we find da emissary dere. Hopefully it ain't too late. 
Escort Professor Phizzlethorpe to the cave and back.	Goggle Boggle	Now that we are full-fledged Blackwater Raiders it is our job to help Mr. O'Breen locate the lost elven treasure. It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. The doctor has constructed some goggles that will help. He needs the goggles charged with the energy derived from the enchanted stone in the cave just up the hill. But the cave is cursed! When we get close, we get ambushed. Defend me and I can harness the energy from the stone into the goggles. 
Get Grandma's Good Clothes.	I Can't Wear This	What was it you wanted again? Oh, right. The evacuation orders. Well I can't be expected to go out in public like this, can I? Go get me my good clothes. They're on the clothesline right outside.<You struggle in vain to convince Grandma Wahl that what she's wearing will do.>You young people truly have no manners. Were you raised by ogres? Now go get my clothes, sweetie. 
Kill 10 Horde attackers within Highbank.	Welcome to Highbank!	Welcome to the highlands, soldier. You're here just in time. Horde troops just launched an assault from the air. Step up and do something about it. Clear them out! 
Use the Enchanted Conch Shell to rescue 6 Drowning Soldiers.	Pay It Forward	You are now able to move about this realm more freely and without fear of drowning. This is where our work begins. First, you have many allies nearby who are drowning as we speak. As I saved you, you must save them. I have enchanted the shell you brought me. Use it to rescue your friends. Hurry now! 
Find and kill 5 Worgen Infiltrators within Brill.	Annihilate the Worgen	These worgen must be dealt with, and quickly. Our first priority is to eliminate any which may have infiltrated Brill. I want you to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity here in Brill, George. We know that these worgen can hide in the shadows, so look for any signs you can find... footsteps, kicked-up rocks... anything. 
Report to Rofilian Dane at the Nethergarde Mines in the Blasted Lands.	Heartstrike	We don't have any hope of taking the Nethergarde Mines from the Alliance... at least not yet. Nethergarde is well-defended, and their supply routes are established and strong. Our goal, then, is to damage their economy. We can't take the mine by force, but with surgical strikes we can drastically reduce the mine's efficiency. I have men creating a distraction outside the mines. Head east, sneak into the mines, and speak with Rofilian Dane for your assignment. 
Bury the Light-Touched Blades in the bodies of 10 Slain Scourge Troopers.	Buried Blades	The Noxious Glade is a quagmire, both literally and figuratively. There's enough Scourge up there to give us trouble for the rest of both of our lifetimes. They can re-animate the weaker ones when they die, George. They will never stop coming if we don't do something. Take these blades and drive them through the corpses of any Scourge troopers you find. The blade is simple, but its enchantment will prevent the dead bones from being reanimated. Forever. 
Report to Bronwyn Hewstrike at the Explorers' League Digsite on the Cape of Stranglethorn.	Hero's Call: The Cape of Stranglethorn!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Bronwyn Hewstrike at the Explorers' League Digsite. The Explorers' League expedition needs your help to safeguard its site and findings from marauding ogres. Travel south from Northern Stranglethorn Vale and follow the road to the Explorers' League Digsite. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Speak with Evelyn Thorn at the Training Hall in Stormwind.	Meet with Evelyn Thorn	I just received a scroll from Evelyn Thorn in Stormwind. She wants you to pay a visit to the Training Hall in Stormwind. She doesn't mention specifics, but I got the impression that it was a matter of some importance. 
Use Moanah's Breathstone on 10 Imprisoned Warriors in The Clutch.	Decompression	I simply cannot bear the thought of so many others like this warrior imprisoned, surrounded by naga. Something must be done to rescue them! Try this, George. Use it on the prison cells to make them buoyant. If we can get them to the surface, at least they stand a chance at being rescued. 
Hop in Fiona's Caravan and ride to Northpass Tower.	Nobody to Blame but Myself	This is my fault. I... I ignored his warnings, his complaints, everything. I couldn't help myself - I saw those Scourge just beyond the tower, and I... I HAD to go kill them. Argus says that Gidwin was taken northwest, and that's our only lead, so that's where we'll head. Northdale and the Argent Crusade be damned! We're getting Gidwin back from those Scourge trash. 
Collect 6 Ditty Bags from Deceased Bogpaddle Privateers.	Can't Take It With Them	Any shipping crew I had that you don't see hanging around this camp are DEAD! Those were some fine goblins, but what's worse is they're all still out there! It's a TRAGEDY! I mean, it's a tragedy they still have all their stuff! It's horrifying to think of all the perfectly good materials and coins sitting out there in the water. Hey! You can do me a favor! If you're killing gilblins out there, go get the ditty bags off my old crewmen! C'mon, they're not gonna need it anymore! Be real! 
Kill General Thorg'izog, Dragon-Lord Neeralak, and High Warlock Xi'lun.	Glory Amidst Chaos	You and my son are going back to that mountain. There's three orcs who survived the attack, and we won't rest until they're dead. That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three. General Thorg'izog crawled back into the Firegut Furnace, and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak. Xi'lun is in the back of the Skull Warren, plotting with his fellow warlocks. Leave your mark, George. Topple these corrupt Blackrock orcs once and for all. 
Slay 6 Stonard Ogres.	Tides of Darkness	The battle's proceeding just the way I wanted it. With their warriors nearly exhausted, I've sent in our cavalry. What I wasn't expecting was ogres. Our knights are well matched against the brutes, but they're going to need help. I need you back on the field right away, George. Few can bring down an ogre on foot, but I think I can count on you. Don't disappoint me. 
Return to Nimboya at Grom'gol Base Camp and show him your Lashtail Hatchling's new skull.	Favored Skull	Your pet raptor seems to have found a new toy: a skull, from a nearby troll skull pile. What sets this skull apart from the rest is beyond you, but for some reason, she won't put it down. Nimboya at Grom'gol Base Camp seems to be somewhat of a skull expert, judging by the skull piles he keeps. Maybe he'll have some idea what makes this one so special. 
Drag 3 Dead Zin'jatar Raiders into the open water over Glimmerdeep Gorge to the south.	A Distracting Scent	Predators will smell these dead naga from nearly a mile away. Soon we'll find ourselves fighting just to get in and out of the cave. Care to help me clean up? Just over the ridge to the south is Glimmerdeep Gorge. If you drag the corpses from the eastern exit of the cave over there to the gorge and cut them loose, the wildlife will pick them clean before they hit the sea floor. Just steer clear of the sharks as much as you can. 
Kill Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar.	Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar	The Fathom-Lord is here, at the far side of the ruins. He's still injured from our last battle. I'll leave this pleasure to you. Make sure he doesn't get away this time. 
Deliver the Package for Stormpike to Mountaineer Stormpike in Loch Modan.	Stormpike's Delivery	The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes. So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon. The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan. If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him? My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan. 
Use Two-Shoed Lou's Old House at the back of the Jangolode Mine in Westfall.	Livin' the Life	Listen, I really shouldn't be talkin' to you, but I owe Horatio a favor or two. I don't really know nothin' about what happened to the Furlbrows, but I might be able to point you in the right direction.<Lou hands you a large crate.>That crate used to be my home before I struck it rich. Now I'm livin' the life every hobo dreams of! Right, so you take that there livin' crate and head to the Jangolode Mine, southwest of here. Head to the back of the mine and once there, hide in the crate. 
Slay Ur'Goz, Sku'Bu, and Neph'Lahim.	Unplug L'ghorek	L'ghorek is the ancient that rests upon the shelf across from us. It is being controlled and its life energies slowly consumed by something immense beneath us. There is a cave known as the Undershell down below L'ghorek. In that cave are three powerful ogre magi that are maintaining a ritual connecting the thing below with the ancient. You must kill these three to disconnect L'ghorek. 
Bring Zen'Kiki to the top of the hill east of the Menders' Stead, then use him to summon and kill 7 Diseased Hawks.	A Different Approach	Among other things, Zen'Kiki needs to work on his spell accuracy. I could see his wrath spells spiraling out of control even from here! In fact, I used them as a marker to follow your progress through the woods. Perhaps we can use Zen'Kiki another way. Take him up to the top of the hill just to our east. The diseased hawks that circle above that hill must be destroyed. Ask Zen'Kiki to shoot at these hawks. Even if he can't hit them, he will distract them so you can finish them off. 
Learn Rhea's true identity.	Rhea Revealed	As I hinted earlier, I am no ordinary goblin. You may have already guessed my true identity. Allow me to show you my true form. As you have proven yourself trustworthy, I will also share with you the details of my plan. 
	Nathanos Blightcaller	 
Remy ""Two Times"" wants you to speak with Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.	A Fishy Peril	George, there's a new threat in Elwynn Forest! Murlocs are swimming up the streams of eastern Elwynn, scaring away fish and attacking gentle folk! I warned Marshal Dughan, but he's more worried about the gnolls and the bandits. He's not convinced that the murlocs are a danger. Please, George, speak to Dughan and persuade him to send more troops to the east! 
Speak with Apprentice Mirveda and then protect her from the Scourge ambush.	Unexpected Results	Something's wrong, George. I sense the presence of Scourge. Be ready to fight them! 
Kill any 20 Shadowhide Gnolls.	Shadowhide Extinction	Now that every Blackrock orc south of Lake Everstill is nothing more than ash and cinder, we can turn our attention to the Shadowhide gnoll army of Galardell Valley, directly north of here. I want you to head out there and kill 'em all, George! Initiate Operation: Extinction, soldier. For Bravo Company and for the Alliance! 
Recover Dempsey's Torso, Dempsey's Appendages and Dempsey's Giblets.	From the Belly of the Beast	I think we can rebuild him. Perhaps if we put him back together he can give us information about Crowley. We must kill every crocolisk in this marsh until we find the rest of Sean Dempsey's body! From the belly of the beast this man will be reborn! 
Loot 10 Banshee's Bells from the shore of the Thondroril River.	Greasing the Wheel	Sorry about that. I was pretty sure you were one of those spider-beasts, doing a bad Human impression. How do you do? Gidwin Goldbraids, at your service. I'm in a bit of a hurry back to my caravan, but I was wondering if you might do me one last favor? My pal Fiona runs a small shop, and she could probably use some of these herbs that grow along the river shore. I'm thinking if we give her some nice herbs, she'll be MUCH less likely to murder me. That's the plan, anyway. 
Travel to Corin's Crossing to the south and slaughter the Scourge that inhabit the town. Collect 7 pieces of Living Rot. Use the Mortar and Pestle to grind the Living Rot into Coagulated Rot.	To Kill With Purpose	Greetings, stranger! You've entered the heart of the Plaguelands. I hope you brought your undead-killing gear with you. The plague spreads more slowly these days, so the Cult of the Damned has stepped up production in order to keep the land brown and dead, as they like it. I've got a plan to stop them. Take my mortar and pestle, and use it on living rot from the undead creatures in Corin's Crossing to the southeast. We're going to make a little present for the cultists! 
Deliver the Battle for Hillsbrad to Warden Stillwater at the Sludge Fields in Hillsbrad Foothills.	The Battle for Hillsbrad	The journal documents the last 62 days of Clerk Horrace Whitesteed's life. In it is written damning allegations against Warden Stillwater and his activities at the Sludge Fields. You should show this to the warden. He will undoubtedly have an explanation for what is written in this journal. 
Collect 8 Spiralung shells and give them to stranded Nespirah Survivors.	Shelled Salvation	A lot of the men haven't made it to the cave yet. It's a safe bet that they're stranded at the vents on the ridge above us. We found some spiralung shells on the way here. They don't produce much air, but it was enough for us to make the cave. I need to stay here to count heads and get them back on their feet as they arrive. Do me a favor - go collect those spiralung shells, get them to any of my men that are still up on the ridge, and give them a swift kick in the arse so that they get moving. 
Kill Qiaga the Keeper and collect the Shell of Shadra.	The Shell of Shadra	The final piece is all we need to burn Shadra out for good. The Shell of Shadra is held by the spider god's last living high priestess, Qiaga the Keeper. She stands atop the Altar of Zul, guarded by other fanatical zealots. You've got to climb that altar to the top and take her out! She'll have the Shell in her possession. Bring it back here. 
Deliver the Slabchisel Report to Captain Stoutfist in Menethil Harbor.	Onwards to Menethil	This news needs to get to Menethil as soon as possible. I'll send you along on my fastest ram, George. He knows the way, just make sure you're steady in the saddle and hold on tight. Don't dawdle around the camp. We've got to send word quickly! 
	The Heart of Mokk	 
Report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold in the Blasted Lands.	Okrilla and the Blasted Lands	I have one final dispatch to deliver to you, George. It comes from Dreadmaul Hold, to the south, in the Blasted Lands. Warmatron Okrilla is waging battle against the Alliance forces of Nethergarde Keep, and she needs the assistance of a stout Mechanic. You immediately sprung to mind. Travel south into the Blasted Lands, then head west. Good luck, George. 
Report to Commander Aggro'gosh at Grom'gol Base Camp in Northern Stranglethorn.	Northern Stranglethorn: The Fallen Empire	Commander Aggro'gosh is looking for devoted members of the Horde to assist him and his mission in Grom'gol. If you're interested, just hop on up to the top of that zeppelin tower and board the Grom'gol zeppelin. It's that easy! Seriously, Stranglethorn is the place to be right now... there's plenty of action to be found, and not nearly as much cataclysmic damage as, say... Stonetalon Mountains. I wish I could go with you. 
Use the Banshee Mirror to capture 10 SI:7 Agents.	Cry of the Banshee	So you are to be our savior? Very well then, I will bond myself with you. Through this bond I will be able to see through your eyes and communicate with you in the field. According to the plans you brought to us, the Stormpike have enlisted the aid of SI:7 at Sofera's Naze, to the north. SI:7 are comprised solely of humans - humans that we are able to use to our benefit. Take my mirror and travel north. Engage in combat with the SI:7 and bring them near death. Once they are injured, use the mirror. 
Speak to Farseer Gadra to enter your Spirit Trance.	The Looming Threat	Can ya feel how angry the elements be? They be wantin' to attack us and consume us even as we just arrive. We need ta calm dem, but that kinda wisdom only comes from knowin' what's riling them up in da first place. Come sit with me by da fire. Let yaself get lost in da flames... let ya spirit peer into the true threat. 
Search the tunnel under the Dawning Woods Catacombs for the Lightforged Crest.	Buried Below	<You attach the arch to the rod, and the artifact is nearly complete. A large gap still sits at the center of the holy symbol's head.><Once again you feel it tug your arm, urging you towards the hole in the wall and the winding tunnel ahead. The last piece must be through there.> 
Drag the Abandoned Bloodwash Crate to the Forbidden Sea off the coast of the Red Reaches.	The Future of the Rockpool	The Rockpool tadpoles left upon this crate appear tired, scared, and nearly dried out. They need to be taken to the water, and quickly. Perhaps if you can drag this crate across the beach and into the Forbidden Sea, far off the coast of the Red Reaches, then they will have a chance of escaping, and the Rockpool murlocs may live on... 
Find someone at Crown Guard Tower who will join your caravan.	Traveling Companions	While we're waiting here at this tower, we might as well see if anybody else is headed to Light's Hope Chapel. The more, the merrier, I say! Ask around to see if anybody wants to join us on our trip. I'm sure you can find somebody who's headed to Light's Hope. 
Obtain Control Runes from Dark Cultists and Shadowmages, then use the Overcharged Mote on them to destroy 3 Plague Disseminators.	Postponing the Inevitable	You have a keen eye to have seen me here, hidden among the grasses. Ahead of us lies the Fungal Vale, an area that the Scourge still cling tightly to. They use floating constructs to continually re-plague the land, keeping it vile and polluted. The devices are controlled with runes, which are held by dark adepts and shadowmages. Take the controlling runes that these cultists hold, aim them at the plague disseminators, then overcharge them with this mote. The results should be amusing. 
Obtain 20 Rotberries, 5 Disembodied Arms, and 1 pile of Flesh Giant Foot Scrapings.	Counter-Plague Research	I once worked for the so-called ""Banshee-Queen"", Sylvanas, as an apothecary. I used to admire her, but something's changed within her. She's not herself anymore. I broke my vows with the Forsaken and joined the Crusade. Now, I use my knowledge of alchemy to seek a counter-plague agent. And the Plaguewood is the perfect place to do so. I need to resupply a few reagents, any of which can be found within the Plaguewood. I'll pay you if you can find any of these items. 
Kill 5 Blackrock Sergeants using the Blackrock Cudgel of Discipline. Defeat them quickly, before they have a chance to unmask you.	Abuse of Power	George? Eitrigg here. It sounds like you have earned Thorg'izog's trust, and he's assigned you to discipline duty. This is fortunate. We need you to take out his sergeants. You'll find them on wolfback, outside of the Blackrock Stronghold in the Fields of Honor. Use that cudgel on them, several times, until they die. You'll have to act fast, because if they realize you're not one of them, they can unmask you. Strike quickly and ferociously, George. 
Report to Fiona on the eastern bank of the Thondroril River in the Eastern Plaguelands.	Hero's Call: Eastern Plaguelands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Fiona on the east bank of the Thondroril River. The Argent Crusade needs your help to win back the Eastern Plaguelands from the grasp of the Scourge. To reach the Eastern Plaguelands, cross the Thondroril River from the Western Plaguelands and look for Fiona on the eastern bank. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Obtain the Kurzen Compound Prison Records and the Kurzen Compound Officers' Dossier.	The Fate of Kurzen	Hello, Mechanic. We are soldiers of Stormwind, and rebels from Kurzen's Compound, a large outpost that you'll find just to the southeast of here. We were under the command of Colonel Kurzen, until he and those close to him started to descend into madness...We rebelled, set up camp here, and stood against Kurzen. Now, my sources are telling me Kurzen has disappeared. I trust my source, but it would help to hear from a third party. Please, head into the compound and find some documentation of his fate. 
Gather 6 Dusky Lumps from Venom Web Spiders.	Dusky Crab Cakes	I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky ""Crab"" Cakes are really made from spider meat! I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks! If you want to try some still, I'm afraid I'm out of meat. I need some lump meat to whip up a few more cakes. Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river. 
Search Roland's Doom for the remaining pages of Stalvan's Journal.	Roland's Doom	This isn't all of it...You should let it go, George. The only place left to look is Roland's Doom. That's the mine south of town, and the largest lair of worgen in Duskwood. Nobody in Darkshire has ever made it back from that place alive. In fact, some of the records I have here imply that's where the monsters first came from... who knows what evil's lurking in there? Please, George, just give it up. Let's just forget about this whole thing, and never speak of it again. 
Speak to Gurrok in Deepmist Grotto.	Spelunking	Hurry, George! Make your way to that cavern at once. We shall go behind you to ensure that you are not followed. 
Assist Legionnaire Nazgrim in the defense of The Immortal Coil.	Blood and Thunder!	The time has come to make our stand, Human. We'll defend this ship to our last breath, and make these naga scum think twice before approaching it again! For the Horde! 
Bring a scale of Old Murk-Eye to Captain Grayson at the Westfall Lighthouse.	The Coastal Menace	When my life was ended upon the rocks, I had no clue what the afterlife held for me. The Lighthouse was black that night because Old Murk-Eye had scared the keeper's family off. They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again. The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly. Slay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you. 
Retrieve the Crystal Controlling Orb and then use it to deactivate the Night Elf Moon Crystal at An'owyn. Then return to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands.	Deactivate An'owyn	Their moon crystals are scrying devices -- they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can! From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan! Hurry, Mechanic! 
Bring the Hefty Sack Of Clams back to the Tranquil Wash.	Bellies Await	We have quite a stock of gathered clams to tote back to the cave, I was simply awaiting someone to do the toting. You've proven dangerous enough to be the sort. I highly expect that such a fine meal shall not pass uncontested by predators on the way back, so I'd make your trip as swift as possible. Thank you for your help, friend. It's been a pleasure. 
Report to Overseer Oilfist at Thorium Point in Searing Gorge.	Welcome to the Brotherhood	You should return to Thorium Point. Overseer Oilfist and the rest of the Thorium Brotherhood will be wondering how you fared in the fight against Calcinder. 
Report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead in Western Plaguelands.	The Menders' Stead	I don't like the looks of what the Forsaken are doing here at the Bulwark. Bombs, cauldrons, needless bloodshed... none of these embody that which the Argent Crusade stands for. Furthermore, I don't like the fact that they employ mercenaries like yourself. Nothing against you personally, Mechanic. It's just that you could be doing so much more for yourself. If you're interested in healing the plaguelands, rather than re-plaguing them, then report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead to the east. 
Bring Shaky's Payment to ""Sea Wolf"" MacKinley.	Return to MacKinley	Here, take this pouch and give it to Sea Wolf. And tell him I meant to pay him back! I swear!!I just got a little drunk and lost my way, and...you know how things are. He'll understand - you don't have to get rough! 
Report to Lindsay Ravensun at Andorhal in Western Plaguelands.	Lindsay Ravensun, Revealed	I was informed that that worthless woman, Lindsay Ravensun, would be here to support me in this battle, but so far, she's done nothing but brood within the basement of the greathall behind me. All the better, I suppose. She was a bit of a distraction. Still, I cannot and will not stand for insubordination. Find her, and bring her to me. 
Acquire 6 Water Elemental Bracers.	Water Elementals	I arrived in Stranglethorn to study a feature known as the Altar of Naias, but made the unfortunate choice of denying Colonel Kurzen's advances, which earned me several years in that cage. Now that I'm out, I figure I might as well continue with my original studies. The altar is on an island to the west, south of Zul'Kunda. Gather some of the bracers from the island's water elementals. Oh, and you can use this device when you're finished. No need to make you walk all the way back here. 
Use the Half-Burnt Torch to get to the other side of the tunnel beneath Gilneas City.	Knee-Deep	It's time to pack it in, George. Most of our people have made it through -- it's your turn now. Take this torch, you're going to need it. The tunnel is full of nasty, knee-biting critters of the worst kind. Use it to keep them at bay. Speak to Krennan on the other side. 
Katoom the Angler at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands wants you to kill 10 Saltwater Snapjaw turtles. Return to him when you have completed this task.	Snapjaws, Mon!	Don't let their big eyes fool you, mon! Those saltwater snapjaws be a menace. I can't fish for five minutes without getting a broken line from one of those oversized fish vacuums stealing my bait. Do me and the people of Revantusk Village a service and kill em, mon. Kill the whole lot of em! 
Use the GS-9x Multi-Bot to clean up 5 Toxic Geysers at the Toxic Airfield. When you get close enough to a geyser, your GS-9x Multi-Bot will automatically begin its task.	A Job for the Multi-Bot	If the multi-bot works, it will help us do all kinds of jobs that are unpleasant or dangerous for us gnomes! After Thermaplugg detonated his irradiator at the end of Operation: Gnomeregan, toxic clouds and ooze began bubbling up at the old airfield south of town. If we don't get it under control, the contamination could spread to the rest of our lands. Take the multi-bot with you, and bring it close to the geysers in the green pools at the Toxic Airfield. Your bot should spring into action! 
Speak to Adarrah in the Kelp'thar Forest.	Good Deed Left Undone	G'day, <laddie/lassie>. The name's Rendel. Seems ol' Moanah and I got here in the nick of time, eh? Erunak wasn't kiddin' when he said it was life or death! So... in our rush ta git over here, we left a little unfinished business off to the east a ways. A little lady was near death herself. We had no choice but ta leave her by a little air vent when we came here to yer rescue. How bout yeh git over and help her while there's still time? 
Obtain 3 of Nyxondra's Eggs.	Third Sample: Implanted Eggs	Nyxondra is being held against her will. She is hidden from her brood, right in the middle of their breeding grounds. She lays eggs, but they will be taken away before she can see them hatch. Cruel? Perhaps... but not nearly as cruel as the treatment that their dragonflight showed my mistress. Show me that I can trust you, George. Take Nyxondra's eggs, and bring them here. You will need to beat Nyxondra into submission before you can take them. 
Witness what occurs when you place the Merciless One on your head.	Put It On	I've got an idea for a sweet disguise, but I'm going to need your help, George! Take one of these merciless corpses and put it on your head. I know, I know, but it's dead, so what could possibly go wrong other than you smelling bad for a day or two? Ready to put it on? 
Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Hearthglen in Western Plaguelands.	An Audience with the Highlord	Oh, before you go, George... I have a message for you. There's someone in Hearthglen who'd like to meet with you. Said he's ""heard your name pop up"" a few times already. Consider yourself lucky, George. Not everybody gets a personal audience with Highlord Tirion Fordring. Oh, and feel free to use one of my mustangs for the ride up there. They're the fastest money can buy. 
Harbinger Inuuro wants you to slay 6 Burning Legion Demons and the Emissary of Hate in Dawning Square. Use the Shattered Sun Banner to impale the Emissary of Hate's corpse.	The Battle Must Go On	We must continue to defeat and demoralize the armies of the Legion. The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions. The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us. Today we will change that. Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion. When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him. 
Use the Night Elven Glaivethrower to slay 40 Orc Raiders, 8 Wolfmaw Outriders and 4 Orcish War Machines.	They Have Allies, But So Do We	The night elves made good on their promise. They've brought ships and are ready to offer us sanctuary in their lands. Unfortunately, the Forsaken's allies have arrived as well. The orcs are advancing upon us while the Horde gunship prevents the transport ships from taking our people to safety. The druids are holding the enemy back, but won't last long. Fortunately, the elven ships were carrying siege weapons. Take one of the glaive throwers and meet the enemy head on. 
Speak to the Thorium Point flight master, then use the Brotherhood Flying Machine's guns to kill Cauldron Defenders until the area is safe for entry.	Operation: Stir the Cauldron	I'm putting you on a flying machine, George. You'll be responsible for softening our landing into the slag pit. Speak with your flight master here in Thorium Point, then fly down to the gorge. Once you near your landing point, there will undoubtedly be hordes of Dark Iron dwarves waiting for you. Use our flying machine's guns to take out as many of them as you can, then land at the cavern's entrance. Rendan should be waiting for you by the time you arrive. 
Bring back 6 Unstable Mana Crystals to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square.	Unstable Mana Crystals	A group of Wretched recently raided a supply of unstable mana crystals from one of our arcane sanctums. If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls. Now, George, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad. Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates. 
Put on the Phosphora Fedora, then swim through the coral in Underlight Canyon to attract 30 Underlight Nibblers.	A Lure	Stick this device on your head, then swim through the kelp and coral along the canyon's edge. There should be all kinds of little fish in there that find your new antenna irresistible. When we return to Darkbreak Cove, we'll have armfuls of fish for everyone! 
Find and kill ""the Collector"" then return to Marshal Patterson with The Collector's Ring.	Manhunt	If the ""Collector"" is taking gold from our mines then he's stealing from the kingdom! Bring the Collector to justice, and bring me the ring mentioned in the pickup schedule you gave me. It may tell us whom the Collector is working for...That Pickup Schedule says the Collector is hiding out at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. You should search for him there. 
Journey to the Blasted Lands and speak with Enohar Thunderbrew in Nethergarde Keep.	Onward to the Blasted Lands	We appreciate your assistance here in this swamp, George. I would like to inform you that I have received correspondence from Nethergarde Keep. Enohar Thunderbrew has requested help in investigating the shipwrecks of the Red Reaches, but we have had none willing to make the journey, and I could not leave the Harborage. Nethergarde Keep sits in the Blasted Lands, south of the Swamp of Sorrows. Do not journey too close to Stonard on your way. 
Give Grent Direhammer the closure he needs by killing Mauti.	The Hunter's Revenge	The beast that's been hunting us... I've been hunting it. We call him Mauti. He's a clever one. But he made a grave mistake when he killed my brother. Now that mistake is going to cost him. Ol' Direhammer has got his scent. I've noticed him roaming just above Kurzen's Compound. If we act fast, we can take him down. Are you ready, George? 
Head to Booty Bay and find Bwemba's contact.	Making Contact	You aren't one of the zombies...A troll? I did see one, just before the outbreak... He warned us, told us to be on our guard... But it was too late. Your troll friend headed to Booty Bay to warn them... 
Use the Oil Extrusion Pump on the corpses of Seabrush Terrapins, Scourgut Remoras, and Spinescale Hammerheads in Kothrun's End to obtain 4 Terrapin Oil, 4 Remora Oil, and 4 Hammerhead Oil.	Bio-Fuel	Submarine fuel is expensive! The powers-that-be in Gnomeregan were generous enough to deliver several fuel barrels, but we're burning through it faster than expected. That means we're going to need to improvise. It's a well-known fact that sea creatures are full of all kinds of interesting chemicals... like oil. Take this device up to Kothrun's End and stick it into the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks. If we don't get more submarine fuel, their oil might be our only hope. 
Kill Yowler and recover the Blackrock Invasion Plans.	Yowler Must Die!	<The gnomecorder hums.>You need to find Yowler, George. He'll be located somewhere in the northern region of Redridge Canyons. Kill that mongrel and search his corpse for the Blackrock invasion plans. Should you succeed, bring the plans to me over at the town hall in Lakeshire. Solomon, out. 
Find the Refugee Leadership inside Fenris Keep.	No Escape	You must strike at their leaders, George. You will find them holed up in the old keep. Battle your way inside and find the holdouts! Turn them for your queen! None shall escape the mighty grasp of the Forsaken! 
Use the Horn of Summoning to call for Darkblaze. Defeat Darkblaze.	Darkblaze, Brood of the Worldbreaker	As Troteman cuts out, the world around you grows eerily silent. In the distance you see a full grown black dragon! 
Slay all of the Tentacle Horrors to free Wil'hai.	Free Wil'hai	Those tentacle horrors rising from the depths have trapped that poor beast. Please, George, can you save it by destroying those things? Will you free Wil'hai? Here, take my totem and plant it near the tentacles. The cold it emanates will cause major shrinkage on those monsters and then you'll be able to destroy them. 
Obtain a vial of Ironjaw Humour from the Ironjaw Behemoth in the Crystalvein Mine.	Too Big For His Britches	Whatever it is you want to do: I've got a recipe that'll do exactly that. You want an exploding potion? BOOM!! You want a lightning potion? ZAP!! You want a shrinking potion? Smeerp. So Bronwyn says he wants a carbon-dating potion? Easy. I could make that in my sleep. The thing is... if we want it to be accurate, I need you to get some quality ingredients. Start with some humour from a basilisk to the north. It'll need to be a pretty big basilisk... 
Slay Muddied Water Elementals to collect 5 Whirlpool Cores.	Any Portal in a Storm	Our friends in the Earthen Ring have been trying to open portals back to Stormwind, with no luck. But Thordun here tells me he might just have the key. The crazed water elementals in the nearby Verrall River Delta have been sent into a frenzy. Thordun tells me we can channel their energy into a portal. I don't understand all this elemental-claptrap, but I understand one thing: killin' elementals and takin' their whirlpool cores. Deliver them to Talaa in the courtyard! 
Collect the four heads of Za'brox and Beeble'phod.	Four Heads are Better than None	Now, while we're about to launch the attack upon the Twilight Gate, there is one last loose end to tie up: Za'brox and Beeble'phod, the disciples of Cho'gall. Intelligence has placed them within the Den of the Disciples, a small ogre cave at the southwest corner of the Twilight Gate. Please head back in and kill them. 
Get to the Hammer of Twilight.	The Hammer of Twilight	While you were in the mine, I was able to figure out where the Hammer of Twilight is being kept. They created it at the Altar of Twilight to the south. More important than that, the cultists have made a critical error: Cho'gall is personally overseeing its final construction.<Garona begins sharpening her blades.>Many Kor'kron died to bring us this information. 
Travel to Aerie Peak in The Hinterlands and speak with Gryphon Master Talonaxe.	Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Gryphon Master Talonaxe at the aviary in Aerie Peak. Our new brothers in the Alliance need your help to fend off the aggressive Horde offensive in their beloved homeland. Travel north from the Arathi Highlands, through the dwarven mountain pass and follow the road northwest to Aerie Peak. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Gather 4 Stormwind Spears, 4 Stormwind Breastplates, 4 Stormwind Shields and 4 Stormwind Helms. The equipment may also be collected from Gliblin Scavengers.	To Arms!	As we struggled not to drown, my men and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor. Erunak says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I'm inclined to believe him. If we're going to stand a chance, we'll need your help to recover our lost armaments. They should be lying on the sea floor near our shipwrecks. Hurry, Human, we're defenseless here. 
Listen to Lucien Tosselwrench's version of the story.	The Day that Deathwing Came: The Real Story	Not only was Theldurin's story wrong, it was boring, unimaginitive, and slow. I'll tell you how things really happened on that day. 
Obtain 5 Sides of Bear Meat from Shaggy Black Bears in Western Plaguelands.	A Mighty Hunger	I hail from Westfall, far to the south... as do these men that travel with me. We are farmers, and nothing more. I had been told that Lordaeron had been healed, and that it was ready for tilling. However, this ""Commander"" now tells me that it's too dangerous to proceed. He says that there's a war going on, and that the plaguelands still aren't healed. Before anything else, I need to get some food in my men's stomachs. Anything will do. Bear seems to be plentiful. 
	Gaining Even More Acceptance	 
Give Sara Timberlain the Stormwind Armor Marker.	Cloth and Leather Armor	For your shrewdness and valor, I have a marker here that is good for one piece of armor. I want you to take it to Sara Timberlain at the Eastvale Logging Camp. Give her the marker, and she will fashion the armor for you. And after you receive it, George, use it in the defense of Elwynn. Eastvale is just east of this post across the bridge. 
Kill 12 Twilight invaders within the Vermillion Redoubt.	Encroaching Twilight	Fragile Twilight invaders litter the redoubt. They're pouring in from somewhere to the west. There can be no mercy offered to them within this hallowed place. Whatever violence grips your moral heart, release it upon them. 
Recover the Gnomecorder.	We Must Prepare!	More of our citizens go missing every day. We think the gnolls are responsible, but we have no idea where they are taking them! If you are to help us defeat the gnolls and find our people, you must be properly equipped. Unfortunately, we are all out of gnomecorders. Without a gnomecorder, there is no way for us to communicate with you when you are in the field. Our last good gnomecorder was stolen by marauding murlocs last week. You will have to go to Lake Everstill, east of here, and recover it! 
Meet Thorim near the Temple of Wisdom. Report the outcome of the fight to King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem.	The Reckoning	Loken killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other. He took away everything I had, but today... that changes. Today we reclaim our sacred grounds. Today... Loken dies. Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar. I will finish this one way or the other. I need you there as a witness. You will not aid me -- this is personal. After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the Frost Giants. He's a good friend and will know what to do. 
Return the Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment to Kum'isha the Collector in Blasted Lands.	One Draenei's Junk...	A shard of glimmering rock sits before you. You sense that this item would be of value to someone within the Blasted Lands. 
Report to Quartermaster Lungertz at Nethergarde Keep.	Hero's Call: Blasted Lands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Quartermaster Lungertz at Nethergarde Keep. Nethergarde's garrison urgently needs your help to stem the Horde advance into the Blasted Lands! Travel south from the Swamp of Sorrows and follow the road east to reach Nethergarde Keep. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Speak to Captain Taylor in the Briny Cutter.	On Our Own Terms	We're as ready as we'll ever be. No sense waiting around for the naga to find us. I'll address the men, then we'll meet the enemy on our own terms and let fate decide the outcome. 
Kill Horghast Flarecrazed.	Assault on Menethil Keep	We'd barely pulled ourselves together after the flood when the Dark Iron hit the town. My men and I all rushed to defend the townsfolk, but the crazed fools retreated right into the keep itself. They're holed up good, and we can't destroy the keep. Not with half the town in ruins already. Take my place, George. I'd take the leader on myself if he hadn't dealt me this blow. Enter the keep, slay Horghast, and bring this to an end! 
Use Khadgar's crystal to neutralize anomalies in Dalaran.	Anomalous Anomalies	Dalaran's move to this location was intended to be a temporary measure, but we may need to depart sooner than expected. Blinking a city across the world is no mean feat. The magnitude of energies involved can lead to... unexpected side effects. Arcane anomalies are causing mischief throughout the city. Their presence could destabilize any attempt to blink again. We don't have time to let them dissipate on their own, George. I have a device that will help speed things along. 
Recover the Murloc Clue.	Hot On the Trail: Murlocs	As pointless as I think that this is going to be, we need to investigate all of our leads. I need you to head out to the Longshore, west of here, on the coast, and shake up some murlocs. Try to find a clue or some info that can help shed some light on the murders. Return to me if you get lucky, rookie. 
Ride The Uncrashable to the Badlands, then report to Eddie Flofizzle.	Fuselight, Ho!	Hey, Human, listen up. I got a job opportunity that you aren't gonna want to miss out on. We been sent up here from Fuselight, a new goblin town way down in the Badlands. Lots of money to be had down there, yes <sir/ma'am>. And not nearly so many zombies... or uptight Argent paladin-types. Nope, it's an untamed wilderness down there, and we're looking for someone like you to help us tame it. Whenever you're ready... we'll be waiting. 
Enter the Ivar Cottage and find a suitable hiding place upstairs. Then eavesdrop on Lord Darius Crowley.	Waiting to Exsanguinate	The Gilneas Liberation Front leader, Darius Crowley, has been meeting with another worgen inside this cottage for the past three days. I'm not sure what's going on, but we need to get inside the cottage and find a good hiding place from where we can eavesdrop. It's now or never, Human. We may never get another shot. Just promise me that if I don't make it, you'll return to Forsaken High Command and inform Belmont of whatever we discover. 
Bring Marez's head to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.	Wanted! Marez Cowl	A bounty has been placed on the head of Marez Cowl, a high-level advisor and operative of the Syndicate. She was last seen within the Syndicate controlled territory of Stromgarde. Bounty may be collected from Captain Nials. Be warned: Marez is a skilled and cunning warlock, known for her trafficking with demons. Extreme caution is advised when hunting her. 
Take The Lady's Necklace to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	The Lady's Necklace	The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself! Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it. 
Battlemage Arynna wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker when you're ready to fly over the Dead Scar. Once there, use the Arcane Charges to kill 2 Pit Overlords, 3 Eredar Sorcerers and 12 Wrath Enforcers.	The Air Strikes Must Continue	We've taken the armory from the enemy thanks to our aerial attacks against the Legion's forces in the Dead Scar. As a matter of fact, it's gone so well that we're going to continue our air strikes against them. Take these arcane charges and use them against their forces. Talk to Ayren Cloudbreaker at the Sun's Reach Harbor when you're ready for flight. 
Astromancer Darnarian in the Sun's Reach Sanctum wants you to use the Astromancer's Crystal at the Bloodcrystal, the Dawning Square portal, and the naga shrine at Greengill Coast.	Know Your Ley Lines	Freeloaders! You all want instant gratification - never giving thought to the effort required to create even the simplest of portals. Perhaps a little education will instill a bit of gratitude for my ceaseless efforts. Take this crystal. Attune it to the Bloodcrystal to the west, at the Dawning Square portal just south of here, and at the naga shrine at Greengill Coast to the southeast. Perhaps then you'll appreciate your precious translocations.... 
Escort Dumass to Safety!	Deep Mine Rescue	<You can hear Dumass speaking through the webbing.>HI! SPIDERS EVERYWHERE! THE CAPTAIN SENT ME TO SAVE THE WORLD AND CAPTURE HUMANS! WHAT IS THIS PLACE ANYWAY? IT'S SO HOT! I...<Dumass goes on and on about his situation.>Perhaps you should cut him free and get him back to safety. Or you can just leave him here, though it's your fault that he's stuck in this mine. 
Survive 2 Massive Waves of Zombies.	Ghouls Hate My Grains	You're a pro at this, George! A regular junior botanist! Listen, I've got a new seed to try called the rocknut. Use it to block the undead. Just drop it down and they'll stop dead in their tracks. Undead are so stupid! Let's give it a try! 
Travel to the Wetlands and speak to Mountaineer Rharen near Dun Algaz.	Checking on the Boys	I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands. There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands. I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them? 
Get a Wildhammer Hellions squad from Angus Stillmountain and then escort them to the drop off point in the Twilight Gate.	SI:7 Drop	Mathias Shaw and the SI:7 are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there. The Wildhammer are being kind enough to give us a lift in. The agents have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though. Speak with Angus Stillmountain and get yourself a squad to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big blue X marks the spot. 
Use the Shado-Pan Flare to aid in killing 10 Krik'thik Scentlayers.	Breach in the Defenses	Normally, it only takes a few scouts to hold this pass. Most of this territory is in sight of the wall, so archers would devastate any mantid force attempting to push through here. The problem is, most of the archers are occupied with the onslaught at the gate. Take this flare - it will help you locate the mantid that are sneaking through the eastern pass under our diminished watch. Kill any you find. We can't let them lay a trail that might lead the mantid swarms farther into the steppes. 
Kill 20 Forsaken Troopers within Andorhal.	Brother Against Brother	Our militia has been nearly wiped out. Only I and these few farmers remain. Those winged creatures... they took the bodies of our men and... and turned them into walking, undead corpses! With every one of our men they took, they bolstered their own ranks. It pains me to admit it, but you will need to fight them too, along with the deathguards and val'kyr. As they did in life, they hunt in packs, so take some of my minutemen with you. 
Hunt 10 Panthers.	Panther Stalking	The youngest panthers fell easily before you. panthers that have come of age will naturally be stronger, and quicker, and more difficult to defeat. Larger panther tracks lead to the west. 
Nazgrel wants you to travel to the road north of Hellfire Citadel and look for an assassin named Krun Spinebreaker.	The Assassin	George, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to Falcon Watch. Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush. Our scouts have informed me that an assassin known as Krun Spinebreaker waits along the road north of the Citadel. Go there and slay this assassin. Show the fel orcs we're not to be trifled with! 
Use the Blast Tape to seal 10 Faulty Valves.	Quality Construction	Look here, chief, if it weren't for this bumbly idiot across from me, the Krazzworks would be holding up just fine. Unfortunately for everyone involved, ""Fancypants"" Rothman here decided to deploy the place on top of a mountain! I mean really, who does that? So, we got leaks all over the place due to faulty valves. Think you could take this blast tape and seal 'em up for me? 
Find where Mauti has taken Grent Direhammer.	Follow That Cat	Well, that explains why Mauti seemed smaller... The real Mauti has run off with Grent Direhammer, but being the wise hunter that he is, he has fired flares off so you can track him. Find Direhammer before it's too late! 
Kill 8 Frenzied Stalkers.	Last Stand	We've got a good chokepoint here, George. Feel free to say a prayer if that's your sort of thing. Take courage and let's kill these mutts. 
Destroy 8 Azsh'ir Monitors.	Swift Approach	I've taken the liberty of performing some preliminary scouting. The naga may not be aware of our position, but they are not entirely unprepared for intruders. Beyond their patrols, they have set up magical sentry devices that will warn them of unwelcome guests. Fortunately, they seem to have sacrificed quality for quantity, and there is definitely a window in which the devices can be destroyed before their alarms are answered. I trust that you can see to this before our other soldiers arrive. 
Gather the Burning Key, the Cresting Key and the Thundering Key from the Stone of West Binding, the Stone of East Binding and the Stone of Outer Binding.	Stones of Binding	Four Stones of Binding are scattered throughout Arathi. These stones keep me pinned beneath the earth. To unlock them you must unlock the strongest: the Stone of Inner Binding. And to do that, you must gather keys from the other three. These stones are watched by guardians, but if you are clever, or lucky, you may find ways to banish them. 
Retrieve Dizzy's Eye from the Bloodsail Buccaneers.	Keep An Eye Out	Avast! Who goes there? Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye. Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place! But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again. Last night I ended up gettin' jumped by some Bloodsail Buccaneers on me way out. Took me eye, they did! Seems those blokes have found their way to Booty Bay. Help an old sea dog out by gettin' me eye back? 
Ranger Krenn'an, at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands, wants you to kill 8 Vengeful Apparitions and 8 Ravening Apparitions in the nearby lake.	Spirits of the Drowned	The lake to the north has been haunted by the ghosts of my ancestors for as long as I can remember, George. The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake. The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse. If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, George. You will have my gratitude as well as theirs... I'm sure. 
Kill 12 Twilight Stormbenders and Servias Windterror using one of the gryphons at Firebeard's Patrol.	Dropping the Hammer	Thanks to you and Iain, we've got enough riders together that we can take the fight back to the Twilight. We're trained to fight while ridin', but a second rider to handle the Stormhammer tends to be more efficient. I thought you might enjoy the honor. Pick your gryphon and join the fight. Best be quick about it though - we're aimin' to clear every last one of those Twilight off of those floatin' rocks before the hour's out. 
Use the Captured Legion Scroll near the portal at Dawning Square. Once you've gone through the portal, find Magistrix Seyla.	The Missing Magistrix	We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here. She never returned. Take this scroll we found on one of the enemy corpses. We believe it will grant you access through the portal. Once through, find Magistrix Seyla and aid her in any way you can. 
Obtain 25 Shrunken Heads from Bloodscalp trolls at the Zuuldaia Ruins.	Headhunting	We must find if Yenniku is dead. Slay the Bloodscalps of Zuuldaia and take from them their shrunken heads. You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them. And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah! Go, George. You will find the heads at the ruins of Zuuldaia, along the coast to the north. 
Seek out Fathom-Caller Azrajar midway down the northern stairs and 6 Sira'kess Tide Priestesses on the upper portion of the ruins, and instruct them to return to the temple. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Devout Assembly	Ah, Battlemaiden. You carry with you the word and the will of our Lady. I might ask a favor of you...I need Fathom-Caller Azrajar and my Tide Priestesses to return so that we can begin the ritual. Can you carry my will to them as such? You should find them spread upon the temple terrace. Azrajar will be at the stairs to the north. 
Use Duarn's Rope to save 8 Enslaved Pearl Miners.	Slave Labor	It will take me some time to break through this barrier and communicate with Nespirah. In the meantime, you can save some of those men that the naga have enslaved in the pits below.<Duarn produces a length of rope from within his robes.>This should come in handy. 
Obtain 10 Filled Furnace Flasks. You must use the Furnace Flasks on living elementals within Searing Gorge.	Heat That Just Don't Quit	We smith, we smelt, we roast up whatever spider meat we can get. Bush chicken if we're lucky. Point is, all o' this work means we need lots and lots of fire. Good thing we're smack dab in the middle of firetown. O' course, the best fire comes from the elementals. You'll find 'em all over Searing Gorge, but always near lava. Here, take these flasks and use 'em on the elementals. Oh, did I mention the elementals gotta be alive when you gather your sample? 
Scout the northwestern portion of the circular terrace and the tunnel under the main stairs to the north. Both locations are on Nar'shola Terrace, the middle level of the ruins.	Gauging Success	Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.<The admiral winces slightly as he clutches a wound on his side.>We'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did. One of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of this round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins. Up for some scouting? 
Speak with Darlene Stokx to learn the Apprentice Riding skill.	License to Ride	The captain said you'd be coming here to pick up your mount. I hope you didn't have any problems finding the place! Now, before you ride off into the sunset, you'll need to learn how to... well, how to ride! Luckily, we have a riding trainer right here! Speak with Darlene Stokx when you're ready to learn how to ride. 
Collect 5 Vials of Darkhound Blood.	Darkhound Pounding	Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society. She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring our enemies - living and dead - to ruin. My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Here, fill these vials with darkhound blood so I can test my theory. 
Rescue 5 Alliance Prisoners.	Prisoners	The Twilight cultist dropped this key. Use it to free the Alliance prisoners in the cages inside of L'ghorek. Hurry before the prisoners become sacrifices to whatever lurks below! 
Deliver a Coup de Grace on 5 Twilight Skyterrors.	Coup de Grace	Look at that. Lirastrasza's destroying them! There are still drakes that she's downing that need finishing off, George. We don't want the stinking Twilight healers to get them back up into the air. Time for a little Coup de Grace. 
Collect 10 Witherbark Tusks and 4 Witherbark Medicine Pouches from Witherbark Trolls.	Worth Its Weight in Gold	Archmage Malin sent me here to collect reagents for him. I was at a loss as to how I was going to collect the items, but now that you're here, I think my problem's solved. I need Witherbark tusks and Witherbark medicine pouches. Could you find those for me? The Witherbark live to the southeast of Arathi. 
Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	The Forsaken	I know it seems strange, but these Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, Mechanic, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately! 
Dathris Sunstriker on Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City has insisted that you travel to Azeroth at once and report to Larethor at the Sunwell.	Duty Calls	Hear me, Human. Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the Sunwell Plateau immediately. I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this:You'll be joining forces with the Aldor for this mission. Speak with a draenei by the name of Larethor when you arrive. Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces. Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious. 
Speak to Quartermaster Lungertz at Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands.	Nethergarde Needs You!	Nethergarde needs you, Mechanic! I have been sent here by Quartermaster Lungertz to head off Okrilla's nefarious lackeys and to recruit able-bodied heroes of the Alliance! Help us fight off the Horde! If you are willing, take this portal in front of me to the Blasted Lands and speak with the quartermaster. 
Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet. Use the Flaming Oil to set the ship sails on fire as you fly and once you land, slay 6 Dawnblade Reservists.	Keeping the Enemy at Bay	We've managed to capture Sun's Reach in its entirety. Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to take back the harbor. Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker. You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire. Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists. With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense. 
Speak to Gwen Armstead in Duskhaven.	Invasion	<A long knife with a skull ornament on its hilt sticks out of the militiaman's ribs. As you look around for clues, you spot a pair of savage-looking warships at the shore.><Gilneas is being invaded. Bring word back to Duskhaven's Mayor, Gwen Armstead.> 
Speak to Josiah Avery at the Military District in Gilneas City.	The Rebel Lord's Arsenal	The arsenal Crowley speaks of is in the cellar of a building just west of here. It is unnerving that artillery was smuggled inside the city by my enemies, yet it might end up saving Gilnean lives today. Find Josiah Avery and requisition the rebel artillery. We will put the weapons to good use. 
Deliver Erona's Package to Innkeeper Delaniel inside the inn at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.	Completing the Delivery	The death of another outrunner is a true tragedy, but it's a risk we all accept when we take the job. Magistrix Erona at the Sunspire needs to get this package to the inn at Falconwing Square, and she needs it there as soon as possible. We're short handed and I don't have anyone else available that can cover for us. I'm not going to lie to you; the path to Falconwing Square can be extremely dangerous if you leave the safety of Dawning Lane. Do you feel up to the task, George? 
Hold the bridge on Quel'Dormir Terrace until Lady Sira'kess' allies arrive. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Final Judgment	Get to the bridge on the east, quickly. Lady Naz'jar and the Fathom-Lord should be there with whatever forces remain. Follow our Lady's direction, as always. Hold the bridge until we can complete the ritual. Once our allies arrive, the Kvaldir will be doomed. 
Bring Furlbrow's Deed to the Jansen Stead in Westfall.	Furlbrow's Deed	This is an old deed to an expanse of farmlands within Westfall. It is signed by a Theodore Furlbrow and cosigned by his wife, Verna. And on the back of the deed are hastily scrawled words:""We leaned on Furlbrow and got his deed. Thought it might be handy if you wanted to forge one of these for your own place. The Furlbrows won't give us trouble. Last I saw them they were on their way out of Westfall, stuck with a broken wagon.""You think the Furlbrows might want their deed back... 
Wait as Rhea retrieves the egg from the Hidden Clutch.	Rheastrasza's Gift	Wait here. I will retrieve the egg. 
Find Trelane's Phylactery, Trelane's Orb, and Trelane's Ember Agate, and return them to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe.	Attack on the Tower	Here's what you're looking for: Trelane's phylactery, Trelane's orb, and Trelane's ember agate. All three should be in chests within the tower. You shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres. You'll need to have your weapons at the ready. Those ogres find out you're there and stealing from them, and they'll be sure to put the hurt on you. Be careful, and good luck. 
Speak with Kasim Sharim and participate in his ritual.	The Final Ritual	The knife is ready. Loramus is present, and he knows what he must do. I must now take the three amulets and use their enchantment to grant you access to Razelikh, the amulets' creator. I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and Loramus. Speak with me when you are both ready. 
Practice using the cannon by hitting Smilin' Timmy Sticks 5 times with cannonballs from Ol' Blasty.	Ol' Blasty	We've got some work to do. How much experience have you got with cannons? Hmm... really? Well, how about with ancient, fallin'-apart pirate cannons? We've got a few cannons updecks that work the old-fashioned way: you load one cannonball in at a time, aim, lock it into place, and fire. Works well if you're tryin' to hit the side of a three-sailer... not so well for rowboats and the like. Why don't you head upstairs and lob a few shots at Smilin' Timmy Sticks? 
Find Shakes O'Breen at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands.	Shakes O'Breen	You're all right, George. It's not every day you come across a so-called hero that has a clue what they're doing once they get this far from home, so I'll let you in on some more work. I've a friend by the name of Shakes O'Breen. He's the captain of a crew of pirates, the Blackwater Raiders; good men, respectable as pirates go. They dock at Faldir's Cove, hidden along the southern shore. I'm sure O'Breen will have lucrative jobs for you if you're interested. 
Get a Fresh Gryphon Carcass.	Bait and Throttle	You can hold your own on the ground, George. I'll give you that. But we Dragonmaw dominate the skies as well as land. Until you can prove to me you can handle a drake as well as a Dragonmaw, your Horde is nothing to me. Let's see if you can wrangle one back to Bloodgulch. First you'll need bait. Go out and kill one of the gryphons that wander the woods west or northeast of here. Make sure it's untamed! Drakes hate the stink of dwarf on their food. Get the gryphon carcass and you'll know what to do. 
Search Dun Garok for evidence of a haunting.	A Haunting in Hillsbrad	The battle over Dun Garok was the bloodiest of all the Hillsbrad battles. The dwarves, outnumbered ten-to-one, fought until the bitter end. Every last one of 'em died in defense of that piece of land. Now I hear claims that the place is haunted. Nobody wants to go near it! Unfortunately I have orders to prepare Dun Garok for habitation. Could you do me a favor and go to Dun Garok and search for evidence of a haunting? It's far to the southeast. 
Slay 5 Faceless Defilers while they are within range of the Confinement Totem.	Into the Totem	You must take my totem down into the Scalding Chasm. Use it to capture the energies of the faceless as they die. The totem will keep them from returning from whence they came. When the totem is full, bring it back to me and we will use it to lure their leader up from deep down below. 
Collect 8 Grimscale Murloc Heads. Return them to Hathvelion Sungaze in the Eversong Woods on the bluff overlooking the Tranquil Shore.	Fish Heads, Fish Heads...	Greetings, Mechanic. Take a look toward the shore; what do you see? That's right, our beach... our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the murloc. This blight will not stand! I have a task for you. If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads! Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang! 
Slay Or'Kalar and take his head.	The Real Threat	Or'Kalar leads the ogres here. He has evaded slaughter for years. His very presence is an affront to the Dark Lady; Mug'thol, traitor to the Forsaken, commands him from afar! We do not suffer ogres or traitors on Forsaken land. Bring me this ogre's head and I will make sure it's burned properly this time. 
Captain Theris Dawnhearth at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to obtain 4 Mana Remnants from Wretched Fiends and Wretched Devourers and use them to energize one of the Crystal Wards surrounding the structures in Sun's Reach.	Arm the Wards!	We've succeeded in reactivating the crystal wards around the sanctum, but why stop there? We'll build defenses around the other structures, but the Wretched are stubborn and continue to steal power from the crystal wards. Hunt them down and get the mana remnants they carry. Use the remnants to energize the sanctum wards; the safety of our operation depends on it. 
Travel to the Gullet and speak with Zaela. Kill Torth.	Fury Unbound	Narkrall's drake Torth survived the failed attack on Thundermar, and now the creature is free from his former master. Torth seeks vengeance against the Dragonmaw, and has already strafed Bloodgulch once. He will keep returning until we skewer him for good. It is time to put the Demon Chain to work. Torth's old nest is a small cave in the hills west of here that we have turned into a small camp called ""The Gullet.""Meet me at the Gullet and we will finish Torth off. 
Speak to Farseer Gadra in the Damplight Chamber.	Across the Great Divide	We will need to press deeper into Vashj'ir if we want to uncover what the naga are doing here. Go to the Lightless Reaches, the giant chasm bordering the Kelp'thar Forest to the west. If you look across it, you should see a cluster of plant-life surrounding the entrance to Damplight Chamber. Once you're inside the cave, it's a bit of a ride up until you break surface, but I have friends there that should provide you a warm welcome. 
Meet with High Overlord Saurfang at Krasus' Landing.	A Desperate Plea	George, Saurfang has not been the same since our loss at the Broken Shore. Though he led well and slew many, he has taken our defeat hard. I fear he is determined to return to the Broken Shore. Will you speak to him? 
Bring 8 Torn Murloc Fins to Guard Thomas at the east Elwynn bridge.	Bounty on Murlocs	The Stormwind Army has placed a bounty on murloc lurkers and foragers in Elwynn. Slaughter them and bring Guard Thomas their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well. The murlocs have built a village at Stone Cairn Lake north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks. 
Overload Archmage Ataeric with arcane power to bring down the Transdimensional Shield.	Transdimensional Warfare: Chapter III	<Sylvanas speaks directly through you.>You must find the being responsible for keeping this dimensional pocket active. Likely that fool, Ataeric... Search the compound for him. Should you find him, do what you must to stop him from channeling his magic. He is undoubtedly protected by a powerful arcane shield, and will send minions of arcane energy after you. Defeat the minions while they are near him to unleash their energies. No mage can handle that much power! 
Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Hearthglen in Western Plaguelands.	Turning Yourself In	So... you killed a member of the Argent Crusade, inside of Hearthglen. Usually that's not smiled upon, even in self-defense. I recommend you come back to Mardenholde Keep, and turn yourself in to Highlord Fordring. Hopefully he will hear you out, and will be sympathetic with your situation. I hope I haven't gotten you in any trouble. 
Use Betina's Flasks on living elementals within Lake Mereldar to obtain 8 Active Liquid Plague Agents.	Catalysm	Coagulated rot is potent on its own, but we need something to activate its concealed powers... a catalyst. You can find just such a catalyst to the south, in Lake Mereldar. If you look down, you'll notice that I slipped a set of flasks into your bags while you weren't looking. These flasks can be used on the water elementals in the lake. The living, corrupted water that flows through their bodies will be the perfect catalyst! 
Obtain Felix's Box, Felix's Chest and Felix's Bucket of Bolts.	A Refugee's Quandary	I was on my way to join my fellow gnomes at Gnomeregan, but then it all went so horribly wrong! I left Anvilmar, bags packed and wading through waist-deep snow. Then we had this ridiculous earthquake, and I got all turned around. I ended up here, and what's worse: the trolls stole all my stuff! George, I've obviously proven myself to be quite incompetent over the last day and a half. Would you mind infiltrating the troll camps southwest of here and returning my stuff to me? 
Return to Felora Firewreath in Silver Tide Hollow.	Back in One Piece	Yeah yeah, I'm sure Felora wants you back. That woman has no respect for innovation. When I told her about the modifications I was making for my Earth Elemental, she nearly threw a fit. Go tell her everything's all well and dandy. And tell her she's not getting a share of my inevitable fortune either. She probably likes sleeping on the rock anyway. 
Slay Gorick Guzzledraught.	WANTED: The Dark Iron Spy	A dark iron spy has infiltrated the town, stolen documents from the Explorers' League establishment, and is now in hiding somewhere nearby. He was last sighted near the top of the hill to the south of town. A sizable reward awaits anyone who can bring this spy to justice. Dead or alive - dead preferred. 
Report to Grand Executor Mortuus at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest.	Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Grand Executor Mortuus at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest. Now, more than ever, your help is needed in routing the enemy infestation of the region and conquering the port of Gilneas! To reach Forsaken High Command you must travel south through Tirisfal Glades and enter Silverpine Forest. From there, follow the road south until you reach Forsaken High Command. Destiny calls! 
With the Enthralled Val'kyr by your side, kill 5 Frightened Provincial Minutemen so that they can be turned into Forsaken Troopers. Then find Thassarian in western Andorhal.	Ace in the Hole	You have no idea how difficult it was to stay disguised while I watched Koltira let this war slip away from us. Even now, those infernal farmers threaten to overwhelm us. All because he refused to slay a friend. Take my val'kyr again, George. With her by your side, kill these farmers, convert them to Forsaken, and mobilize them. Then take a group of them into Alliance-held western Andorhal and hunt down this death knight, Thassarian. We will win this war yet. 
Obtain a Freed Red Whelpling, a Freed Green Whelpling, a Freed Blue Whelpling, and a Freed Bronze Whelpling.	Done Nothing Wrong	The Blackrock orcs of the steppes serve a dark master - one who performs twisted experiments on living creatures to create his own menagerie of abominations. Many of his test subjects are as corrupted as their master, but others are completely innocent. In the whelping downs to the south, they chain baby dragons to the ground, preparing them for such experiments. I will not stand for this. Break their fetters and return the hatchlings to me... to safety. 
Speak with General Thorg'izog.	General Thorg'izog	Kaoshin turned out to be more helpful than I expected, but we're done with him. It's time you spoke with the General. I think you're ready. General Thorg'izog is one of the ""Big Three"" that run the Blackrock forces here in Burning Steppes. He leads from the Blackrock Stronghold to the northwest. Put on your disguise and go speak with him. See if you can earn his trust. I will be in touch, should I need anything further. 
Head to Fort Livingston in Northern Stranglethorn Vale to find the Darkspear emissary.	To Fort Livingston	Da first place we check gonna be da place most likely to be attacked first. You call it Fort Livingston. Fort Livingston be surrounded by troll ruins... It make for an easy target. Maybe we find da emissary dere. Hopefully it ain't too late. 
Kill Infernus.	The Durnholde Challenge: Infernus	According to the guide, Infernus is your next challenge. This being, made of molten lava and raging fire, can be found on the lower level of Durnholde Keep, near the eastern prisons. 
Witness the concluding story of the Battlemaiden by using her broken blade somewhere in the Temple of Quel'Dormir.	Visions of the Past: Rise from the Deep	What you told me of the naga before has been plaguing my mind. Who are these allies they're summoning? Do they really think they can defeat the Tidehunter? Escaping this cave brings a degree of relief, but our purpose here remains. I'm hoping you will be willing to seek answers from the Battlemaiden one last time. There's only one place that I can think of where they would have taken the artifact - the temple atop the ruins. It's sure to be well guarded. Proceed carefully. 
Kill 12 Zin'jatar Naga at The Clutch in Kelp'thar Forest.	Come Hell or High Water	Oh fer the love of...I know our survivor friend here means well, but the lad's been severely traumatized. There only be one way ta deal with these accursed beasts, an' that be a fine dwarven axe buried hilt-deep in the noggin. Pile up enough o' their corpses an' they'll think twice before fiddlin' with yer tasty bits. Mark me words <laddie/lassie>, them buggers don't like the sight o' their own blood any more than you or I. Now git out there an' give 'em what fer! 
On the lowest level of the ruins, scout the northern end of the Quel'Dormir Gardens, the passage that leads under the ruins west of the gardens, and the structures at the southeast corner of the ruins, below the bridges.	A Better Vantage	This cave is our only refuge. There's no help on the way. Whatever happens, this cave must remain safe or we are all sure to die down here. We need a forward post to launch our attacks from. Something defensible. In the eastern portion of the ruins on the lowest level, scout the north end of the gardens, the passage leading under the main structure just west of the gardens, and the cluster of buildings at the southeast corner of the ruins, under the bridges. Bring me back any information you can. 
Kill 5 Dark Iron Spies and capture the Dark Iron Attack Plans from Captain Beld at Ironband's Compound.	Dark Iron Scheming	A cadre of Dark Iron spies have taken over Ironband's Compound to the south, beyond Helm's Bed Lake. The mountaineers are normally able to keep them from getting into Dun Morogh, but everything is in disarray right now. The Dark Iron dwarves would be fools if they didn't take advantage of the chaos. We have to find out what they're planning and stop them before they do any damage. Will you see if you can discover what they're doing down at Ironband's Compound? 
Obtain 6 Naga Icons from the Southern Savage Coast in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	If They're Just Going to Leave Them Lying Around...	I was just thinking about something, George. Those naga have more than just reeds down there. They tend to keep little statues lying around on their shrines, in the sand, under their trees. They don't seem to be USING them. I could use those statues! I could... put 'em around the camp, make it feel a little more homey. Anything's better than a bloody dinosaur corpsepump. I could sell them as souvenirs. I could sell them back to the naga! Why don't you go grab a couple while I figure this out. 
Travel to the Ruins of Aboraz in the Cape of Stranglethorn and deal with Zanzil the Outcast.	Eliminate the Outcast	You are to kill Zanzil. You rode on Hir'eek's wings and saw through Hir'eek's eyes; you know where Zanzil hides within the Ruins of Aboraz. Travel there and kill him. Oh, and Human: if we become separated, you should use this fetish. It only works within Stranglethorn, but it will transport you back here to me should you need to return swiftly. Good luck, Human. Zanzil is no ordinary opponent. 
Summon and defeat Myzrael at the Shards of Myzrael.	The Princess Unleashed	Myzrael's no innocent princess. She's a terribly dangerous force, and the giants had every reason to chain her down there. I'm afraid you've been had. According to Gerrig, you have to summon her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her. Defeat her and gather her Eldritch Shackles, then bind them to the Shards. Here's the scroll you'll need. Be careful with it; I risked a few teeth to get it. Good luck, George. 
Bring Joseph's Key to Joseph's Chest.	Hidden Treasures	Daddy told me to give you this key. He said it opens a chest out back behind the house. He also wanted me to thank you. Did you do a favor for him? Did you tell him you found my doll? Well here's the key. And thank you George. Thank you! You're a very nice <man/lady>! 
Peer into the Eye of Twilight for Low Shaman Blundy.	Eye Spy	I'll be honest, George. That thing gives me the willy-willies. But seein' as you went to all the trouble of bringin' it here, I s'pose we ought to put it to use. You first. Peer into the eye and ask it to show you inside Cho'gall's Bastion of Twilight. We'll find out what that fat two-headed bugger is up to, and use it against him. 
Kill 8 Dragonmaw Skyclaws on foot.	Last Stand at Thundermar	I'll hand it to you and your Alliance friends. You've really worked the Dragonmaw over! Many of their riders are dismounted but they're still coming at us, and my defenders will be overrun without help. Kill Dragonmaw Skyclaws on foot and Thundermar will forever be in your debt! 
Speak to Drek'Thar.	Matters of Loyalty	I have no authority over such matters. You must speak to our leader, Drek'Thar. I have already sent word of your arrival to Frostwolf Keep. Drek'Thar will be out to speak with you personally. 
Speak with Amakkar at New Kargath in the Badlands.	The Bad Dogs	In my haste to escape from Lethlor Ravine, I forgot to tie up one loose end: Nyxondra. She's free, and she's sounded the alarm among the black dragonflight. Half the flight is here in the western Badlands, combing for this egg. I'll take care of hiding the egg. You're going to take care of some of the more troublesome dragons. And you'll have help. I've paid off a couple of mercenaries to help you. You'll find them inside this inn. 
Look for Dunwald family survivors in the Dunwald Ruins.	Dunwalds Don't Die	As I understand it, you're to be looking to bring the Wildhammer clans together with the Alliance for war. Not sure you know what you're gettin' into. Anyway, if it's battle you're preparin' for, there's definitely one family you want by your side. Head southwest, to the opposite side of the Crucible of Carnage, and there you'll find Clan Dunwald's ruins. They're rightly ravaged, but that's not likely to be stoppin' the Dunwalds. It's just a matter of findin' them. 
Report the planned Bloodsail attack to Baron Revilgaz.	The Baron Must Be Told	Shiver me timbers! So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay? Why, the nerve of those scoundrels. Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders! This is bigger than I thought. Report what you have learned to Baron Revilgaz at once! You'll find him here in Booty Bay. 
Poison the Troll foodstuff at the camps in Zeb'Nowa and then return to Apothecary Venustus at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.	A Little Dash of Seasoning	I'm on loan to the Farstriders in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem. At my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food... well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining! Care to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to Zul'Aman. 
Speak with Hemet Nesingwary Jr.	Welcome to the Jungle	Welcome to Stranglethorn! Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that dwarf over there is the son of the one and only Hemet Nesingwary, renowned war hero of the Alliance and master big game hunter. Like his father, he's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, Mechanic. Go and speak with him. He's a chip off the old block, so perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers. 
Investigate Dreadwatch Outpost.	Break in Communications: Dreadwatch Outpost	I'm not gonna lie to you, George. What I'm about to ask you to do is suicide. Chance of failure is about 95%. All communication from Dreadwatch Outpost has been severed. With the worgen constantly rushing us we have no means by which to get to Dreadwatch to check on our soldiers. I need you to head south to the outpost and check on our soldiers. I'll keep in contact through the Forsaken communication device - F.C.D. - from here on out. KEEP CLEAR OF THE MAIN ROAD. 
Ride the Skystrider to Algaz Station and then speak with Mountaineer Stormpike.	The Winds of Loch Modan	Father finished the Skystrider. It's amazing! Once we get the bugs worked out, I'm going to use it to fight for justice, just like you. I know you've got to move on, and help other people, being a hero and all, but how about a ride? I'm about to take the Skystrider on its first flight, and I'll be honored if you join me. I'll drop you off at Algaz Station. What do you say? 
Defeat Calamoth Ashbeard at the Thandol Span.	The Battle of Thandol Span	I've defended the Thandol Span from being destroyed before, against the Dark Iron themselves. And so did my father, and his father before him...The only Dark Iron that managed to give me the slip ran straight for the bridge. Something's amiss, and I'm betting when we get there we'll be waltzing right into an ugly trap. I could use your help, George, for Ironforge. Are you with me? 
Use Gargal's Shield Wall and Gargal's Mighty Shout.	Gargal, the Behemoth	You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as orcs go. I make sure that my two pals here don't get into too much trouble. They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me. I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me! Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead! I can protect you, too. Come on, let's go practice for a bit. I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you. 
Kill Ardo Dirtpaw.	He Who Controls the Ettins	You've stumbled upon a gnoll document. The gnoll that wrote this propaganda is semi-literate:BROTHERS OF YOWLER, HEAR DIRTPAW! DIRTPAW GIVEN ORB FROM ORCS! DIRTPAW CONTROL ETTIN THINGS! DIRTPAW CRUSH HUMIES! COME GET DIRTPAW PAW-O-GRAPH IN RETHBAN CAVE. CAVE IS WEST, HIDDEN IN CANYON!<There's a paw print as the signature.><There also appears to be a bite taken out of the scroll.>You should probably investigate. 
Speak with Rok'tar at the Twilight Shores in Twilight Highlands.	The Southern Flank	Our new arrangement with the Horde will put my people in direct conflict with the Alliance. Bring. Them. On. As we speak, the Alliance moves up the peninsula to threaten Dragonmaw Port. Find Rok'tar to the south - I believe he has set up a command post on one of the shipwrecks - and ensure that the Twilight Shores remain in our control. 
Hunt 10 Young Panthers.	Panther Hunting	If you want to be a part of the hunt with this crack group under Hemet Jr.'s leadership, you're going to need to prove yourself an able panther hunter. You should start out easy: just focus on the young panthers for now. As you improve and gain experience as a hunter, you will undoubtedly find increasingly dangerous quarry. Start by heading east. Return to me when you are a master panther hunter. 
Accompany Kingslayer Orkus to Purgation Isle.	The Road to Purgation	The time of vengeance has come, George. Kasha can once more fly, thanks to you. She will take us to Purgation Isle so that we may confront the Stormpike dwarf general, Vanndar Stormpike, and his captain, Balinda Stonehearth. BOTH will pay for what they have done. Are you ready? Orkus cannot do this alone. 
Search Deathknell and the vicinity for 6 Scarlet Corpses, then point at them so Darnell can pick them up.	Recruitment	We've been shipping in dead bodies from Silverpine, Hillsbrad... hell, anywhere we can get them from. We can't, however, afford to ignore the bodies which are sitting right on our front doorstep. The last vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade roam here in Tirisfal Glades. While we've managed to push them from Deathknell, several of their bodies litter the buildings to the north and the east. Go find them... and bring that Darnell fellow with you. He looks strong enough to carry a few corpses. 
Collect 5 of Gnaws' teeth from the Skeletal Reef.	Shark Weak	That's one tough shark! You determine that it's in everyone's best interest to try and distract Budd and hope his attention never returns to Gnaws and this Skeletal Reef. Perhaps the teeth of the beast will prove captivating enough... 
Bring the Doublerum to Baron Revilgaz at Booty Bay.	Return to Revilgaz	Something is happening outside. Could the Bloodsail already be here? You'd better get Revilgaz his doublerum. Quickly. 
Kill Ix'lar the Underlord and 10 of his minions.	Ix'lar the Underlord	I know we're supposed to head to Northdale, but that can wait, right? Besides, this lovely little goblin was just telling me about some Scourge that are even closer by. So apparently there's this nerubian underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the Lich King was slain. He's set up a camp of undead to our north. Sure, Tyrosus wants us to kill banshees in Northdale. We'll get to that. But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close! 
Kill 8 Twilight Spearwardens.	Easy Pickings	The ambush launched smoothly. Most of the guards are dead, but a few are still pinned down with the wagons. Get in there and clear them out so we can push forward into the canyons. 
Bring the Lashtail Hatchling to Far Seer Mok'thardin at Grom'gol Base Camp.	A Lashtail Hatchling	Upon dealing the final blow to the lashtail eggs, you look down to see a newborn hatchling looking back up at you. You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements. The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you. Your original assignment was to thin out the raptors, but you have fulfilled your egg quota, and this one is an innocent newborn. Perhaps someone back at Grom'gol Base Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling. 
Blow the Horn of Tal'doren at the Woods' End Cabin and retrieve the Mysterious Artifact inside.	Take Back What's Ours	Ever since the Forsaken invaded Gilneas, we've tried to keep the location of the Scythe of Elune secret. We moved it at night to one of many safe locations. The Dark Rangers got close, but never found it... until now. They were last spotted at the Woods' End Cabin, west of here. Blow this horn when you find them and Tobias and his trackers will engage the Dark Rangers. Only then will it be safe for you to venture inside the cabin and take back the scythe. Hurry, George. It must not reach Sylvanas. 
Travel to Revantusk Village in The Hinterlands and speak with Elder Torntusk.	Revantusk Village	Not all forest trolls are foul nuisances like the Witherbark. North of here in the Hinterlands is Revantusk Village, home to the only forest troll tribe still allied with the Horde. Even they cannot escape the cruelty of their brethren. The Vilebranch tribe wars with them, distracting them from our battle with the Alliance. You have fought well here. Speak with Urda if you wish to fly to Revantusk. Their village will have use of your strength. 
Protect Huldar and the Ironband Caravan, and then inform Prospector Ironband.	Protecting the Shipment	We need to get this powder to Ironband, but this cart isn't going anywhere now. It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that Saean is with them. I'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. Miran can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart. 
Speak with Commander Althea Ebonlocke in Darkshire.	Morgan Ladimore	<He searches through the shelves and comes up with a leatherbound book.>If you would like to know more, you might ask Althea, she's been the one to handle the... trouble... with him of late. 
Recover 8 Frozen Artifacts from inside the Gol'Bolar Quarry Mine.	Priceless Treasures	Mining wasn't the only thing going on in the quarry, you know. I led a team of Explorers' League excavators recovering priceless ancient artifacts. I managed to escape, but my colleagues were much deeper in the mine and didn't survive the initial trogg attack. They took great pride in their work and they risked their lives to learn more of our history. If you're going into the mines, take this pick with you and see if you can find anything in the digs the prospectors started. 
Rescue 6 Injured Assault Volunteers.	Fallen But Not Forgotten	That was a disaster! Most of our men went down to spears before making it anywhere near the rendezvous. We're only going to be able to hold this position for so long before the naga overrun us. We need to get out there to the southwest and save as many of the men as we can find - do anything you can. They won't last long. Please hurry! 
Collect 6 Okra, 6 Stringy Fleshripper Meat and 6 Goretusk Flanks.	Westfall Stew	Hello, dear. Welcome to our home. Hmm, you don't look like you're homeless. Have you come to help us? If so, you're just in time! I'm planning dinner for the young ones and need a few simple ingredients. If you could get me some okra, goretusk flanks and stringy fleshripper meat I can make my famous Westfall stew! You'll find all of the ingredients near our farm. Just be careful of the harvest watchers. They are merciless killers. 
Destroy 8 Azsh'ir Idols on the Red Reaches.	False Idols	Neptulon the Tidehunter is our god. He was the god of the Bloodwash, too, but they have turned their back on him, it seems. They now choose to worship only Azshara, their naga queen. You will see likenesses of Azshara littered around their settlements, carved out of seastone.<The murloc spirit eyes your weapon.>That weapon will do. Send it through their Azsh'ir idols. They need to be reminded that our father Neptulon is the only one who truly rules the seas. 
Use Jearl's Hand Grenades to kill 5 Stickbone Berserkers and to destroy a Scourge Bone Animus.	The Endless Flow	Araj the Summoner is bolstering the Scourge defenses with simple skeletons... an army of weaklings that will overwhelm you before it overpowers you. He has assembled animi within Andorhal's northern towers that spew these skeletons out at an alarming rate. But I've got the solution!<Jearl passes you a handful of grenades.>Their function is simple. Throwing these grenades at a bone animus... or, for that matter, a mob of skeletons... will reduce them to splinters. 
Find the Crate of Mandrake Essence.	In Need of Ingredients	Ah, yes. The effects of the Curse cannot ever be fully cured as far as we know. With treatment, however, your mind will remain yours... and not that of a wild animal. We are fortunate that the treatment worked on you. Normally, I can only treat recent infections. We'll need to continue your medication if we're to have you reverse the Curse. I will need mandrake essence to brew another batch of my serum for you. You will find a crate stashed beneath a shed southwest of town. 
Inspect the Box of Left Over Supplies at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.	The Spoils of War	We've toppled a giant today, George. While the Blackrock orcs still swarm in their spire, I doubt their plans will take them anywhere near Redridge anytime soon. You and Keeshan saw to that. I'd say we were fairly resourceful here in Burning Steppes - those warlock supplies we collected certainly came in handy, as did the obsidian ash that we used to conceal our dragon. There were, however, some collected items left over. Please, take your pick before you move on, beyond the steppes. 
Plant a Goblin Pocket-Nuke at Sofera's Naze, Corrahn's Dagger, the Headland and Gavin's Naze.	Breaking the Hand	We must break the fingers of the Stormpike if we are to stop their incursion.<Cromush hands you a small package.>Within this package are four high-yield goblin explosives. You are to infiltrate each of the four fingers - Sofera's Naze, Corrahn's Dagger, the Headland and Gavin's Naze - and plant a goblin pocket-nuke at each. Once you have done that - as well as all that Melisara asks of you - return to me. 
Defeat Prince Valanar and his lieutenants, Vanthryn the Merciless and Luthion the Vile, then report to Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.	Breaking Through	On the lowest tier of the Temple City, there is a gray altar bathed in light. Step into it to gain entry to the dread necropolis Naxxanar. Be cautious, George. Prince Valanar will certainly be defended by his personal retainers, who will give their lives to keep you from ascending to the top level of the necropolis. You must find your way through the necropolis to the prince's seat. If you fail to defeat him, George, I fear my people will never know the safety Icemist offers. 
Take the Westfall Stew to Hope Saldean at Sentinel Hill.	Hope for the People	About four years ago, in the dead of the night, a little girl walked right into our farmhouse and collapsed on the floor. Nobody had a clue as to her identity. The poor little thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul. Soon after, we adopted the little girl and named her Hope - for that is what she represented. She is now a young lady, caring for the destitute and homeless of Westfall. Take my Westfall stew to her at Sentinel Hill, south of here. 
Blow up Render's Valley.	Detonation	Those explosives you planted were high yield, George. When I push this button on the Bravo Company field kit, that whole valley is gonna be consumed by a massive fireball of death. You know, I think you should do the honors. You did all the hard work, after all. Ready? 
Use the Elementium Axe to break the chains enslaving Lirastrasza.	Dragon, Unchained	Lirastrasza is the last and greatest of the red dragons that the Twilight's Hammer captured. They're about to kill her, Mechanic. You need to take the Elementium Axe and free her from her bonds before they do. 
Obtain 8 vials of Crypt Bile from nerubians in Terrorweb Tunnel.	Just Encased	You should have seen me fight! I must have killed six of those beasts, when...Oh wait, you can count the bodies, can't you? OK, fine. I killed four of them, when the fifth one shot me with this web. To make things even worse... when he blasted me with web juice, my mouth was open! I can't seem to break these webs, and I doubt you'll be able to, either. No, you'll have to get some of the stomach juice from those undead spider-things. That'll do the trick. 
Place the Relic Bundle at the Darrowshire town square. Prevent Davil Lightfire's death until the death of Horgus. Prevent Captain Redpath's death until Redpath the Corrupted appears. Defeat Redpath the Corrupted. Speak with the spirit of Joseph Redpath when he appears at the town square.	The Battle of Darrowshire	Now, George, you will take part in battle of Darrowshire, and you will save Joseph Redpath. Place this relic bundle in the Darrowshire town square, and the spirits of Darrowshire will rise. Join their battle and assure that these two things come to pass: Davil must survive beyond the death of Horgus, and Redpath must survive to be corrupted, then defeated. After defeating the corrupted Redpath, his spirit will be saved. Speak with him, then return to his daughter Pamela. 
Report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold in the Blasted Lands.	Blasted Lands: The Other Side of the World	Now here's an interesting one. It says that members of the Horde should talk to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold. Hmph! I didn't even know that the Horde held Dreadmaul Hold! I guess this Okrilla requires help fighting some ogres and the Alliance. You'd think she'd already have her hands full with all the demons down there! The best way to Dreadmaul Hold is to cross the Great Sea, then to take the road south from the Swamp of Sorrows. You interested? 
Speak to Warlord Krogg in Wyrms' Bend.	The Gates of Grim Batol	Kroggs started the assault to push up the canyon. He's just past the gate to our southeast. I'm going to get the squad together to join the attack. We'll meet you down there. 
Report to Surkhan at Bambala in Northern Stranglethorn.	Surkhan	Priestess is not very good at speaking Orcish, no. Maybe you go speak with Surkhan, upstairs. Tell him about what you've seen inside Zul'Gurub, yes. 
Kill Magistrate Burnside.	Burnside Must Fall	Magistrate Burnside was once the mayor of this region. In life he was a formidable adversary in the battle over Hillsbrad. In undeath he will surely test us. Burnside channels great arcane magic in the northwest section of the Sludge Fields. Lead us there and together we shall put an end to his rule, once and for all. 
Return the Explorers' League Document to Torren Squarejaw in Thelsamar.	Explorers' League Document (4 of 6)	The document bears the Explorers' League crest and seems to detail transport routes utilized by the league into and out of Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area. You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar. 
Budd wants you to collect the Pewter Pounder from King Gurboggle at Gurboggle's Ledge.	A Bone to Pick	We did it! Gnaws is down, and I have our shiney! That's good news. Darn shiney is cursed treasure - makes everyone who touches it a skeleton. That's bad news. These cursed pirates say the Gilblin King has the secret to remove the hex. That's good news. I can't step foot outside the reef or I'll be cursed forever. That's bad news. 
Speak with Gurrok and learn about his ordeal.	Debriefing	This warrior was near death, but I fear we do not have the time to await his full recovery. He has information we desperately need to know. Be patient with him, but keep him talking until we've learned all that we can. With luck we might discover just what we're up against... 
Find the prisoner in Scarlet Palisade.	A Scarlet Letter	Lieutenant Gebler:How curious that you would decide to take a prisoner... an undead one at that. What were you thinking? Do you think that, just because of the prisoner's former status, that she would be above the edicts of the Scarlet Crusade? This is most troubling, Gebler. I would remind you that there are penalties for such behavior. I command you to execute the prisoner at once. She is no longer one of us. 
Marshal Dughan wants you to speak with Guard Thomas.	Further Concerns	If you are concerned that the rumors of murlocs are true, then do this -- travel to the eastern Elwynn bridge and speak with Guard Thomas. He has been stationed at the bridge for the past week and will know the state of the area. I have here a Stormwind charger that will take you to Guard Thomas. Let me know if you wish to make use of the horse. 
Meet with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt.	Warm Welcome	I'm glad you're back! Saving the world or something, I'm sure. I was dispatched to establish relations with the red dragons in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at Wyrmrest were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems. A problem solver as it were. Care to take a crack at earning a bit of trust with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest? Anything that might soften her up a bit for me would be lovely. 
Use the Oil Extrusion Pump on the corpses of Seabrush Terrapins, Scourgut Remoras, and Spinescale Hammerheads in Seabrush to obtain 4 Terrapin Oil, 4 Remora Oil, and 4 Hammerhead Oil.	Environmental Awareness	Have you ever smelled submarine fuel, George? It's nasty stuff. Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the Verne to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife. We need to be more environmentally conscious. The sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh. Take this device up to Seabrush - just above this cave - and use it on the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks. Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures. 
Enlist the help of John J. Keeshan at the Lakeshire Inn in Lakeshire.	John J. Keeshan	You ever heard of John Keeshan, George? I was his commanding officer throughout all three great wars. Let me tell you, that man has killed more orcs than any man alive. If anyone can stop the Blackrock orc invasion, it's JOHN J. KEESHAN. We need to get him to help us or Lakeshire will be nothing more than a mound of rubble and ash after that massive Blackrock army marches through to Elwynn. I heard he was fighting in the underground fight club at the Lakeshire inn. Find him and tell him everything you know. 
Speak with Countess Verrall at Loch Verrall in the Twilight Highlands.	Spirit of the Loch	I have no knowledge of any artifact that Cho'gall is crafting, but I think I know one that can help. Countess Verrall is the ancient spirit of Loch Verrall to the north. She has no love for the Twilight's Hammer, who have polluted her waters. Seek her for the wisdom that you seek. 
Slay Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.	Distract Them for Me	There are three candidates for Ascendancy that we need to eliminate: Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose. I'd like for you to serve as my distraction. When the time is right, I'll step in and finish them off from behind. Whatever you do, George, do not underestimate them. Each got to where they are by being ruthless and very good at what they do. 
Bring Otto's Head and Falconcrest's Head to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.	Wanted! Otto and Falconcrest	The Stromgarde Militia has placed bounties on the heads of Lord Falconcrest, and his bodyguard Otto. Falconcrest heads the Syndicate's efforts in the Arathi Highlands, and his death would cause a major disruption in those efforts. His bodyguard Otto, although not a strategic target, is a fierce opponent and has killed dozens of our defenders. Their bounties may be collected from Captain Nials. 
Take Marshal McBride's Documents to Marshal Dughan at Goldshire in Elwynn Forest.	Report to Goldshire	George, you are a Mechanic with proven interest in the security of Northshire. You are now tasked with the protection of the surrounding Elwynn Forest. If you accept this duty, then I have prepared papers that must be delivered to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire. Goldshire lies along the southern road, past the border gates. 
Slay 8 Obsidian Pyrewings after using the Wyrmhunter Hooks to reach them.	Blackout	The Twilight Drakehunters used vicious implements to drag our circling drakes from the sky. Hooks that buried into their scales and held the Twilight secure while they brought our kin to the ground. We are past the point of peace. Past hope for their redemption. The only mercy we have left to offer the black flight is the oblivion that they so passionately pursue. Use these hooks to slay the Obsidian Pyrewings to the south. They should allow you much maneuverability in the air if used right. 
Find Primal Torntusk at Jintha'Alor in The Hinterlands.	The Fall of Jintha'Alor	We've got more to deal with than just dwarves, mon. While I watch the village, my mate Primal Torntusk has gone to lead our warriors against the wicked Vilebranch tribe. They've killed our brothers, and I was even taken prisoner by them once. No more! This time, the city of Jintha'Alor falls to us. Go to Jintha'Alor and speak with my mate. She's captured a camp near the entrance to the city. 
	The Journey Has Just Begun	 
Tell Khadgar to begin the ritual to summon the spirit of Alodi, the first Guardian.	Author! Author!	We've reviewed the tome recovered from Karazhan. Though we found references to the Pillars of Creation, one piece of crucial information was omitted from the book... where to find the artifacts. Fortunately, we have access to an expert on the subject. The author, Alodi, was the first Guardian of Tirisfal. His spirit is forever bound to the Forge of the Guardian, which has been hidden in our safekeeping. I think the time has come to call him forth. 
Obtain 4 Purloined Polearms from the weapon racks inside of Nespirah.	Hopelessly Gearless	I honestly don't know how we've survived this long. The naga took my armor and weapons, and left me with rags and a mining pick... and THAT snapped in half long ago. If we're to stand any hope of turning the tide, I'm going to need something to fight with... as will my companions, though they may be too proud to admit it. I've seen weapon racks in the naga storage areas nearby. I'm not accustomed to fighting with a trident, but it'll sure be better than fighting with my fists. 
Use Jurrix's Fiery Blast and Jurrix's Time Warp.	Jurrix the Striker	Oh, you want to talk? Fine. I'm Jurrix, the only merc here with half a brain. The only one with any bite to my attacks, too. The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed. Listen, you're the boss of this operation. You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart. If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks. Why don't we go try fighting together? 
Find the author of the message at Jaguero Isle in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	Message in a Bottle	Inside the bottle you find a note which reads, in fairly good handwriting:<To any that can aid me-><Please, my need for help is dire. A great beast holds me captive on an island in the South Seas.><The stars at night are foreign to me and obscured by the jungle trees, but on the clearest days I see shoreline to the northwest, and what seem to be large sailing ships to the southwest.><I beg of you, my would-be savior, please help me.> 
Destroy the hulks of three Corpsebeasts by placing three or more Argent Lightwells next to them. You cannot place Argent Lightwells while in combat, and you may not place them within ten yards of one another.	The Corpsebeasts	To the south, gutless cultists are focused on a grim task: re-animating enormous hunks of flesh, to create giants known as corpsebeasts. Luckily for us, these giants are still lifeless and weak. Take this charm - using it will place a font of holy energy on the ground. If you can manage to place three of them near one of the corpsebeasts that the cultists are reanimating, the holy energy should overload it, destroying its body forever. 
Bring 5 Mountain Horses to Lorna Crowley at the Crowley Orchard.	The Hungry Ettin	Listen, George. We're not going to make it very far without transportation, are we? If we just hightail it out of here, the forsaken will catch up to us in no time at all. Rounding up some horses from the stable grounds southeast of here would normally be a breeze, but there's one snag. That last quake must've spooked Koroth, the ettin, down from the mountains. If we don't get our horses soon, I fear that he will. 
Kill 7 Nightbane Worgen in Brightwood Grove.	Worgen in the Woods	Darkness seems drawn inexorably to Duskwood. Master Carevin's quest is the expulsion of evil and heresy. Through our efforts are the people of Darkshire kept safe. You believe yourself worthy to join us? I once thought as you. Disillusioned by the complacency of the Watch, I joined Master Carevin. If you wish to prove yourself, it will not be through words. Test your skills against the Nightbane worgen in Brightwood Grove. We'll see if you have what it takes to hunt these monsters. 
Speak to Legionnaire Nazgrim.	Rest For the Weary	You have done well, Human, but there is much more to do and I grow weary. I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to Earthen Ring leadership, pleading for their help. I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here. Speak to the leader of the men you've saved and do what you can to help them prepare for battle. The naga are scouring the waters for us. It is but a matter of time before they return - and they will surely come in even greater force. 
Deliver Captain Rugelfuss's Status Report to Mountaineer Kadrell in Thelsamar.	Onward to Thelsamar	You've helped us quite a bit here. If you're leaving, I'd ask you to take this status report up to Thelsamar. Follow the road just north, and you can't miss it. Mountaineer Kadrell will want the report. 
Swim to the surface, retrieve the flare gun, and fire a rescue flare towards the Horde Ships.	Honor and Privilege	All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Well played. Toldrek already swam up to catch it, all concerned about currents and what not. He said you'd get the honors though. Nice guy - don't know how he lasts. Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Horde ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it. Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite. 
Enter a Blam Turret, then survive four waves of trogg attacks.	Troggish Troubles	I'll need some time to analyze these samples, as well as a break from this trogg-shooting duty. Go man one of my turrets and take out as many troggs as you can. I'll be here studying. The turrets have two abilities: a regular shot, as well as an electrical overload, for when too many enemies get close! Heh, heh. Good luck. Oh, and look out for the big, slow troggs. You probably don't want to let them anywhere near you. 
Search for treasure in the bottom floor of Angor Fortress.	The Good Stuff	I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested. Those Dark Irons were here before Durdin and his crew arrived. That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the dark irons were the first ones in there, lootin' all the good stuff. I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here. You've more than proven your ability to wallop a dwarf. Head on into that fortress and wallop your way to titan treasure. I'd go with, but I'm drunk. 
Report to Humphrey Digsong at Underlight Canyon in Vashj'ir.	The Brothers Digsong	Private George, at attention! Ve are havink a small problem! Ve have sent Humphrey and Oskar Digsong out to Underlight Canyon, to the northvest, but they are not comink back. They vere supposed to scout out the area, but ve have lost all contact with them. Your assignment, Private George, is to locate our comrades and, if they live, bring them back to me! 
Report to Gek Nozzlerocket at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.	Hero's Call: Badlands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Gek Nozzlerocket at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. Your help is needed to survey the damage done by Deathwing, and the disposition of Horde forces in the Badlands. Gek has agreed to provide transportation to the Badlands via rocket, in exchange for your help. Look for him at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Recover 8 Arcane Remnants.	Ley Energies	The arcane remnant pulses with strange energy. Perhaps you should search for more remnants. Surely Dalar would be interested in such a find. 
Obtain 10 samples of Plaguehound Blood.	A Gift For Fiona	My traveling companion, Fiona, runs a small vendor's shop out of her caravan. She and I, along with our friend Gidwin, are all on our way to Light's Hope Chapel. I'm sure you can join us, if you like... though Fiona might be a little mad at me. Fiona always forgets why she's mad if you give her a gift. Kill some of the plaguehounds north of here, then bring their blood to Fiona at the caravan, down by the river. She'll love it. We'll talk again there. 
Find Pamela Redpath in Darrowshire.	Little Pamela	The battle for Darrowshire still haunts me, Human. I wake up in cold sweats, convinced that I'm still there; that it is happening all over again. I've coped with the loss of my comrades, but the loss of my family members is still cripplingly painful. One of my kin lost during the attack was my young niece, Pamela. If you are brave enough to enter Darrowshire, will you search for any sign of Pammy? Darrowshire's ruins are due south of here. 
Attune yourself to the Bloodstone Teleporters in the Serpent's Coil.	Attune the Bloodstone	Did you have fun fighting your way to the back of this cave? I admit, I haven't picked the most... convenient of spots to perform my studies, especially for passing adventurers who wish to enter and leave at will. However, I can allow you to attune yourself to my bloodstone teleporters. Simply place your hands on the stone in the back corner, and you will be teleported outside of the cave. Then use the stone outside to teleport back! 
Locate an Eye of Twilight within the Black Breach.	A Vision of Twilight	Cho'gall keeps track of his minions through these funny magical balls: ""The Eyes of Twilight.""If I could get me hands on one of those, I bet we could use it to look in on Cho'gall and see what his creeps are up to. Get me one! Search the Black Breach, east of here and just north of the river. Find me an Eye of Twilight, and do whatever you gotta do to bring it back here. 
Report to John J. Keeshan at Flamestar Post in the Burning Steppes.	Hero's Call: Burning Steppes!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to John J. Keeshan at Flamestar Post. Your aid is urgently needed to put an end to the Blackrock orc menace! You can reach the Burning Steppes by traveling south from the Searing Gorge through Blackrock Mountain. Look for Flamestar Post on the far side of the mountain. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Speak to Divemaster Birmingham in Glimmerdeep Gorge.	A Powerful Need To Eat	Poor things. They're starving. We've many matters to attend to, not the least of them the naga, but first we need to get some food in these bellies. I'm not sure what the naga fed them up in that shell, if anything, but they're definitely worse for the wear. Quite a few of the survivors have made their way into Glimmerdeep Gorge, to the northwest. Go join them and help out. With a bit of clam meat, we can get these survivors back on their feet. 
Use the Attack Signal from atop one of the towers at the Twilight Gate.	Signal the Attack	Now that you've lured Skullcrusher the Mountain away from the Twilight Gate, I need you to signal our forces to attack! 
Put on the Fish Hat, then swim through the coral in Underlight Canyon to attract 30 Underlight Nibblers.	Here Fishie Fishie	<Orako rolls the glow-juice into a ball, then attaches it to a device that he's clearly been working on for a long time.>Here, I got you this hat. It has a light on it, and it will make fish follow you. Just like the murlocs! The murlocs like to hunt in the kelp and coral along the sides of the canyon. If you put on this hat and swim in that kelp, you might catch some fish like they do. 
Destroy 5 Ancient Conduits.	Ascend No More!	TO STOP... THEIR... RITUALS OF ASCENSION... YOU MUST DESTROY... THE ANCIENT CONDUITS. THEY USE... THE CONDUITS TO... SIPHON... MY ENERGIES AWAY... AND MAKE... ASCENDANTS. A FIGHT WITH... NEPTULON IS IMMINENT. THE TWILIGHT'S HAMMER... MUST BE DENIED... THESE CREATURES. 
Collect 5 Crunchy Spider Legs and return them to Master Chef Mouldier at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	Culinary Crunch	This is intolerable! I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station. No? But I get here and there is no food. You must go out, Mechanic, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare. Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food. There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar. Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with. 
Destroy 6 Opengut Behemoths in Andorhal.	War Machines	Dried-up Scourge... weak. Abominations... strong. We defeat strong abominations... we win war. 
Slay Ner'gosh the Shadow.	Shadow Boxing	Ner'gosh the Shadow is the leader of those warlocks to our north. He's the jerk that kicked me out of my home once those Blackrock orcs started showing up. Well, they're all jerks, but he's the jerkiest. If I'm ever going to move back in near the Altar, Ner'gosh has to go. 
Assess the situation at the Sludge Fields.	No One Here Gets Out Alive	This farm is under lockdown! Nothing gets in and nothing gets out! We're still assessing the situation to try and figure out exactly what happened, but my theory is that the laborers ate the mushrooms and somehow mutated into hideous undead monsters. I mean, how else could this have happened? This is just a farm! We grow mushrooms here! And sludge! Yes, sludge! Take a look around, Mechanic, because now that you're here you can't leave until this issue is resolved. See for yourself! 
Gather 7 Ghoul Ribs from Fetid Corpses at Manor Mistmantle.	Ghoulish Effigy	Out here on the outskirts of town, it's a wonder the walking dead haven't eaten me! In fact, just yesterday a pack of ghouls was pounding on the walls of my tower! I want to make an effigy - a kind of ""scarecrow"" for ghouls. To do that I need some ghoul ribs. You can find plenty of them on the fetid corpses wandering Manor Mistmantle's grounds, north of Darkshire...Get the ribs for me, and I will repay you with some coin. 
Apply the Anemone Chemical Application Device to 8 Clam Divers.	Odor Coater	Marvelous creation if I do say so myself. Ready for deployment. Simply spray the clam divers with a bit of the chemical and they shall soon be accompanied by a protective aquatic companion. You can even spray yourself to similar effect if you so desire. Speaking of desire, I would highly recommend that you moderate deployment of the chemical attractor to minimal applications. Large doses could result in undesirable effects...Undesirable for you anyway. Likely very desirable for the fish. Away! 
Mount a gryphon to join the attack on Iso'rath.	The Maw of Iso'rath	We are ready to attack the beast. First, we need to destroy it's tentacles, then Yevaa will perform a ritual to summon a powerful fire elemental that we will drop into its maw. I want you to fly out with our first group attack. Hold steady until an opportunity presents itself, then join the battle with the rest of the shaman in cutting the tentacles down. Take any one of the gryphons when you're ready to join the assault. 
Slay 15 Desiccated Scourge within Andorhal.	Scourge First... Alliance Later	Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal. My old counterpart, Thassarian, leads the Alliance forces. If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once. I know Thassarian well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first. We will do the same. Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers. The Alliance will have to wait to taste our wrath. 
Destroy High Priestess Jeklik's body before Zanzil can resurrect her. If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with Maywiki at the Explorers' League Digsite.	High Priestess Jeklik	Ahead of you looms a ramp up to one of the city's many terraces. The bat-shaped totems ahead of you indicate that this is the domain of High Priestess Jeklik, a follower of Hir'eek. Jeklik was one of the Hakkar-worshipping priests that Zanzil was planning to resurrect. Perhaps if you hurry, you can stop the resurrection! 
Kill 10 Redpine Looters.	Taelan Fordring's Legacy	Greetings. How do you do? My name is Daria. I am one of the priests in charge of preserving the peace here in Hearthglen. One of my duties involves maintaining the tower down the trail to the southeast of Hearthglen. This particular tower is of personal importance to the Highlord. It's the place where his son was killed. With the recent incursion of gnolls, however, maintenance of the tower has grown difficult. Will you help me rid the trail of some of these gnoll vandals, so I can do my duty? 
Speak with Kasim Sharim to begin the blood ritual.	Blood Ritual	I suppose you want to know what we're doing. Here's the short version - a version at which I happen to be an expert:The Shadowsworn cultists wish to summon the demon, Razelikh, back to the Blasted Lands. We cannot allow this to happen. So we're going to summon him ourselves, and then kill him. A task not as simple as it sounds...Let me know when you are ready to begin the blood ritual, and then stand back. 
Pass Vex'tul's test of strength.	Honor and Strength	My name is Vex'tul, and I have watched you fight, Human. You are strong. You killed my master, Zaeldarr, but this does not bother me. I value strength over any loyalty that I held for him. I value strength over anything else. Prove to me one final time your strength, Human. Do so, and I will lend you MY strength for whatever purpose you may desire. 
Slay 8 Zin'jatar Raiders.	Buy Us Some Time	So many good men have been lost today. Without you, that number would be even higher. You have our gratitude. If what the shaman says is true, then there is no time to spare. The naga are scouring these waters looking for survivors. We are not yet ready to fight. You must buy us time to make preparations. Find the naga that hunt us and delay their efforts. 
Kill 12 Stonesplinter Troggs or Stonesplinter Scouts.	In Defense of the King's Lands	We need to protect the Loch, George! With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front. Troggs are tunneling up from every crevice! The trogg infestation poses the largest threat to Ironforge. We need you, brave adventurer, to venture forth and lay waste to the trogg threat. Slay twelve Stonesplinter troggs and venture back. 
Collect 12 Gnoll Ears from Mosshide Scouts or Mosshide Bashers.	Out of Gnoll-where	Well met, Mechanic. We've got a problem, and I'd ask you to lend a hand. It's gnolls. There's a mess of the things west of town, roaming the hills. Not usually any cause for alarm, but we've not usually had gnolls here in Loch Modan. I'm curious where they came from, but not curious enough to bother asking the mangy things. Clear 'em out, I say. Bring back proof of your kills and I'll pay a solid bounty. 
Defeat the traitor in the Duskroot Fen.	Corruption Runs Deep	Today you learn that no one can be trusted in times of war, Wakener. Even those closest to the Klaxxi are susceptible to corruption. Who knows how long this traitor has been corrupted. He must be destroyed! You appear confused. Do you not see the traitor in our midst? Allow me to adjust your vision. 
Bring back 10 Rotting Hearts to Magistrix Aminel in Tranquillien.	Rotting Hearts	I hear the Amani trolls eat their enemies' hearts to steal their strength. They might just be on to something, George. With the proper treatment, the hearts of the unliving can produce potent elixirs. Hunt down the zombies that roam the Dead Scar and bring me their hearts. I'll show you the kind of enhancement we can perform to your physical prowess against the undead. 
Lure in a Baited Black Drake, attack it until it is weak, and then ride it back to Bloodgulch.	How to Maim Your Dragon	<You sling the gore-spattered gryphon corpse over your shoulder, its wings dragging to the ground.><Highland Black Drakes roost just southwest of the Crucible of Carnage, along a ring of low mountain peaks.><If you drop the gryphon corpse there, a drake is sure to start feeding. With its guard down, you should be able to attack it until it is weak enough to mount and fly.> 
Kill Varkul the Unrelenting. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Not Soon Forgotten	The Kvaldir leader has shown his rotting, ugly face but a short swim from here, down this hall to our west. We kill him now and the Kvaldir occupation of our once beloved city shall be ended. Beware Battlemaiden, for he is no weakling. He has many Kvaldir at his command. Some Sira'kess Sea Witches have been dispatched to weaken him during your attack, but they will be interrupted if you let any of his Kvaldir attack them. Show no mercy, Battlemaiden. 
Bring Ol' Sooty's head to Vyrin Swiftwind at the Farstrider Lodge.	Vyrin's Revenge	Light! Don't bring things like that into the Lodge... it's unsanitary, unspeakable, un... un... unsanitary! Just get it out of here, will you? No one wants to see your bloody little trophy, really! 
Use Amakkar's Kidney Shot and Amakkar's Pocket Potion.	Amakkar, Jack of All Trades	Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killing, let me tell you a little bit about how I fight. I'm not terribly strong or stalwart like these other two, but I've got a few tricks. At your command I'll stun your enemies to keep 'em held still. I also make sure to keep a few potions around for tight spots. Why don't we practice fighting together? Head out into the field, and you can see what it's like to fight with a real orc. 
Find the Ambermill Codex.	Breaking the Barrier	While Godfrey and I make preparations for our assault upon Gilneas, I want you to lead our attack upon Ambermill, directly east of here. The former Dalaran magi of Ambermill have erected a magical barrier that somehow cloaks them from vision. They currently reside within some type of pocket dimension, awaiting orders from the Alliance to begin their attack. We must prevent their assault by making a pre-emptive strike. Venture to Ambermill and find information that would grant us access to the mages. 
Report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold in the Blasted Lands.	Warchief's Command: Blasted Lands!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold. Okrilla, commander of the Horde forces at Dreadmaul Hold, requires your help to secure the outpost against rebellious ogres and the forces of the Alliance. Travel to Dreadmaul Hold by taking the road south from the Swamp of Sorrows. Destiny calls! 
Find a worgen woman at the Thondroril River in Eastern Plaguelands.	Visitors	My sources at the Menders' Stead have informed me that we will be having some visitors soon. A group of paladins - led by a worgen tradeswoman, of all things - will be arriving here shortly. I look forward to meeting them. Particularly one of them. Would you mind stopping in and checking in on them? I can't say for sure, but by the time you get there, they should just be crossing the Thondroril River, far to the west. 
Free 5 Enslaved Villagers inside the Emberstone Mine.	Liberation Day	We recently found out that the villagers at Emberstone survived most of the ravages of the Curse. Unfortunately their village wasn't as fortunate when it came to the Forsaken invasion. The Forsaken have taken the villagers prisoner and are forcing them to work the nearby mine as slaves. 
Collect the Bundle of Shredded Letters from Brightwood Grove.	The Stolen Letters	You want to know about Stalvan...You're not the first, you know. We get outsiders coming through asking about him every so often. Always outsiders. Everyone who lives here knows better. You're out of luck, anyway. I'm missing half the archives. Feral worgen broke into the town hall not a few nights ago and tore the place to shreds. The documents you'll want are probably strewn all across Brightwood Grove by now, deep in the woods to the west. Not worth it if you ask me. 
Speak with Outrunner Alarion near the bridge leading south of Sunstrider Isle.	Aiding the Outrunners	Magistrix Erona wanted you to head over to Silvermoon City in order to aid our reclamation efforts there... that is, once you had successfully addressed the situation at Falthrien Academy. You did not disappoint us, George. On your way to Falconwing Square, south of here, you should speak with Outrunner Alarion. She's not far from the bridge. The Outrunners take care of shuttling goods between here and the mainland, and since you've proven to be so resourceful, they could use your assistance. 
Reactivate 6 Nar'shola Wards on the middle level of the ruins: Narshola Terrace. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Built to Last	My lady, I have a request from the High Priestess that I am to pass along to you. Many of the city's defenses remain from long before it sunk beneath the waves, and some of them are but a trivial task to reactivate, were it not for the countless Kvaldir that stand in our way. We are told you are to be fighting on Nar'shola Terrace above us. You would do my lady a great service if you would but touch some of the devices as you pass. Your noble blood should prove more than sufficient to reactivate them. 
Return to the western edge of the Biel'aran Ridge with news of the Crucible of Nazsharin. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Chosen Burden	With the Crucible of Nazsharin, all that remains is to inform Lady Naz'jar of your success. 
Find Dark Ranger Velonara in Tirisfal Glades.	The Dark Ranger's Pupil	Thank the abyss you're here, fellow hunter! I'm concerned about Dark Ranger Velonara, who frequents the Trueshot Lodge. Velonara is a good friend, and I fear she is in peril. She's been training an apprentice dark ranger, a lad named Prelus. Newly raised, she said. At any rate, Prelus ran off after receiving a letter from his brother, and now Velonara has gone to Tirisfal Glades to find him. I have a bad feeling about all this. Would you be willing to check on her safety? 
Detonate the Hidden Explosives to lure Skullcrusher the Mountain away from the Twilight Gate.	Move the Mountain	If the Twilight Gate is to fall, we must get Skullcrusher the Mountain out of there! Before they left, I saw to it that your Kor'kron assassins took some explosives hidden in a Twilight's Hammer crate. By now, they will have planted them on the steps leading up to the upper portion of the Citadel. I want you to set the explosives off and then signal us when that monster's out of the way. That's when we'll attack and finish off the ogre compound! 
Speak with Executor Zygand at Brill in Tirisfal Glades.	Take to the Skies	If you're headed back to Brill, you'll want to stop by Executor Zygand on your way out. I hear there's some excitement going on in Silverpine Forest, to the south. He'll know more than I do. Speak with me again when you're ready to head out. 
Go to the Lakeshire Graveyard to tune the Gnomecorder.	Tuning the Gnomecorder	The gnomecorder looks to be in working order. I've got you all hooked up, now we just need to tune the gnomecorder for reception. Head north out of Lakeshire and follow the road up to the graveyard. Once you reach the graveyard I'll attempt to transmit. 
Bring Sassy's Largesse to Chabal in Hardwrench Hideaway.	Chabal	Chabal, that troll over by the botanical gardens/biological weapons lab, is a special guest. He's a representative of the Zandalari trolls, and has traveled quite far to stay with us.<Sassy places some of the items you've collected in a small parcel and hands it to you.>Here, give this to him. Tell him that the Zandalari are always welcome at Hardwrench Hideaway! And mention that referrals are key to maintaining our business! 
Speak with Fiona at Eastwall Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.	Argent Call: Northdale	Tyrosus has given us our next task: slaying more undead in Northdale. Gidwin is excited to move forward, but I think we should show a little more caution. Let's meet up with Fiona. She should be at the next tower by now... Eastwall Tower, I think it's called. It's close by, to the northwest of Light's Hope. We can rest there, and plan our attack on Northdale. 
Obtain 4 Supple Tiger Furs and 4 Velvety Panther Furs.	Plush Pelts	Hi, I'm the town merchant! And Bronwyn's my dad! Sorry, I shouldn't get too excited. Father says it's not professional. Anyhow, people always come to me asking for heavy leather, or rough hides, but I think they might also like it if I had some soft materials... like tiger fur! Think you could get some for me? You'll find a few panthers nearby, but if you want to see the big tigers, you'll have to go northwest from here... north of that big troll arena. 
Use the Captured Riding Bat to destroy 6 Forsaken Catapults and 40 Invading Forsaken.	Slowing the Inevitable	As much as I want to exact swift and brutal revenge... I must honor my son's memory first. He cared for his people first and foremost. The Undertaker's Pass goes underground below Northgate River. You must prevent the plague from being deployed while we evacuate our men, women and children to Aderic's Repose. We captured one of the Forsaken's dreaded bombing bats. I want you to fly the infernal beast as best you can and unleash hell upon those who seek to bring the Plague to our people. Hurry! 
Obtain a Cask of Stormhammer Stout, a Cask of Theramore Pale Ale, and a Cask of Gnomenbrau.	First Things First: We're Gonna Need Some Beer	I don't know how ANYONE expects to get any work done around here if we don't have any ale! Our beer level here in Anvilmar is dangerously low. Lucky for us, we've stowed some backup kegs for just such an occasion. West of Anvilmar, along the valley's northern border, ye'll find kegs of Stormhammer Stout and Theramore Pale Ale. Just to the east of here, ye'll find a stash of Gnomenbrau. That's me personal favorite. 
Prince Liam Greymane wants you to slay 6 Rampaging Worgen.	All Hell Breaks Loose	Worgen! My father had warned me that Archmage Arugal's creations had run amok. But where are they coming from? I suppose it doesn't matter. Help us make quick work of them. We'll show them what we Gilneans are made of! 
Kill 16 Kvaldir on Nar'shola Terrace, the middle level of the ruins. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	To the Fathom-Lord's Call	Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar has sent word that the Kvaldir leader has shown himself. I would like you to make your way to him at the far end of the terrace above us, on the middle level of the ruins: Nar'shola Terrace. Kill any Kvaldir that stand in your path on that terrace. We want the echoes of this defeat to ring in their minds so that they will dare not return to threaten our purpose here. Your devotion does not go unnoticed, my battlemaiden. Go knowing that you have my blessing. 
Bring Dolph's Package to Rhea at Lethlor Ravine in the Badlands.	A Strange Request	On to other matters. I have a package that I need delivered. A young lady came by our town not long ago, looking for compressed blasting powder, a tempered mithril bomb casing, and some safety goggles. Naturally, we had plenty of blasting powder and bomb casings to sell her, but the safety goggles were a little harder to find. Long story short, I've got the goggles, but she's already returned to her studies down in Lethlor Ravine. Will you bring these down to her? 
Plant the Wards at the Eastern, Southern and Northern locations around the tower in Deadwind Pass.	Reclaiming the Ramparts	With the ley lines protected we must move to secure the tower's perimeter. Around the tower are several locations where corruption continues to run rampant. Seek out these locations and secure them with these wards. With the progress we've made so far, bolstering our defenses should keep the remaining Legion's forces at bay just long enough for us to discover who's behind their efforts. 
Report to Commander Thorak at Bladefist Bay in Durotar.	To the Depths	The Earthen Ring has identified the watery realm of Vashj'ir as a source of the adversary's destructive energies. It is still uncertain what dangers might be faced there. Any information you could gather would be of great value. The Horde is sending warships to the region as we speak. To gain passage, speak to Commander Thorak at Bladefist Bay. May the spirits guide you, George. 
Check in with Fiona at Eastwall Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.	An Opportune Alliance	With your contributions to the food stores, my current assignment is complete. I will be heading north, to the Plaguewood, next. I understand you may be headed in the same direction. Do you mind if I join you on the road? I will head northwest, to Eastwall Tower. If you're interested in teaming up, you can meet up with me there. 
Use the Gift of Naias to summon Naias, then obtain the Heart of Naias.	The Altar of Naias	The salt you brought was sufficient to activate the bracers' innate enchantments. I have taken these enchantments and combined them into a summoning token... a gift, if you will. Return to the Isle of Naias, and place the gift on Naias' altar. Call me again once you have Naias' heart. 
	Give Gerard a Drink	 
Blow the Heth'Jatari Conch next to a Heth'Jatari Banner. Kill Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar. Luring him into incoming mortar fire will help.	Blast Him!	Let's go fishing, George! Now that the mortars are ready, we can take out the leader of this invasion. Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar rules over the Blackscale warrior caste. Go to the Heth'Jatari Banners just northeast of here and honk this conch shell. It's like a dog-whistle. For fish. When Heth'Jartar shows up, I'll order the mortars to concentrate fire. You'll see the targets of the incoming shells. Lure Heth'Jatar into our mortar fire and pummel him into submission! 
Obtain 7 of Sassy's Secret Ingredient from Thrashtail and Ironjaw Basilisks in the Crystalvein Mine.	There's Somebody Out There Who Wants It	So, while you're already all sweaty from doing all that other stuff, I was thinking I might grab you for one more task. You don't mind, do you? The latest Science and Explosions journal just came in from Bilgewater Harbor, and there's this article about this hot new reagent. Prices on the reagent are skyrocketing, and we're in prime position to capitalize!<Sassy leans over and whispers the details into your ear.>You got that? Good. You can find the basilisks in a cave, far to the east. 
Recover the Key of Ilgalar.	The Dark Tower	We got lucky with some vital intelligence from the locals of this valley. Those two behind us, the Ranthals, have informed me that the gnolls in Galardell Valley are being controlled by a powerful magus in the tower of Ilgalar. The problem is that the tower is sealed by a magical force field. The first thing we need to do is get the key that will get you inside. The gnoll general, Fangore, has your ticket inside. Kill General Fangore and get the key. I'll be in touch. 
Kill an Okril'lon Scout outside of Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands.	Minor Distractions	Nethergarde has stood steadfast for years against the demon onslaught that plagues this land. Our watch is never-ending, our vigilance unfaltering, and our courage bottomless. We have held these lands since the portal opened, but now these Horde insects have the insolence to stand in our way!? We have protected THEM as well as we have protected ourselves!<Lungertz looks you over.>Let's see if you've got a hand for combat. Slay one of the Horde's Okril'lon scouts that nibble at our perimeter. 
Destroy the Twilight Rune of Earth, Rune of Water, Rune of Air, and Rune of Fire.	Rune Ruination	Examining the Twilight Rune of Earth, you can almost feel its power extending further into the Elementium Depths. It's probably connected to other runes. Initiate Goldmine thinks that you should destroy all of them. 
Kill Marl Wormthorn at Maldraz in the Blasted Lands. You can use the Demoniac Vessel to pull him out of his trance.	The Downfall of Marl Wormthorn	When word gets out about what we've done... there's no saying what the citizens of Surwich will do. They cling so closely to Wormthorn's dream......but still, it must be done. Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance. Return to me when he is no more. 
Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests.	Making Ready	Supplies are inbound, or so I'm told. Regardless, we can ill afford to wait around hoping that help arrives before our offensive stalls. We must make the best of what we have. As for me, I need ore to fashion an anvil so I can begin to upgrade our armor and weapons. There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one.... 
Search for Gidwin Goldbraids within the slaughterhouse in central Plaguewood.	Gidwin's Fate Revealed	Quickly - find an entrance to the slaughterhouse to our south. I will meet you on the inside. Be ready for a fight! 
Use the Blackrock Cudgel of Discipline on 20 troops in the Fields of Honor. If one of the troops discovers your disguise, cudgel him to death before he can unmask you.	I Am the Law and I Am the Lash	I've been looking for a good, strong soldier like you. I need someone to keep my troops in line. Outside the stronghold, you will find orcs, ogres, and trolls preparing for the assault on Redridge. My sergeants keep them in line, but I'd like you to assist them. Take this cudgel and discipline a few of my soldiers. I don't care if they're misbehaving or standing perfectly in line, I want them beaten. I want them focused, battle-hardened, and obedient. Now go. 
Talk to Russell Brower and help him write a song.	Words and Music By...	I've written many an epic tune in my lifetime, George, but this upcoming wedding deserves a very special ballad. And fast! Should I write a love song? A lighthearted ditty? A bawdy drinking song? I could use some help with the lyrics, if you fancy a go at it. Talk to me and we'll write a song together! 
Report to Elder Torntusk at Revantusk Village in the Hinterlands.	Warchief's Command: The Hinterlands!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Elder Torntusk at Revantusk Village. Now that the Wildhammer dwarves have officially thrown in their lot with the Alliance, they have made themselves our enemies. They must be defeated! To reach Revanktusk Village, cross into the Hinterlands from the mountain pass in eastern Hillsbrad Foothills and make your way to the eastern coast. Destiny calls! 
Find the Horde survivors inside of Nespirah in Vashj'ir.	We Are Not Alone	<Duarn closes his eyes, pauses, and nods.>Nespirah has just informed me that we are not the only people fighting inside of this shell. A small group of Horde slaves has escaped and is currently fighting off the naga on the other side of the shell, up on the ledge that overlooks Nespirah's heart. Go find them, George, and see what help they can lend us. With their aid, we may be able to rouse Nespirah from her torpor. I will remain here, should you need anything. 
Speak with Shilah Slabchisel at Swiftgear Station, north of Menethil Harbor.	Swiftgear Station	You've done good work here, George. Askin' you to haul sandbags would be a waste, to be honest; I'd rather send you along where your skills are needed. We've got a small outpost up north in the marsh. Swiftgear's the gnome that built it, but you'll want to talk to Shilah Slabchisel and help her with Ironforge matters. I'll admit, she's a looker... but I wouldn't make the mistake of getting fresh with her! They don't call their family Slabchisel for nothing. 
Get a Crushblow Wind Rider squad from Jon-Jon Jellyneck and then escort them to the drop off point in the Twilight Gate.	Kor'kron Drop	Garona and a detachment of the Kor'kron are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there. I've called upon a local tribe of trolls to give us a lift in with their wind riders. The assassins have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though. Speak with the troll chief, Jon-Jon Jellyneck and get yourself a detachment of Kor'kron to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big red X marks the spot. 
Report to Lieutenant Horatio Laine at the Jansen Stead in Westfall.	Hero's Call: Westfall!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Lieutenant Horatio Laine at the Jansen Stead. Westfall has been overrun by beggars and transients, leading to a massive increase in criminal activity. Your help is needed to restore order to the populace. You can reach the Jansen Stead in Westfall by traveling west from Elwynn Forest. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Deactivate the 3 Duskwither Spire Power Sources inside Duskwither Spire. Then return the Deactivating Jewel to Apprentice Loralthalis in Eversong Woods.	Deactivating the Spire	As you may know, Magister Duskwither sent me back here to shut down the power sources that feed the Spire. There are three of them, each located in a different place inside. Unfortunately, I appear to be too late, and Duskwither Spire has been overrun with strange, magical creatures. While I haven't the expertise to accomplish this task, surely a Mechanic, such as yourself, could do so easily? 
Search Alther's Mill for a member of the Bravo Company.	In Search of Bravo Company	If you and Keeshan are going to defend Lakeshire, we're going to need to find his old battalion. Last I heard all of 'em - Messner, Jorgensen, Krakauer and Danforth - were captured by the Blackrock orcs. Now I don't know where they could possibly be or if they're even alive, but I'd be a damned fool if I didn't ask you to try and find 'em. Search Alther's Mill, east of here, for any clues. 
Kill Dragonmaw Marauders and collect 8 Dragonmaw Insignias. Named characters within the Thundermar Ruins will also carry insignias.	Dragonmaw Takedown	The Dragonmaw!<Colin spits.>Monsters, all of them. We've fought them up and down these highlands since the last war. And now they're joining forces with the Horde? If you're going to convince us Wildhammers to unite under the Alliance banner, you'd best prove yourself against the Dragonmaw. Wade into the battle that's raging in the Thundermar ruins to the south and southwest. Kill Dragonmaw marauders and collect the insignias that their greatest warriors wear. Then we'll talk. 
Slay Anok'suten and return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	Anok'suten	Come closer, I am ... dying. I was sent here ... to slay these nerubians, but Vandril didn't ... know that they have a leader.<The dying blood elf coughs up a good amount of blood.>You must find and ... slay Anok'suten. Get help. She wanders around ... Suncrown Village. 
Acquire a Black Diamond Heart.	Paint it Black	The ground bleeds, Mechanic. They tear it open, as one would gouge flesh. These cultists relish their secrecy but the very elementals they use for their misdeeds can betray them. Seek out Obsidian Stoneslaves northeast of here, among the ruined earth we have named the Black Breach. Shatter their bodies and find for me a perfect heart of black diamond. I will look into this heart. And I will bare its soul. 
Speak with Lord Itharius atop the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.	Blessing of the Green Dragonflight	You have done well, George. Jammal'an may have escaped our grasp, but his retreat paves the way for me to enter the temple as I desire. Stay where you are and do not move. I will hasten your return by pulling your spirit to me through the Emerald Dream. This may cause slight drowsiness. 
Follow Tobias Mistmantle in the Hunt for Sylvanas. If you lose Tobias, return to Lorna Crowley and speak with her to call again for his aid.	The Hunt For Sylvanas	It's true then? Gilneas has lost her favorite son. We will mourn when this is all over but not a day sooner. We will not allow ourselves the luxury of grief while the enemy still breathes Gilnean air. My father's men are ready to strike while we still have the Banshee Queen's trail. Just say the word if you're ready. Liam deserves swift vengeance. 
Retrieve the Thelgen Seismic Record from Thelgen Rock.	Down In Thelgen Rock	I'm feeling slightly less wobbly now, so I'm going to start setting up the level for my final measurements here. There's one last thing I need from you. There's a seismograph set up deep within Thelgen Rock to record any movements in the earth. If things have been continuing to shift since the cataclysm, this'll tell us. The seismograph's at the very bottom of the cave; find it and bring the record it's created back to me. 
Obtain 16 Dark Iron Pillows.	Kill 'em With Sleep Deprivation	It's a little known fact that dwarves, particularly of the Dark Iron variety, need rest! Lots of rest! Now I ask you; How can they sleep without pillows? Exactly, George, they can't. This is why you must steal their pillows. Once you've finished your cushion-thievery, talk with Taskmaster Scrange. He's a bit deeper in the cave, working on a covert project with Hansel. 
Collect 6 Deepfin Plunder.	Treasure Reclamation	Blood and thunder! We have our reinforcements, but they still need to be paid. They won't be cheap. Up on Deepfin Ridge to the northwest, the slimy gilblin have stolen all sorts of treasure. It's time to reclaim some of it for the Horde. Hellscream's eyes are upon you, George! 
Report your findings to Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.	Big Trouble in Moonbrook	I'll be filling out my report and heading back to Stormwind shortly. SI: 7 must be informed of the happenings in Westfall. I would recommend you do the same and report back to Gryan. 
Speak with Eric ""The Swift"" at Dragon's Mouth in the Badlands.	The Swift, the Fierce, and the Stout	In my haste to escape from Lethlor Ravine, I forgot to tie up one loose end: Nyxondra. She's free, and she's sounded the alarm among the black dragonflight. Half the flight is here in the western Badlands, combing for this egg. I'll take care of hiding the egg. You're going to take care of some of the more troublesome dragons. And you'll have help. Talk to Eric, over on the other side of camp. He and his brothers will be joining you. 
Rouse 8 Orc Sea Dogs.	Hair of the Dog	Thank the Warchief that you're here, George. I've made a critical error with the sea dogs and need your help to rectify the situation. You see, I sent them out against the worgen coming from Fenris Isle stone cold sober. They attacked the beasts and promptly got their butts handed to them. Many of them died, but a few still live, barely clinging on to dear life. Take this barrel of ale to the Decrepit Fields, east of here, and force it down the throats of fallen sea dogs. 
Travel to the farm house in Gahrron's Withering and gather any mementos you can find.	Memories from a Lost Past	It's funny the things you remember. I spent 16 hours a day working the fields, and every seventh day I'd head into bustling Andorhal to sell what I'd grown. It was a tough life, but we did alright. But I barely remember any of that. When I think back to those days, I think about Gloria's smile, or Andrea waving from the window whenever I'd look up from the plow. The farm's just a bit to the east, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go back, George. I'd just like to make sure I hold on to these memories. 
Give the Partially Digested Head to Lord Godfrey in Silverpine Forest.	I Never Forget a Face	You have discovered a partially digested head. Lord Godfrey perks up when he sees it. Perhaps you should give it to him. 
Kill Mok'rash the Cleaver at Janeiro's Point.	Mok'rash the Cleaver	Mok'rash the Cleaver is the last of the lot. And the largest, by my memory. Taller than a wave in a windstorm, with a beard like a kelp forest and a hammer like an oak tree. He taunts me from Janeiro's Point, the island right off the end of this very pier. It's because of him that I'm still trapped here, living this lamentable landlubber's life. If you can swim, then head out to Janeiro's Point and slay Mok'rash. Take care, George. Mok'rash will not lay down as easily as his brothers. 
Obtain Grol's Amulet from the Shattershore in the Blasted Lands.	The Amulet of Grol	Grol... the ogre.<Kasim laughs.>It would seem that Grol's body no longer rests with the ogres. His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east. His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to Razelikh, and therein lies our chance to stop his madness. 
Mar'nah at the Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to gather 5 Bloodberries from the bushes found on Quel'Danas.	Open for Business	Welcome, George. There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here. For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir. The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of Azeroth and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance. I've learned though, that when exposed to the Sunwell's power this plant takes on special properties that can be distilled and imbibed to magnify one's abilites. Bring me a sample from the nearby bushes and I'll show you what I mean. 
Kill 10 Nightbane Shadow Weavers at the Rotting Orchard.	The Rotting Orchard	The worgen infestation stretches further than Brightwood Grove. To the south, on the very edges of Darkshire itself, the Rotting Orchard is host to even more of the savage beasts. The worgen there are more cunning, George, but just as savage and evil. They conjure foul shadows to tear their enemies apart from a distance. Go to the Rotting Orchard, and slay the Shadow Weavers to keep the town safe! 
Kill 10 Kvaldir defenders in the Ruins of Vashj'ir. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Reoccupation	There's no shortage of Kvaldir to slaughter. They're obviously still reeling from our assault. The city has been desolate so long, I doubt they expected any naga to contest them here. There have been no reports yet of their leader. I'm sure that culling them further will force the coward to rear his head soon enough. Shall we continue? 
Kill 7 Idra'kess Sentinels and 7 Idra'kess Enchantresses.	Stick it to Them	I may be unable to communicate directly with the beast Nespirah, but I can still feel some things indirectly. For example, I can clearly sense that Nespirah is not happy about the naga's presence here. When we first entered Nespirah's body, I saw dozens of sentinels and enchantresses patrolling the central chamber floor. Perhaps some of the ancient one's pain will be alleviated if you remove them. 
Find and return the Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass.	Recon Essentials	We used to have more stuff around here. I think there was a spyglass somewhere nearby, along with a smithing tuyere. I'm pretty certain that they've been stolen by Dark Iron dwarves. Yes, I know that I'm a Dark Iron dwarf! I'm talking about the bad ones that live down in that gorge. You'd best check the steamsmiths that work just south of here. They'd be most likely to use tools like these. 
Bring the Crate of Dragonmaw Bandages back to Warlord Krogg off the coast of Dragonmaw Port.	Dangerous Compassion	The red dragonflight represents the aspect of life. As such, their blood has healing properties. This crate of bandages has been soaked in red dragon blood. It is the last of my supply. May it bring a speedy recovery to your warriors. Whatever the outcome of your negotiations here, do not forget that you have friends among the Dragonmaw. 
Collect 10 piles of Verrall River Muck.	Cementing Our Victory	Our alliance with the Dragonmaw is secured, but this port is far from combat ready. These flimsy wooden walls are an embarrassment to the Warchief. When water elementals carve their way through rock, as they have in the Verrall River, they create a peculiar kind of muck. It spreads easily and dries harder than the hardest stone. It's the perfect mortar for large-scale construction. Go to the river delta northwest of here and collect some Verrall River muck. Even a little will go a long way. 
Render 5 Sunreaver Dragonhawks incapable of flying.	Nowhere to Run	Compliant Sunreavers will be sent to the Violet Hold. Defiant ones are put to the sword. NONE are to escape. The Sunreavers keep their dragonhawk mounts on Krasus' Landing. Take this dust, and use it to render them incapable of flying. Or kill them. I don't care. 
Kill 5 Vilebranch Blood Drinkers and 5 Vilebranch Soul Eaters in Jintha'Alor.	It's Ours Now	Only the strongest and foulest Vilebranch are left now. The soul eaters and blood drinkers, foul worshippers of the evil god Hakkar. Don't forget you're not just fighting trolls here, George. You're fighting dark and evil forces that'll churn this land into ash if we let them live! Show no mercy! 
Kill 10 Muckskin Scroungers.	Hostile Waters	Fiasco came out here with a balloon of some sort that he retrieved from one of our ships. He tried to float it to the top, but those Muckskin Scroungers came out of nowhere and swarmed the thing. He's got an idea for another balloon, but we need to make sure that the past doesn't repeat itself. I need you to kill off those giblins. Or at the very least, enough of them to make them fear us. 
Speak with Ornak in Dragonmaw Port. Horzog can provide you with quick transportation to the shore.	Stalled Negotiations	The Warchief's whereabouts are unknown! But we have to keep his plan moving forward. George, you look like you can get things done. Our negotiations with the Dragonmaw have stalled. Their Warchief is... not what we expected. I need you to go in there and get negotiations back on track. Meet with Ornak on the shore, he'll fill you in. Talk to Horzog on deck here for quick transportation to the shore. 
Slay 9 Dustbelcher ogres at Camp Kosh.	Easily Swayed	The most immediate threat to Fuselight is, without argument, the colony of ogres to the northwest. Most of our ogre neighbors used to be warrior-types, but it seems that more and more of them are practicing magic. I won't have an army of ogre-magi at my doorstep. Go take out some of those Dustbelcher ogres. Hopefully they'll get the picture and avoid messing with the might of Fuselight. 
Speak with Prospector Whelgar at Whelgar's Retreat, southeast of Swiftgear Station.	Whelgar's Retreat	Prospector Whelgar's been leading an excavation in the mountains southeast of here for quite some time. He had some raptor problems back in the day, but things were going better recently. Just the other day, we got word he had to evacuate the entire digsite again. I'm not sure what's going on there, but I can't imagine the cataclysm making a quarry any safer than it was before. There's good dwarves working there, George. Would you go see what's wrong there, and maybe lend a hand? 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar in Deadwind Pass.	Demon in Disguise	While you were... working your magic on that demon, I was able to make headway in distilling the corrupted essences down to a simpler, more manageable form. I've asked Khadgar to provide you with the concoction once he's had a look, but I must remind you - these essences are quite potent, often dangerous if not handled with the utmost of care. Speak with Khadgar when you are ready to begin. 
Collect 8 Muckdweller Glands.	Bravo Company Field Kit: Chloroform	The first part of this mission is all covert ops, George. To that end, we need to be able to incapacitate the enemy without making any sounds. To do that we're going to need chloroform. The muckdwellers at the bottom of Lake Everstill hold chloroform in their glands. I'm going to need you to go underwater and recover muckdweller glands. Think you can handle it? Come back to me once you've recovered enough glands. Where's the lake you ask? Open your eyes, dummy. Directly west. 
Protect Kinelory until she returns to Quae.	Kinelory Strikes	All right, George. I'm ready if you are. Shall we? 
Speak to Keegan Firebeard at Firebeard's Patrol.	Personal Request	Shame about the Doyles. It's a fair miracle that as many of us made it out as is though, so can't count it as much of a surprise. Those louts at Thundermar are cowards. Even after tellin' them it was Keegan askin', they won't set foot outside of their town. I did rope in the Moores though, so that's at least three clans' worth. Keegan wanted to hear from ya personally when you returned. Go find'm in town. 
Deliver the Splinterspear Report to Dispatch Commander Ruag in Stonard.	Ruag's Report	Here is Ruag's report, George. Let him know his scout is still here. Do not speak of Helgrum. I will not distract others with news of tragedy. I have to be strong. We all have to be strong. 
Gather 5 Wolf Skirt Steaks from Dire Wolves.	Seasoned Wolf Kabobs	Seasoned wolf kabobs are a house favorite! Sure, I can make you some. But first I'll need the supplies. Bring me five wolf skirt steaks. The dire wolves near the river north of town are good to hunt; I wouldn't stray too far into the woods if I were you. 
Report to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp in Northern Stranglethorn.	Rebels Without a Clue	Several years ago, Stormwind's Captain Kurzen brought a brigade into Stranglethorn Vale on a mission whose details are still murky. Kurzen swiftly descended into madness, as did his men... except for a few rebels who made it their mission to undo the evils that Kurzen had wrought. As I said, that was years ago. I'm now hearing rumors that Kurzen is dead, but those rebels still persist at their rebellion. If you wish to investigate, you'll find them at a camp on Stranglethorn's northern border. 
Evacuate 3 Civilian Homes.	Evacuate the Merchant Square	The civilians aren't safe here anymore. Not even inside their homes. We're doing our best to stop the worgen from getting indoors, but their numbers are too great. Help us by evacuating the civilian homes. My father's army in the prison district will be able to better protect them. 
Collect Grent Direhammer's boots.	Bury Me With Me Boots...	Ah... It's you, George. Mauti... He's dead? Then my brother has been avenged. I've only one request from ya... This scamp here, he's been pawing at me bare feet. No dwarf should go to the earth with bare feet. Please, bury me with me boots. 
Kill 10 Dun Garok Spirits.	Silence of the Dwarves	The spirits of my soldiers haunt this fort now, <lad/lass>. Their souls are now bound to this place. Even in death they continue to fight for it. 'Tis sad. Put 'em out o' their misery and perhaps ye shall have the spoils of yer people's victory. 
Board the Repaired Bomber and use the Iron Hammer Bomb to kill 30 Dark Iron attackers. You may kill any of the Dark Iron dwarves or their allies at the Ironforge Airfield.	Striking Back	My chief engineer tells me that he's managed to get one of the bombers repaired and airworthy. Take these bombs with you, and look for the repaired bomber at the start of the runway. Once you're airborne, use the bombs to do as much damage to the attacking Dark Iron dwarves as you can. I've heard rumors that they're preparing to deploy a new kind of war golem. Keep your eyes peeled for those golems and make them your highest priority targets. 
Meet with Fiasco Sizzlegrin on Biel'aran Ridge.	Desperate Plan	Toldrek and Fiasco left to find a way to contact help. The trade lanes aren't far, so there might be a chance of success, but I'm wary to let anyone get their hopes up. In truth, we don't have any other options. We're not likely to last much longer here. The naga will find us eventually, and... well... you saw how many of them there were. You should go find the two of them on Biel'aran Ridge to the southeast. I'll keep everyone here safe as long as I can. 
Speak with a Siege Tank Commander standing on top of a crippled Highbank Siege Tank. Defend the tank while engineers make repairs.	Siege Tank Rescue	One by one, we're gonna have to pull our siege tanks outta the muck. Take these 'ere spare parts you've collected and give 'em to a siege tank commander who's standing on top of a gimped-up machine. Then defend the tank while engineers de-gimpify it. Go an' make me proud, Mechanic! 
Go to the Westbrook Garrison and speak with Deputy Rainer.	Westbrook Garrison Needs Help!	The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity. They're requesting we send more Stormwind soldiers... but we just don't have any to spare! If you can help, we could use it. Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done. The Garrison is down the road to the west. After you cross the bridge over the small brook it will be to the right. 
Collect 6 Barrels of Wildhammer Ale.	A Steady Supply	Hey bud. Seeing as how you're so friendly and great and all, think you might do a dwarf a favor? These are Dunwald ruins... there's SURE to be more stock in some of these buildings. If you come upon more ale, bring it my way, will ya? A good dwarf can never have enough! I'm thinkin' I'll find my way back to Keely, so ya might have to hunt me down, but I'll try'n make it worth it to ya. 
Report to Commander Ashlam Valorfist at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands.	Victory, For Now	The Alliance are victorious, and our forces are still strong. Military strategy dictates that we attack the Forsaken now, while they are recovering and unaware. I made a deal, however...We will wait. We attack Koltira and his troops when the time is right. In the meantime, speak with Ginny Goodwin and take a flight to the Chillwind Camp, to our south. Commander Ashlam Valorfist will give you your next assignment. You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal. 
Find Gidwin Goldbraids at Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.	Boys Will Be Boys	As soon as we arrived here at Light's Shield Tower, those two lunkhead paladins ran off to Light's Hope Chapel. It's still a ways away, but if we're going to follow Argus along his tour of the towers, this is about as close as we're going to get. Check in on them and make sure they're alright? I know they can handle themselves, but still, it'd make me feel better to know that you were watching over them while I'm stuck here with the caravan. 
Free 8 Darrowshire Spirits from the bodies of Cannibal Ghouls, then speak with them.	Defenders of Darrowshire	The battle of Darrowshire was one of the many tragedies that we humans suffered at the hands of the Scourge. Its effects are still felt even today. Many of the town's valiant defenders now roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge. We will end their misery. Hunt cannibal ghouls here within the Plaguewood. Many of these fiends were once the good folk of Darrowshire, and destroying their forms now will set their souls free. 
Kill 9 Plagued Swine.	A Fate Worse Than Butchery	The people of Terrordale, they were sick, then they turned bad. Definitely not good times. The pigs, though... they also got sick! What did pigs do to deserve to get sick? Hah hah hah! Nothing! People I can forget about, but the bad pigs still make me sad. If you kill them, though... I might get happy. 
Speak with Wyrtle Spreelthonket and ask him to release Magma Lord Kolob. Then defeat Magma Lord Kolob in battle.	Trial by Magma	I suppose I'll make the most of this situation. These goblin mercenaries brought this enormous fire elemental to my stronghold as a ""thank you"" for hiring them. What am I going to do with an elemental here in the steppes? That's like bringing sand to the beach. If you're looking for work, then prove yourself. Talk to this goblin here, and challenge his elemental to a fight. The victor earns my respect, and my time. 
Speak to Newt to secure a ride back to Krazzworks, then give the Induction Samophlange to Captain Krazz.	Krazz Works!	That's it. We're all wrapped up. Let's ship out. Newt's got some gyrocopters tethered at the top of the tower. Go meet up with her for a quick trip back to Krazzworks. We'll mop up here. 
Speak to Kurdran Wildhammer inside of the Highbank Keep in Twilight Highlands.	Kurdran's Waitin'	It looks like the attack stopped, George. Which is a shame, 'cuz we never got to use the Mechanic-rocket. Anyways, Kurdran Wildhammer is up in the top of the keep an' I'm sure he'll be wantin' to gives ya a hero's welcome. Yeh earned it! Go talk to 'im! I'll move on ahead and scout out the beach. 
Obtain 5 Unearthed Mementos.	Laid to Rest	In our hurried escape for safety, we disturbed the resting homes of our ancestors, George. A grave sin, if you'll pardon the pun. It is tradition that a small memento be buried on top of a Gilnean's graveyard, beneath the shallow earth. The stampede of people fleeing these tunnels has unearthed these mementos and angered the spirits. Find them and bring them to me. We'll see to it that the dead return to their eternal slumber. 
Kill 12 Dire Wolves.	Wolves at Our Heels	The dire wolves are the most common threat to the townsfolk here. They lurk in the forests on all sides of us, though most are along the north bank of the river. These aren't the runt dogs you see in Elwynn, or wherever you come from. They're big as a man and twice as vicious. If you wish to assist the people of Darkshire, hunt the dire wolves so our streets can be safer. 
Kill 8 Rotting Horrors near Blind Mary's Haunt, southeast of Darkshire.	The Night Watch	I'm afraid you're all I've got to help here, George. Stormwind's forces are so taxed by greater evils that they can't spare a single footman to protect Darkshire. It's up to me and the rest of the Night Watch to keep our homes safe. There's more threats here than just wolves, unfortunately. Rotting horrors roam near Blind Mary's Haunt, on the southeast outskirts. If they're not kept in check, they'll be visiting our homes in the night. Deal with the undead and report back to me for your bounty. 
Ride the mine cart with Initiate Goldmine to the end of the line.	Mr. Goldmine's Wild Ride	Okay, George, we need to get to the earth portal at the back of the cave. I've ""procured"" a ride for us. Why walk when we can ride in style? I hope you don't mind mine carts. Let me know when you're ready. 
Bring the Mistmantle Family Ring to Madame Eva.	Clawing at the Truth	This can't be. My brother was strong-willed, but such vileness... such sickness and violent, bloody evil...<Tobias brings a hand to his face, averting his gaze.>I must have answers. I need to know how I got that letter. I need to know if Stalvan really did this. I need to know why...Take my ring, George. Bring it to Madame Eva. That woman is a follower of old arts and makes no secret of it... call it madness, but I'll try anything at this point. 
Kill Shadra the Venom Queen.	Shadra the Venom Queen	<The ground rumbles as the idol sits on the altar, and the lake below roils! Shadra is emerging!> 
Safeguard 5 Vermillion Menders as they heal wounded dragons.	Draconic Mending	Our dragons are returning from battle covered in Twilight corrupted flame and pursued by Twilight drakes. My menders can tend to our dragons' wounds, but they must be defended. Keep the drakes off of my menders. Lend your healing to our dragons as well if you are able. Thank you for your help with this. Our battles for Grim Batol are never-ending. We need to get our strongest dragons back into the battle as soon as possible. 
Rescue 6 Orc Sea Dogs from the Skittering Dark.	Lost in the Darkness	Some would say that we are lucky to be alive. Those people would be idiots. At least had we died we would not have had to face the Warchief's wrath. Alas, what's done is done! Now we must attempt to regain our lost honor. The third ship in our fleet sank off the coast of the Skittering Dark, northwest of here. Those that made it to shore quickly found themselves swarmed by the giant spiders of the area and encased in webbing. If there are survivors we must free them! Go, George! To the Skittering Dark! 
Possess a Bound Torrent and then slay 50 Twilight Devotees and 10 Faceless Overseers.	Twilight Extermination	NOW, TAKE... THE ATTUNED RUNESTONE... AND USE... IT TO POSSESS... ONE OF... THE BOUND TORRENTS... AT... THE CENTRAL TEMPLE. THEY WILL IGNORE... YOU. YOU ARE BENEATH... THEIR NOTICE. USE... THE ELEMENTAL'S POWERS... TO DESTROY... THE TWILIGHT DEVOTEES... AND... THEIR... FACELESS OVERSEERS. 
Return to Colonel Troteman.	This Ain't My War	They asked me to fight in those wars. I didn't ask them! I did what I had to do to win. So I end up getting captured by those filthy, crap-swilling, maggot orcs and for five long years they used me as a toilet. Finally I break out and head back to my hometown and what do I get? People spitting on me, protesting me, calling me a baby orc killer and all kinds of vile crap! No, I don't think I'll be helping you. You go back to Troteman and you tell him that this ain't my war. 
Collect 5 Dark Assassin Pendants.	Dark Assassins	Even I get hunted. I suppose that's what I get for hiding amongst the sheep.<Mathias studies you for a moment.>The Twilight's Hammer has taken it up a notch and sent their dark assassins after me. Nice bunch of guys. Dead now. They're made from the souls of the most skilled killers. Want to do me a favor? Hunt them down. Bring back their soul pendants. 
Slay 10 Bloodwash Barbarians and 10 Bloodwash Enchantresses.	Atrocities	<Though his lips do not move, you can feel the murloc chief speaking to you.>The Bloodwash naga and the Rockpool murloc have lived among one another for as long as we could remember. We have always had our differences, but never provoked one another. Why, then, would they turn on us?<Neptool looks over his shoulder at his former villagers.>You see what they do now? They enslave us, sacrifice us, force us to fight one another. I will stop them, Human... and you will be my weapon. 
Sabotage 3 Iron Demolishers.	Under Siege	Those Iron Horde cannons are laying waste to our troops. I'm not sure how much more of this we can handle. Our forces are already spread too thin. There has to be a way to stop those war machines. 
Kill 30 Twilight's Hammer cultists along Wyrm's Bend as you fight towards the entrance to Grim Batol.	Paving the Way	My orders are to accompany you south through the Dragonmaw Gates towards the entrance of Grim Batol. We're to clear a path so that the rest of the men can follow us up and secure the entrance. Translation: kill everything that moves, and don't be ashamed if you have a good time doing it. The boys are getting antsy. Let's go. 
Obtain Nezzliok's Head from Nezzliok the Dire in Zul'Kunda.	Nezzliok Will Know	Yenniku was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it. But we are no closer to finding him. We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp witchdoctor will know it. He is an enemy of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from his dead lips! Bring me the head of Nezzliok the Dire and place it within this cauldron. He is deep within Zul'Kunda. Bring his head...we will then make it talk. 
Speak to Voggah Deathgrip at Alterac Mountains in Hillsbrad Foothills.	Aid of the Frostwolf	I will study the Stormpike battle plans and prepare for an assault. I need you to go to Alterac Valley and enlist the aid of the Frostwolf Clan: the very clan of our former warchief, Thrall. They will help us battle the Stormpike dwarves! Together, we will crush the invaders and see them driven out of Lordaeron for good! Go now, George. Alterac Valley is northeast of Tarren Mill. Find Voggah Deathgrip and tell him that the Horde requires the aid of the Frostwolf! LOK'TAR! 
Find 6 Stormwind SEAL Equipment.	Stormwind Elite Aquatic and Land Forces	You've done us a great service, Mechanic, so I'm going to let you in on a little secret. The men you've saved today aren't your everyday Stormwind troops. We belong to a special detachment of elite soldiers sent here not only to contend with the Horde, but to investigate the massive geological disturbances originating from the nearby sea floor. I tell you this because our top secret equipment lies in the bottom of some of our wrecked ships here. That gear must be retrieved! 
Take the Alliance S.E.A.L. Equipment to Legionnaire Nazgrim at The Immortal Coil.	Helm's Deep	This helm and its associated components are marked with the seal of Stormwind. It was no doubt cast off from an Alliance ship that suffered a similar fate to yours. Looking closer, this seems far too intricate and sturdy to be everyday diving equipment. Perhaps Nazgrim can make some sense of this... 
Velan Brightoak at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods wants you to bring him 6 Springpaw Pelts.	Pelt Collection	The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts. We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them. Our skirmishes with the Amani have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our rangers don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore. If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor. You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here. 
Wait for Guzbert Gizmoflank and Kelsey Steelspark to return.	Blood on the Sand	And with that, our mission is done. Let's verify that Guzbert and Kelsey return safely from their demo sites, and then we can head back to friendlier shores. 
Report to Watcher Mahar Ba in the mage tower at Nethergarde Keep.	Watcher Mahar Ba	It's time for you to visit the Watcher. He's been in a bit of a mood lately, and I'm not quite sure why. Head up to the top of the mage tower and check in with him. I don't have any work for you here, but I'm certain that he will. 
Find Tarenar Sunstrike at Death's Step in Eastern Plaguelands.	Tarenar Sunstrike	As soon as we stopped, they made a bet about ""who could kill the most undead in five minutes.""It's been an hour, and I'm still waiting for them to come back. I saw Tarenar run off to the southeast. Unfortunately, I can't leave the caravan here by itself. If you end up traveling in that direction, could you find him and send him back to me? 
Speak to Mackay Firebeard at the Gorshak War Camp.	Firebeard Bellows	I also need ya to seek out Mackay and his men on the other side of the Devouring Breach, at the Gorshak War Camp. The Dragonmaw didn't survive the initial onslaught, and Mackay's lookin' to ransack what he can of their camp to supply our fight. There shouldn't be much convincin' necessary, but they'll likely want a hand wrappin' things up there before they make their way back to Keegan. Give'm a boot in the arse from ol' Iain if ya have to. 
Retrieve a Twilight Caravan Gatestone. The Spearwardens should carry keys that can get you into the gatestone chests.	Precious Goods	The gates further down the canyon are shut. Our scouting revealed some kind of stone that they carry in chests in their caravans that they use to open the gates. Get down there and look for a chest key on the bodies of the guards. When you find it, use it on one of those chests on the caravan wagons and bring the gatestone back to me. 
Obtain 6 Skullsplitter Mojos from Skullsplitter trolls in the Ziata'jai Ruins and the Balia'mah Ruins.	Skullsplitter Mojo	<The skull speaks again.>I have my body, thanks to you, your raptor, and Gan'zulah. Now, if I remember correctly, you and your witch doctor friend will need some mojo to complete this ritual. The Bloodscalps keep mojo in Zul'Kunda, but it is weak. Your Darkspears' mojo will not work either. No... you want to take from the Skullsplitter trolls, across the river to the east. Hurry back, Human. I will be watching... 
Obtain 5 Jungle Stalker Feathers from Jungle Stalkers in Northern Stranglethorn.	Mind Vision	To know Mandokir, you must see Mandokir. To see Mandokir, you must use eyes of raptor. You have formed bond with raptor: Ohgan'aka: daughter of Ohgan. To strengthen bond, we need feathers. You will go west, and you will find the feathers, yes. 
Gather 5 Rot Blossoms from Tranquil Gardens Cemetery.	Gather Rot Blossoms	If you bring me some rot blossoms then I can brew you up a batch of zombie juice. rot blossoms grow in strange places. They tend to flourish on dead things, and Duskwood has its fair share of those! I've seen a few of them growing at Tranquil Gardens Cemetery lately. Check near the graves... but mind the dead that are walking about near there. 
Kill Jungle Serpents and inspect the poisoned adventurers to allow Bwemba to heal them.	Serpents and Poison	Because of the emissary's warning we were able to gather more adventurers to help defend. But we thought we were going to be fighting trolls. Instead we found ourselves overwhelmed by serpents! They seem to have come from everywhere. We are barely able to hold on, and I only suspect it's going to get worse. Help us and eliminate the serpents and perhaps your troll friend here can use some magic to cure the poisoned. 
Speak to Gwen Armstead in the Military District to the southeast.	Royal Orders	It's time for you to leave, George. Go to the Military District with the other civilians. Check in with Gwen Armstead when you cross the bridge to the southeast... see if everyone's okay. I will stay here with the guards and cover the civilians' retreat. Go now. That is an order! 
Get the Keg of Gunpowder from Budd's Dig.	Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark	Mack's still out of it, and I fear we may lose him if I can't get this fire started. With the wood being soaked, we'll need something special to get it going. There's an abandoned camp nearby with a barrel of explosives in it. There's no way I can recover it on my own. Would you mind hauling it back for us? For Mack? 
Collect 7 Wiggleweed Sprouts from Shimmerspine Harvesters in The Clutch.	What? What? In My Gut...?	Wha...what IS this!?There's great pain growing... from deep in my bowels. I think... ugh... they must have poisoned me! They fed us strangely glowing seaweed that they grow around their stronghold...I think these cramps will worsen if I don't get more soon...Please, Human. Try to find me some! 
Speak with Earthmender Duarn inside of Nespirah to activate her bio-defenses, then escape from Nespirah's body.	Waking the Beast	Thanks to you and the Legionnaire, Nespirah has full control of her body... but most of the naga don't know this yet. Once we make our escape, she will activate her biological defenses and destroy the naga from within. Make yourself ready... I will now tell Nespirah to begin the countdown. 
Return the Harvest Watcher Heart to Farmer Saldean at Saldean's Farm.	Heart of the Watcher	You have found what appears to be the heart of a harvest watcher. From the sound being emitted by the device you can tell that it's still fully functional. Perhaps you should return it to Farmer Saldean. 
Use Antheol's Disciplinary Rod on his two students: Apprentice Ralen and Apprentice Meledor. Return to Antheol at Stillwhisper Pond in Eversong Woods with the rod after this.	Swift Discipline	I hope you learn a valuable lesson today, George. Never trust someone else to lie for you. Now I want you to go back to my two dimwitted students and discipline them using this wand. My magic tells me that you'll find them along the road to the west on the other side of the Dead Scar. Come back to me after you've done this. I'll give you a small reward for your troubles. 
Report to Gor'mul at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.	Hammerfall	You have served us well here, George. Now that we've made our mark, the next phase of our conquest will occur over months rather than minutes. There is much work yet to be done, and I will spare you the tedium of waiting for our fortifications to trickle in. Travel to the east, to Hammerfall. The orcs there will no doubt have use of your aid. 
Beat down at least 6 Scourge Siege Engineers to discover details about Gidwin's location and his captor.	Beat it Out of Them	We paladins are normally taught to exercise judgment and control when dealing with foes, but this is an emergency, and I never paid too much attention to my trainers anyhow. I'm going to head into the Plaguewood and find out what I can about Giddy. You deal with the Scourge just to our northeast, on the other side of this tower. The undead don't fear death, but if you beat them enough, their tongues might slip, and we may get some clues to Gidwin's location. 
Kill any 15 Naga at the Eastern Strand.	Preemptive Strike	These plans document what appears to be an imminent attack on Southshore. The naga of the Eastern Strand are planning to take over the town now that the Alliance has been pushed out. Not if you can help it! Kill all of the naga on the Eastern Strand and report to Helcular at the Ruins of Southshore with the Daggerspine attack plan. 
Collect 5 Ooze-Coated Supply Crates.	Skulk Rock Supplies	I had a cousin in the second war! He used to tell me all about when they led a raid on Skulk Rock. Swept in there and drove the trolls out like rats from a nest. They chased right after 'em all the way to Alterac! The slimes moved in right quick after that, and there's still cratefuls of old Horde goods sittin' in there. I say we don't let the trolls get it back! Bring me back a few crates from Skulk Rock to the northwest. 
Speak with Grimand Elmore in Stormwind.	Elmore's Task	There's a dwarven weaponsmith in Stormwind, Grimand Elmore, who sent word that he needs help with a delivery. I believe he wants a package sent to his homeland in the north. You have a sturdy pair on you! So if you're interested in some legwork then speak with Grimand. We could use you down here, but we must also keep our ties strong with the dwarves. You can find Grimand Elmore at the weapon shop in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, in the northeast section of town. 
Use the Tiki Torch to set fire to 8 Tiki Masks at Jintha'Alor.	Faces of Evil	The Vilebranch have hung their tiki masks all across the walls of Jintha'Alor. We won't tolerate their foul hexes and dark magic. It's time to send a message, and tear down their defenses, all at once! Take this torch, Mechanic. Set fire to their tiki masks and watch 'em burn. They'll know the Wildhammer want them gone when they see their dark idols consumed! 
Slay Yorla Darksnare.	Yorla Darksnare	I've found out who's pulling the strings on this operation here. Yorla Darksnare is directing the Dark Iron dwarves from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the gnolls steal Ironforge's gold in the first place. What's more, she's a wanted criminal... she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against Ironforge since Magni was still alive. She can't slip through our fingers this time, George. Go and get her! 
Obtain 4 samples of Vicious Night Web Spider Venom.	A Little Oomph	<Dithers samples his latest concoction.>Hmm... this isn't quite there. It needs something to give it a little more zing. I've got it! The spiders to the north have a potent venom that'll do the trick. See if you can extract some for me, George? 
Deliver Brubaker's Report to John J. Keeshan at Camp Everstill in Redridge.	Unspeakable Atrocities	<You unfold the note and begin reading.>Keeshan, if you're reading this note, I'm dead. Likely that my position was compromised. Orcs are committing unspeakable atrocities against their prisoners. Yes, prisoners, Keeshan. They've got cages full of P.O.W's. If you're gonna blow up this valley, you'll need to free the prisoners first. Tell my wife I love her and to take out the damned trash.-BrubakerPS - They've got black dragons. Take Brubaker's report back to Keeshan. 
Report to Archmage Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands.	The Brotherhood of Light	The Brotherhood of Light has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions. They bridged a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn. They were among the first to plunge into Northrend, while many of us lingered behind. However, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect. They fight on two fronts now: one battle in Stratholme, and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand. I suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand. You may be of service. 
Talk to Uchek in The Gullet. From the spirit realm, use your Light of Souls to keep yourself safe while you visit the three shrines inside the cave.	Night Terrors	Me friend Uchek is in de cave already. We set up three shrines inside. All you gotta do is flush out de bad juju from each one, mon. Go inside de cave here and talk to Uchek. He put you in a trance, put you in de spirit realm. Tread carefully! If you see a ghostly beast, you don't be panicking. Shine de Light of Souls on de beast for a moment or two, and de light will send 'em away for good. De light will keep you safe. Now go cleanse de three shrines! 
Bring the Filled Soul Gem to Nimboya.	Saving Yenniku	I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem. Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul. My suspicions that I spoke of earlier were correct: the spirits tell me that Yenniku dwells not with Zanzil the Outcast, but within the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe, to the southwest. Once you have freed Yenniku's spirit, return to Nimboya at Grom'gol. 
Collect 5 Atal'ai Artifacts from the Pool of Tears surrounding the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.	Pool of Tears	The trolls that lurk within this temple have done grievous harm to my kind, George. We were sent here to guard this place, and were instead used to unleash the terrible powers within. I must beg you for the help only a mortal can give. You can be my hand within the temple; should I enter by myself, I risk being turned against my brothers as well. We shall make a pact. If you wish to help, first gather Atal'ai artifacts from the waters around the temple, and return them to me. 
Slay Hr'nglth the Lost.	The Darkest Depths	I've been seeing sea creatures acting oddly through the whole swamp. The murlocs, yes, but before that the gilblins, and the makrura... I even saw some naga wander ashore the other day. Something's calling them here, and working them into a frenzy to boot. Many of the creatures have been drawn to Stagalbog Cavern to the west. Something's down there, and if it gets any stronger we'll all start wandering in there too...You should put a stop to whatever it is before that happens. 
Kill 6 Blackrock Worgs.	Beating Them Back!	Another Alliance recruit, eh? I'm Marshal McBride, commander of this garrison. We don't see many of your kind here, Human, but we could sure use the help. You've arrived just in time. The Blackrock orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are doing the best that they can to push them back, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon. Head northwest into the forest and kill the attacking Blackrock worgs! Help my soldiers! 
Adarrah wants you to recover 6 Adarrah's Keepsakes.	A Girl's Best Friend	Let's just get it out in the open. I'm no stranger to love, George. Over the years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that love's tangible treasures last longer than the flames of passion. I've managed to collect my fair share of these gifts - gemstones, rings, necklaces, and the like, and I carry them with me wherever I go. At least I used to...When I was swept from the ship, my valuables were scattered across the sea. Help me recover them and I promise to make it worth your trouble. 
Bring Razzle Sprysprocket 8 Gyromechanic Gears.	Operation Recombobulation	I should go back to Gnomeregan and continue researching a cure for irradiated gnomes. But, I stayed behind in Kharanos because the town is my home and I wanted to help defend it from the Frostmane attacks. I've been working on maintaining and repairing the steam tanks. For some reason, Frostmane scavengers have taken a liking to the gyromechanic gears I need to complete the repairs. They're all over the Frostmane Front to the southeast of town. Will you help me get those gears back? 
Speak with Anchorite Traska at the Quel'Danil Lodge.	Quel'Danil Lodge	I may appear far from home to you, Mechanic, but quite a few of my people were led here by Ambassador Rualeth. We have settled with the high elves of the Quel'Danil Lodge, to the northwest, to train in the ways of the Light and enjoy the peaceful beauty of this land. Such peace may be short lived. We have seen the Horde moving further west from here. Could you travel to Quel'Danil and give warning to Anchorite Traska? Her cabin is just north of the main lodge. 
Speak with Captain Tharran in Kharanos.	On to Kharanos	Some of the mountaineers under Stonegrind's command were telling me about the situation out at Kharanos. When the troggs took over Frostmane Hold, it sounds like the surviving trolls fled westward, deep into the heart of the dwarven homeland. Now, they threaten the dwarven town of Kharanos. It sounds like they're going to need all the help they can get. You should go to Kharanos and introduce yourself to Captain Tharran. Just follow the road east out of Brewnall and keep going until you see the town. 
Return to Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in Zuldazar.	To Current Matters	Ye've done good here, champion. MOTHER and I will be figurin' out what te do next. Ye best get back te matters at hand, and do what ye can te empower that necklace o' yours. I've got ways te reach ye once MOTHER and I have fixed things up here. 
Gather information from the Moonbrook Rally.	The Dawning of a New Day	It looks like the meeting the shadowy figure spoke of is starting soon. The homeless are starting to mobilize. I need you to attend the rally and gather information, George. Go to the center of Moonbrook and listen in on the rally. Return to me with whatever you find out. 
Obtain 15 mugs of Shadowstout.	A Dwarf's Got Needs	I can appreciate a good diggin' as much as any other dwarf, don't get me wrong. It's just that... well, we do so much diggin', and so little drinkin', that sometimes I wonder if I should just hang up me shovel and head back to Ironforge. But not today. I've got some diggin' in me yet. Those Dark Iron dwarves at Hammertoe's Digsite - just north of here - make some powerful fine beer, right here in the desert. You think you could pick up a few for me? 
Bring Aldaron's Head to Velendris Whitemorn near Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods.	Wretched Ringleader	The Wretched are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons. We can't expect them to remain in their stupor, though. Now is the time for a decisive attack. Let us make an example of their leader, Aldaron. He was spotted on the top floor of the building by the anchorage. Bring me his head; I'll reward you suitably. 
Find Eoin Dunwald.	Eoin Dunwald	Eoin's one of the twins. He's got a penchant for the drink. You'll likely be findin' him over by the old well - the ale stores were in a building there. Mind making him to pay his worrying sister a visit? Shouldn't take much convincin' if you can get to the ale first. 
Speak to Magister Idonis in the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.	The Sanctum of the Sun	You've proven your loyalty to Tranquillien and have helped us defend it against the threat of the Scourge. Some of our most powerful magisters have come from Silvermoon to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep. They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area. They plan to launch an offensive into Deatholme, Dar'Khan's stronghold. You would do well to join them, George. I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned Mechanic like yourself. 
Obtain 7 Jungle Remedies from the Kurzen Compound.	Bad Medicine	I have a feeling that Kurzen's Medicine Men are distributing more than just medicine. Kurzen needs some way to quelch insubordination, and an elixir under the guise of ""medicine"" would be the perfect way to do that. We need those remedies for research. Search the Kurzen Compound to the southeast - his medicine men and jungle fighters should carry the remedies on their bodies. 
Slay High Shaman MacKilligan.	Bring Down the High Shaman	Our scouts in the field report that High Shaman MacKilligan has moved out of Thundermar and is fighting amidst the Thundermar Ruins northwest of here, across the river. He's a dangerous one, George, responsible for the deaths of many a Dragonmaw. He WILL be destroyed, that is not the question. The question is: will you be the one to earn the glory of the kill? 
Slay Commander Nazrim.	A Tiny, Clever Commander	We've dealt with kobolds in these lands for years. Not much other than a nuisance. But they've been getting craftier at their stealing. I think one of them's ended up smarter than usual. Won't be that way for long, though! I want you to go to the camp south of here and make sure there's not a ""big shot"" kobold stirrin' up the other ones. Make sure to check the cave; it's a likely spot. And don't be shy about clearing out the other kobolds along the way. 
Retrieve a Horde Survival Kit.	Come Prepared	It's a short swim to the top. Not much trouble really. Hard to get any supplies up there though. Too heavy. All of the ships in all of the Horde fleets stow a survival kit. I had a balloon from the old survival kit, but it fell on hard times recently. I need another survival kit. There's a ship to the southeastish. Let's hope that the survivors were dumb and didn't take the survival kit. More survival kit for us. 
Report to Mountaineer Rharen at Dun Algaz.	Hero's Call: Wetlands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Mountaineer Rharen at Dun Algaz. In the wake of the cataclysm's destruction, Wetlands has become overrun with wild beasts, orcish raiders, and savage gnolls! To reach the Wetlands, you must travel north from Loch Modan through the dwarven hold of Dun Algaz. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Collect 6 Red Bandanas.	Evidence Collection	The material of this bandana is identical to the material found at the Furlbrow murder scene. You should collect more red bandanas as evidence and return what you find to Captain Alpert. 
Collect 7 Runestones of Binding.	Runestones of Binding	ON THE OTHER... SIDE OF... MY CHAMBER THERE... ARE... CANDIDATES FOR ASCENSION. WE WILL NEED... THEIR... RUNESTONES OF BINDING... TO CREATE A... MEANS OF CONTROLLING... A BOUND ELEMENTAL. 
Kill a Dreadmaul Ambusher in Dreadmaul Hold.	Futile Pride	This is actually an old orc city... one of the oldest on Azeroth. That is, it was until the ogres pushed us out. Today's Horde refuses to be pushed over by ogres. My troops and I took the town back by force, and the ogres who once lived here now work as my servants. Now, our real work begins. You look strong enough, but I'd like to see some proof. Kill one of the ogres that still besiege us, and return to me. 
Kill Araj the Summoner. You may use Jearl's Hand Grenades to destroy Stickbone Berserkers.	Araj the Summoner	With the animus destroyed, the next logical step is to take out Araj himself, and to take a shard of his phylactery. You've probably already seen him, lurking at the fountain in the center of town. Take my grenades with you. They won't do anything to Araj, but if he decides to summon any of those skeletons, you can use them to blow them away. Again. 
Obtain 6 Bloodsail Cannonballs from the water beneath the Riptide.	Cannonball Swim	Help out a fellow swabbie? Keelhaul asked me to gather up some cannonballs at the bottom of the ocean. Let me tell you why this doesn't work for me.- One: I have tiny arms. Look at them! Do you really think I can pick up a cannonball, even underwater?- Two: I have a weak respiratory system. I start to white out after holding my breath for more than ten seconds.- Three: There are sharks. You gotta help me, George! I've been demoted as far as I can... I don't want to see what comes next! 
Kill Toothsmash the Annihilator	Toothsmash the Annihilator	If the battleplans you brought back are true, the Dreadmaul ogres are as much to blame for this devastation as the Iron Horde. It's time we send those ogres a message. It looks like the Iron Horde's main contact is a large ogre in Dreadmaul named Toothsmash. Killing him will put a dent in their battleplans. 
Slay Huntsman Leopold.	The Huntsman	We've already lost half a dozen men to a hail of bullets and arrows coming from atop this fortress. I haven't seen the face of the enemy that's firing, but I don't need to. I know the name of the man up there. Leopold. That's right, there's only one man up there, picking off my men one-by-one. And from what I can see, there's only one of you. Sounds like a fair fight to me. 
Collect 8 Snapjaw Grouper Meat.	Something Edible	Were they trying to starve us all to death?! Not giving prisoners food is just despicable. We need to get these soldiers fed. The best prospect I spotted on the way here were those giant grouper. Several of those and we shouldn't want for meat for a while. If you can bring me back some, I'll see to it that it gets cooked and passed out fairly. 
Kill 10 Azsh'ir Patrollers.	Caught Off-Guard	Our escape from the shell can't have gone unnoticed, but either the naga at these ruins weren't informed or they don't consider us a threat. I don't intend to take the opportunity for granted - we strike now. I need you to slip into the lower level of the ruins to our west and take out as many of their patrols as you can. We cannot risk any of those patrols finding out about our occupation of this cave - make sure none escape. 
Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Horde Lookouts on ledges around the north end of Quel'Dormir Gardens.	Not Entirely Unprepared	I overheard your conversation with the Captain. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us. I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time. 
Speak with Innkeeper Farley at the Lion's Pride Inn.	Rest and Relaxation	Every adventurer should rest when exhaustion sets in - and there is no finer place to get rest and relaxation than at the Lion's Pride Inn! My best friend, Innkeeper Farley, runs the Lion's Pride. If you tell him I sent you, he may give you the special discounted rates on food and drink. To find the Lion's Pride Inn, travel south along the road from here -- you can't miss it! 
Deliver the Brain of the Unfathomable to L'ghorek in the Cerebrillum inside of L'ghorek in Vashj'ir.	Communing with the Ancient	Place the dead merciless one upon your head to pose as one of their slaves. Enter L'ghorek. Commune with the ancient. 
Report to Colonel Troteman at Lakeshire in Redridge.	Return of the Bravo Company	I don't know who you are, <mister/missy>, but you've earned the respect and admiration of the Bravo Company. You've managed to save all our hides and kill a boatload of orcs in the process. Now we return the favor. Get back to Lakeshire and report to Colonel Troteman. We'll find Johnny and deliver the good news in person. With the Bravo Company back in action, these orcs don't stand a chance. 
Place the Gurubashi Challenge Flag down inside the Battle Ring, then defeat the Gurubashi Arena Challenger.	Gurubashi Challenge: Free-For-All Arena Combat	The arena is a place of battle unlike any other. Inside, you have no friends. Alliances that do form are fleeting, as your allies can turn on you in the blink of an eye. Horde vs. Alliance, Alliance vs. Alliance, Horde vs. Horde... anything goes. Take this battle standard, Human, and place it down on the arena floor. Defeat the summoned combatant, then return to me. Stay on your toes, Human. Anything goes inside the Gurubashi Arena. 
Steal the Night Elf Plans: An'daroth, Night Elf Plans: An'owyn and Night Elf Plans: Scrying on the Sin'dorei, and return them to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	Into Occupied Territory	Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by. I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship. 
Travel to the Bleeding Ziggurat and the Howling Ziggurat and recover the Stone of Light and the Stone of Flame. Return to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun after recovering the items.	The Twin Ziggurats	According to this journal, Dar'Khan promised the Scourge two powerful elven artifacts: the stone of light and the stone of flame. These were imbued with the magical energies of the Sunwell and attuned to have warding powers against the Scourge. The crystals were to be transported to where the Howling Ziggurat and the Bleeding Ziggurat now stand, in the middle of the Dead Scar. If they're still held there, we need to recover them. Their power will be greatly useful in our struggle against the enemy. 
Vindicator Xayann at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to place the Attuned Crystal Cores inside 5 defeated Erratic Sentries to turn them into friendly units.	Further Conversions	My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success. We've managed to take the Sun's Reach Sanctum with their help. I've crafted new crystals that will bring more of them under our control; place them inside the hulls of defeated sentries. We'll deploy them to other locations once they're converted. 
Use Milly's Extinguisher to put out 8 Vineyard Fires.	Extinguishing Hope	Times like these make me long for when the Defias were still around. The cataclysm has opened a pathway from the Burning Steppes and now Blackrock orcs pour into Northshire Valley! They have taken over my vineyard and are burning it to the ground! TO THE GROUND! Please, George, that vineyard is all I have. Take my fire extinguisher and extinguish the flames at the vineyard. There still might be hope for that land! 
Report to Fiona on the east bank of the Thondroril River in the Eastern Plaguelands.	Warchief's Command: Eastern Plaguelands!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Fiona on the east bank of the Thondroril River. The Argent Crusade has reinforced its presence in the Plaguelands and it needs your help to consolidate its victories. Cross the Thondroril River at the eastern border of the Western Plaguelands and look for Fiona on the far bank. Destiny calls! 
Obtain 9 piles of Obsidian-Flecked Mud.	Mud Hunter	Hope you're not afraid of getting dirty. Judging by the looks of you, that won't be a problem. To the north, at the lava's edge, you'll find piles of dark mud. I need it. It'd be best if you didn't ask questions, and focused your efforts on following orders, George. 
Speak with Dispatch Commander Ruag at Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows.	To Stonard	Regardless of whether you assist me within the temple, your people must be told of what is brewing here. Southwest of the temple is the Horde town of Stonard. The orcs there wage war with the new human arrivals to the swamp, a raging conflict that I foresee only worsening. It is not my role to interfere in mortal affairs, George. I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple. 
Obtain an Icon of Tsul'kalu, an Icon of Mahamba, and an Icon of Pogeyan from Bloodscalp trolls in the Tkashi Ruins.	Sacred to the Bloodscalp	Ahh... these must be names of their totemic creatures - the animals that they attribute to the spirits. Let's see... Mahamba as water, Tsul'Kalu as earth, Pogeyan as... air? Fire? I can't make this part out. I'd like some more information on these spirits of theirs. The Bloodscalp have a camp close to here, in the Tkashi ruins. Maybe you can find some details there. 
Kill Captain Iceheart and 12 Stormpike Soldiers.	Decimation	<Melisara's image appears before you.>The Stormpike forward camp sits atop Corrahn's Dagger, west of Sofera's Naze. You must enter the camp and slaughter every dwarf that you see. They must be taught what it means to fear and there is no finer lesson than absolute decimation. No survivors, George. Even their captain - especially their captain - must die. I will be in contact. 
Obtain 5 Forgotten Dwarven Artifacts.	Dwarven Artifacts	George, my <boy/beautiful flower>! Are you into archaeology? We've an exciting opportunity right outside our front door. All the shaking from today's seismic event has knocked a number of artifacts loose from the soil around our encampment. Survey along the valley's northern border, and you should find all sorts of treasures. Bring some back to me, and perhaps we can study them together. Right, then! Off you go! 
Bring the Luminescent Pearl to Earthmender Duarn in Silvertide Hollow.	A Pearl of Wisdom	This pearl is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It radiates light, and if you are not mistaken, it radiates powerful magic as well. Earthmender Duarn back in Silver Tide Hollow will surely be interested in this. 
Speak with Legionnaire Nazgrim aboard the Immortal Coil.	Bring It On!	It is time, Mechanic. We are as ready as we ever will be! I shall address the Vanguard, and then we shall swim into the sea to meet our fate. 
Report to Jack Rockleg at Thorium Advance in the Searing Gorge.	Hero's Call: Searing Gorge!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Jack Rockleg at Thorium Advance. SI:7 reports that the Dark Iron dwarves of the Searing Gorge seem to be preparing to attack. Your duty is to learn all you can about their scheming and put a halt to it. You can reach the Searing Gorge by following the road west from the Badlands. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Capture 5 Deeprun Rats by using the Rat Catcher's Flute. Lead the rats back to Monty.	Deeprun Rat Roundup	Avast ye scallywag. Arrrr... Arrrr ye looking fer work? We gots a serious rat problem down here an' not enough hands on the poop deck. What do ye say? All ye needs to do is take this here rat catchin' flute and play the melody around the vermin. They'll follow ye to the ends of the world! Just capture five of the little buggers and bring em back here. We needs em alive. Arrrrr... 
Speak with Billy Maclure.	Lost Necklace	I lost my necklace and I think that guttersnipe Billy Maclure took it! He's usually scuttling like a rat around the Maclure Vineyards east of here. Get my necklace back for me and you'll warm an old widow's heart. 
Plant Ruby Seeds at the corpses of 6 dragonkin within the Vermillion Redoubt.	Life from Death	Human, I have a task for you. Take these ruby seeds and plant them at the corpses of any dragonkin that you come across. Twilight or Vermillion, whelping or dragon, it matters not. We need to see that their bodies are returned to the earth so that life can continue to flourish. In death, there should always be new life. This may be our one consolation during times of war and great tragedy. 
Take the Invisibility Liquor to Maybell Maclure.	The Escape	Take this invisibility liquor to young Maybell. It should last long enough for her to visit Tommy Joe. 
Collect 5 Scalding Shrooms.	Scalding Shrooms	We think that we have a use for the merciless ones that your friend from the cave delivered to us. But I need a preservative for it. Down below in the Scalding Chasm are some mushrooms with the properties that I need. Bring some back up to me and I'll see what I can do. 
Accompany Lady Sylvanas Windrunner to the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest.	Lordaeron	Ride with me to the Sepulcher, George. There are many things I wish to discuss with you. It is imperative that you understand the history of Lordaeron and the plight of the Forsaken. 
Slay 12 Twilight's Hammer cultists, either Depths Overseer or Twilight Miners, within the Elementium Depths.	While We're Here	You know, while we're here, we might as well take care of the Twilight's Hammer intruders. This place used to be ours, after all! I'd help, but with my totems and weapons broken, I'm pretty helpless. 
Get in the arena at the Crucible of Carnage and defeat the Cadaver Collage!	The Crucible of Carnage: Calder's Creation!	Grim and gory, this next match is sure to have the crowd groanin' one way or another. Calder Gray has been gathering the bodyparts of defeated challengers and building the perfect champion. This thing is the ultimate cobbled collaboration of corpsified combatants. A magnificent mashup of mangled monstrosities. Are you ready to get messy?! Cause I am! Let me know when you're ready so we can get this thing started! 
Report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold in Blasted Lands.	Call of the Warmatron	Our venerable warmatron, Okrilla, has sent me to the far reaches of the world in search of suitable heroes that would join our cause. Are you interested in strengthening the Horde's grasp over the Eastern Kingdoms? Then take this portal to the Blasted Lands and report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold! 
Hunt 5 Shadowmaw Panthers.	Panther Prowess	Now the hard part. As panthers grow older, they become more wily, blending in with their environment and becoming difficult to spot. These cunning panthers are known by the name ""shadowmaw"", for their tendency to suddenly appear out of the darkness... with a waiting mouth full of teeth. If you want to prove yourself as a true panther hunter, shadowmaws are the only way to do so. They prowl to the southeast, across the river. 
Find ""Sam"" at the western end of Silver Tide Trench.	The Great Sambino	If you're heading down the trench, I'd like you to check in one of our novice members for me. His name is Sam, but he's likely to embellish it a bit. He doesn't really understand how members of the Earthen Ring work, but he tries hard, so we try to give him the benefit of the doubt. Don't get too wrapped up in helping him with his crazy schemes. Just make sure he's still in one piece and let me know so that I can have a little peace of mind. 
Kill 20 Kvaldir on the Vrykul Ledge. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	No Trespass Forgiven	I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times. I would advise against such kindnesses this day. The Kvaldir are proud, and they will strike back if we do not cripple them completely. Kill all that you find. Sadly, I have the inglorious task of making sure none return to the city, so you can go have all of the fun. I will cheer you on though, of course. 
Slay Warchief Mor'ghor in Dragonmaw Port. You can still recruit Dragonmaw Merchants and Workers to help you.	Death to Mor'ghor	The time has come. Mor'ghor dies today. Be warned, Mechanic. Demon blood courses through his wretched veins, and he channels unnatural power. He will be destroyed, yes. But it will not be an easy fight. You remember where Mor'ghor resides, at the top of the camp. I will meet you there. Finish him! Be sure to recruit 3 Dragonmaw followers if you are short - you will need our help. 
Obtain 6 Wild Black Dragon Eggs.	First Sample: Wild Eggs	I am experimenting with black dragons. Specifically, I am interested in how they procreate. My current experiments require plenty of black dragon eggs, which is why I am here in Lethlor Ravine. I'd gather the eggs myself, but I think you'll benefit from helping me out. You will find them along the edges of the ravine. Beware the guardians that circle above - they do not appreciate stolen eggs. 
Collect 6 Merciless Heads.	Those Aren't Masks	George, there are demon squids out there that are eating gilblins' heads and then taking them over! They better not come in here! Think you could swim out northwest onto Deepfin Ridge or into the Sira'kess Front and bring me back some of those Merciless things? Preferably dead, I think. 
Find Wavespeaker Valoren in the Nightmare Depths of Vashj'ir.	The Wavespeaker	One of the Earthen Ring, Wavespeaker Valoren, swam down into the Nightmare Depths to the northeast. We haven't heard from her in awhile. Swim out there and see if you can find her. 
Interrogate the Captured Wyrmtongue in the structure just north of the tower in Deadwind Pass.	Thought Collection	While I examine these samples further, I ask that you seek out one of our patrols in the structure to the north. It appears they've captured one of the demons. Go, interrogate it. Find out anything you can. And hurry! I'm afraid time is no longer an ally. 
Recover 5 Sea Dog Crates. Speak with Admiral Hatchet to get another Orc Sea Pup if you unexpectedly lose yours.	Steel Thunder	We may not have to live down the shame of this defeat, George. The Warchief will likely have us all executed instead. I'll be damned if we don't go down without a fight. Although the whole beachhead is overrun by Bloodfang worgen, there may still be hope. I want you to accompany one of our sea pups to the beachhead, directly west of here, and recover our supplies. Return to me when the pup can carry no more. 
Kill Diseased Black Bears in Western Plaguelands, then loot 20 Plague Tangles that grow near their corpses.	Latent Disease	I need plagued grass for an... an experiment, of sorts. Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance. Some of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however. Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies. It's not optimal, but it'll do. 
Take Keeshan's Riverboat to Camp Everstill in Redridge.	It's Never Over	Those Blackrock orcs are gonna need an army to handle the Bravo Company and you, George. When you're ready to go, meet us at the dock facing Lake Everstill and we'll set off on my riverboat for Camp Everstill on the other side of the lake. See you there, George. 
Collect 6 Zeb'Sora Troll Ears and return them to Ranger Valanna in the Ghostlands.	Dealing with Zeb'Sora	The lieutenant here rushed us into battle with the trolls across the lake instead of scouting the situation first. We were decimated by his stupidity! You hear me Tomathren? You're an idiot! Will you help us, Mechanic? Those trolls still need to be dealt with. I need to stay here and nursemaid him -- I think he's lost his mind. Just head east to the other side of the lake into Zeb'Sora. I want revenge... bring me their ears so that I can fashion a nice necklace! 
Deliver Muckgill's Flipper back to Captain Keyton at the Azurelode Mine in Hillsbrad Foothills.	Muckgill's Flipper or Something...	This looks like Muckgill's flipper or something. Maybe there's somebody that cares that you killed this murloc back at the Azurelode Mine camp. Probably not, but it's worth a shot. Take Muckgill's fin or whatever it might be back to Captain Keyton at the Azurelode Mine in southwestern Hillsbrad. 
Speak to Patch aboard the Skyshredder circling Highbank.	Reprisal	I happen to know some Alliance scum that have somethin' coming to them. And they have something that belongs to us. I've authorized an all out assault on Highbank. Board the Skyshredder and join the assault. Patch will fill you in on the details as you arrive. 
Speak with Priestess Thaalia at Fort Livingston in Northern Stranglethorn.	Priestess Thaalia	Thank you, George. I know you didn't have to save my life. The return of Bloodlord Mandokir is ill news. He was killed inside Zul'Gurub several years ago, and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind. The trolls of Zul'Gurub were attempting to perform a hideous, horrible ritual. If Mandokir is alive, then it stands to reason that he is not the only one. The explorers at Fort Livingston, far to the south, may know more. Speak with their priestess. 
Kill 10 Stormpike Engineers.	Domination	<Melisara's thoughts intermingle with your thoughts.>The last task will be an assault against the siege technicians of Gavin's Naze, located west of the Headland. Venture to the final finger and lay waste to the dwarf and gnome engineers that build and fortify the Stormpike machines of war. Be sure to plant Cromush's final pocket-nuke as well. 
Kill 4 Brinescale Serpents at Gorrok's Lament.	Ophidophobia	If there's one thing I can't stand, it's snakes. Any kind of snake - doesn't matter. While I was out searching for salvage, I saw a nest of sea serpents surrounding the nearby wreckage. I simply can't relax knowing that those awful creatures could slither up in here at any moment. Please, Mechanic! Do something about them! 
Retrieve the Crucible of Nazsharin. This task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.	Stolen Property	Our revered lady has sent me to aid you in your task. She wants you to retrieve the stolen Crucible of Nazsharin and bring it back here as soon as you can. She grows impatient to start the ritual of summoning so that we might fully begin our preparations for war. 
Slay 15 Andorhal Defenders.	Supporting the Troops	While it is true that these farmers threaten to overrun us, we still cannot forget about the Alliance's main forces. Travel west into Andorhal and slay the human soldiers that are fighting with our deathguards. We need all the help we can get. 
Collect 6 Elementium Shards.	A Little on the Side	You know, it's our moral obligation to save all of this Elementium from the shale spiders. Those creepy things eat the stuff! What a waste! So, what do you say? 90/10 my way? 
Report to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.	Warchief's Command: Ghostlands!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands. Your help is needed to turn back the numberless Scourge invaders and secure the help of the Forsaken in fighting our common enemy. To reach Tranquillien, follow the road south from Fairbreeze Square and into the Ghostlands. Destiny calls! 
Accuse 9 Bloodsail Corsairs of mutiny, then kill them.	Making Mutiny	Before returning to Booty Bay, you should do everything you can to weaken the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Unfortunately, even as captain, you're prohibited from killing other buccaneers in cold blood. Only a Fleet Master can do that. You can, however, put mutineers to the sword... and mutiny can be awfully hard to disprove. Speaking of which, those Bloodsail corsairs that hang out on the lowest level of the ships have been acting awfully suspicious... 
Report to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe in Arathi Highlands.	Hero's Call: Arathi Highlands!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe. Ancient Stromgarde's honor must be redeemed! Too long have ogres and criminals sullied its streets. Travel north from the Wetlands and cross the Thandol Span to reach Arathi. Follow the road to Refuge Pointe and present yourself to the captain. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Pass through Zanzil's Portal. If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with Maywiki at the Explorers' League Digsite.	Plunging Into Zul'Gurub	Zanzil the Outcast has once again escaped through one of his portals. Follow him! 
Collect 8 Disarmed Land Mines from the Sorrowmurk to the east of Bogpaddle.	Mostly Harmless	Here's another favor you can do for me, pal. We had a whole shipment of Landmines come in from Booty Bay just the other day. But someone stole the whole lot of 'em in the night! Whoever it was must be sloppy, because they dropped them all over the swamp to the east. No goblin I know would be that careless. I need you to go gather those landmines up for me. I'm sure they're perfectly safe and disarmed. Every single one. Yup. 
Speak to Warlord Zaela at Crushblow.	Crushblow	You've more than proved your intent and your abilities. With Grim Batol cut off and the black dragons routed, the Twilight's Hammer are cornered in their Citadel. Go to your leaders. You should find them west, at Crushblow. Let them know that when the attack on the Twilight Citadel begins, the red flight shall fill the skies above. You may not be able to atone for all of the sins your allies have committed, but in this one battle, we shall be by your side. The Twilight's Hammer will fall. 
Defeat Jammal'an the Prophet.	Step Three: Prophet	All that yet stands between me and the temple is Prophet Jammal'an himself. He is the leader of the Atal'ai trolls here, a foul manipulator. Know that you do not face a mere crazed troll, George, but an instrument of forces beyond your darkest comprehension. Yet you do not fight alone; my strength and the will of the Green Dragonflight go with you. Proceed to the Den of the Caller, left through the Hall of Ritual, and then down into the Hall of Bones. At the bottom, you will find Jammal'an. 
Recover 250 Blight Samples.	Studies in Lethality	We used a fairly potent strain of blight against the humans of Southshore. As you can see, it worked. The trouble with blight use, though, is that blight tends to stick around after it's served its purpose. What I need from you is to take this testing kit and get out into the field to get a lethality count from the blight slimes that we've released into the area. Use the lethality analyzer on the blight slimes sweeping the slime pools. Come back to me when you have some solid data. 
Seek out Felora Firewreath in Silver Tide Hollow.	Silver Tide Hollow	Most of the other Earthen Ring that escaped the massacre on the boats have taken shelter in a cave a short swim down from the ridge. It's tucked midway up a huge rock formation, west of Nespirah, the gigantic shell on the horizon. I need you to make sure they're okay. There's no telling how many naga might have attacked them as well. I'm going to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. I'll send word if I find the rock he's hiding under. 
Locate Mary and persuade her to give up a reflective surface for Viktori's project.	Look To The Stars	My gnomish friend, Cog, has promised to help me build a device which will let me peer towards the stars. According to Cog's blueprint, what I need first is a way to reflect light. I remember a woman by the name of Mary who became well known around these parts for always carrying a looking glass. Perhaps you can track Mary down and see if she might lend us a reflective surface for this project? I believe she once resided in southern Duskwood... 
Rescue Krennan Aranas.	Save Krennan Aranas	All these years after the war and Crowley was still hiding enough firepower in that cellar to level half of the district. It might have to come to that, unfortunately. We can't open fire just yet, there is a civilian trapped on the other side of the prison. Not just any civilian, either. Krennan Aranas is one of the most brilliant alchemists this world has known. One of his potions saved my daughter, Tess, from dying soon after being born. Take my horse and rescue him. Krennan must live. 
You must slay the orca, Blackfin, to retrieve Gilblingle's Map.	Blackfin's Booty	<A torn page precedes the latest entry, which reads:>Our self-proclaimed king will stop at nothing to acquire my family fortune. He has threatened and harassed me to no end. I can't take it anymore! I've buried the treasure and fed the map to Blackfin. That should keep my cousin's grubby little mitts off of our precious heirlooms! 
Report your success to Overseer Oilfist at Thorium Point in Searing Gorge.	The Mountain-Lord's Support	Alright, alright! If I knew ye could dance like that, I wouldn't'a asked ye to do all that stuff earlier. Tell Overseer Oilfist that I'll be joinin' ye. I'll meet ye in the slag pit, <lad/lass>! With the combined forces of Thorium Point and Iron Summit, those gorge-dwarves won't know what hit 'em! 
Retrieve 6 Servitor Cores.	Unyielding Servitors	The magi of Ambermill have employed foul magic to keep us away. Elemental servitors, created with immunities that we cannot breach, protect their territory. Venture east to Ambermill and slay the unyielding elemental servitors that guard the town and recover their cores. Bring their cores back to me so that I may devise a method by which we are able to destroy them all! 
Reconvene with Del Gahrron at the Menders' Stead in Western Plaguelands.	The Long Trip Home	I've been many places in my life, good Mechanic. I fought the battle for Ahn'Qiraj, passed through the Dark Portal into Outland, and joined the Argent Crusade to beat down Scourge in coldest Northrend. But before it all, I was a farmer here in Lordaeron. Now I find myself here in Hearthglen, a scant few miles from home. It's time I paid my respects. I'm headed to the Menders' Stead before I return home. I wouldn't mind meeting up with you again once I get there. 
Obtain the Amulet of Allistarj from the Serpent's Coil in the Blasted Lands.	The Amulet of Allistarj	When my master helped me to take my eyes out, he gave me the gift of sight... a sight much greater than yours, or even of these blood-craving elves. My sight allows me to see objects of demonic power, such as the Amulet of Allistarj. Allistarj himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside the Serpent's Coil, to the east. Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to Razelikh's perch. 
Return the news on Clan Mullan to Iain Firebeard at the Firebeard Cemetery.	The Loyalty of Clan Mullan	Your point's made. Keegan can count on us. We'll meet'm back at town as soon as all the boys are rallied up. You're tough for not bein' a Wildhammer. Guess they breed'm good where you come from too. Still, haven't seen ya drink yet. That'll be the real test. 
Bring Linzi's Gift to Maywiki of Zuldazar at the Explorers' League Digsite.	Maywiki	<Linzi looks troubled.>You know, there's a troll hiding behind that pile of boxes. She must be awfully sad, if she doesn't want to come out and talk to anyone.<Linzi places some of the Akiris reeds in a kerchief and ties it together.>Here, give these to her. They're very soft, and that maybe they will make her feel a little more comfortable back there. 
Speak with Priestess Hu'rala at Bambala in Northern Stranglethorn.	Priestess Hu'rala	Thank you, George. I know you didn't have to save my life, and... well, I am thankful. The return of Bloodlord Mandokir is ill news. He was killed inside Zul'Gurub several years ago, and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind. The trolls of Zul'Gurub were attempting to perform a hideous, horrible ritual. If Mandokir is alive, then it stands to reason that he is not the only one. The trolls at Bambala in the east may know more. Speak with their priestess. 
Speak to King Genn Greymane at Greymane Court in Gilneas City.	Vengeance or Survival	Tell Greymane that we have trackers on Sylvanas and tell him about the Plague. The decision will be his. Launch an all out attack against the leader of the Forsaken or try to evacuate our survivors. 
Save 10 Hill Fawns.	A Fighting Chance	Blessed be the Light! I need your help! On my way into Hillsbrad I noticed several families of adorable little deer. As I went out to pet one of the little fawns a ravenous mountain cat leapt out and killed it. I fled to Tarren Mill and swore to solve the plight of the hill fawn. Now, after many days of tinkering, I have created the hill fawn's salvation! Take my wand into the fields to the west and use it to empower the wee hill fawns. Once empowered they will be able to fend for themselves! 
Find the Lightforged Arch within the Dawning Woods Catacombs.	The Halls of the Dead	<In front of you, the bare earth slopes down towards the dark entrance to the crypts.><You can feel the tug of the lightforged artifact urging you towards it. Perhaps the other piece is down there?> 
Speak with Commander Sharp in Stormwind Harbor.	The Troll Incursion	A group of trolls, claiming to represent the Darkspear tribe, have arrived at Stormwind Harbor. Our guards are keeping them at bay, for now. The Stormwind Harbor Guards are seeking seasoned adventurers for help in removing the trolls from the harbor. Report to Commander Sharp at Stormwind Harbor. 
Collect 8 Succulent Crab Meat from Splitclaw Skitterers.	Traveling on Our Stomachs	I'll need your help if I am to get these orcs ready for battle. Any worthy leader knows that his warriors travel and fight on their stomachs. No food, no victory. These warriors are weary from their struggle out there. They need food before they're ready to overcome a naga attack. Speaking of traveling on stomachs, I saw plenty of crabs out on the sea floor... 
Kill 3 Tentacles of Iso'rath.	Torn Ground	It won't be takin' much convincin' to turn us against da Twilight - dat's already our goal. We've already come to battle here though, so we may be needin' ya help before we can turn towards dere fortress. Da Twilight have already brought Iso'rath up from da ground to the south, I'm sure ya noticed. Its tentacles have been burstin' from da ground all around us. We could use a hand beatin' them down if you be willin'. 
Slay Gorfax Angerfang and 16 Dragonmaw Orcs in the Angerfang Encampment.	The Angerfang Menace	When we hauled up here to get away from the raptors, we put ourselves right next to a whole slew of Dragonmaw orcs! I've heard the stories in Menethil, how the Dragonmaw are even cruder barbarians than other orcs, how they strangle black dragons with their bare hands... I don't know how much of it's true, but I know we can't just let 'em sit up here in the hills. You've got the chops for it, George. Head east to the Angerfang Encampment, take care of those orcs, and make sure you get their leader! 
Locate Thordun Hammerblow, a downed Wildhammer gryphon-rider, at the Twilight Shores in Twilight Highlands.	Bird Down! Bird Down!	While you were fighting along the coast, I spotted a gryphon tumble out of the clouds almost due west of here. It wasn't one of ours. Likely it belonged to one of the Wildhammer. I know that Kurdran wanted to establish contact with the lost Wildhammer clans as one of his primary objectives after taking the beach. I can't spare any more of my men to scout it out, but I can spare you. Find that downed Wildhammer! 
Speak with Earthcaller Yevaa at the Elementium Depths in the Twilight Highlands.	Help from the Earthcaller	My investigation into Cho'gall's artifact has hit a dead end. The Twilight's Hammer enslaved a group of Wildhammer smiths and then drowned them in the lake when they were done with their services.<Garona spits.>I hate to say it, but we need help. There's an Earthen Ring woman, a draenei named Earthcaller Yevaa. She and her pet goblin are southwest at the Elementium mine. They need help with shutting down the elemental portals around here. In exchange, she can help us with our problem. 
Use Enohar's Explosive Arrows to slay 20 Darktail Bonepickers in the Shattershore.	Curtail the Darktail	The other thing that concerns me about those shipwrecks is all the vultures that they've attracted. Knowing how those birds operate, they've already picked the bones clean, but still... we can't allow them to further desecrate the bodies of our friends. Before I brewed, I hunted. Here, take this bow, and more importantly, these arrows. They've been laced with a little concoction that should give those bonepickers a surprise. 
Kill 8 Boulderfist Ogres and 10 Boulderfist Enforcers.	Clearing the Highlands	No threat here will go overlooked. If we are to secure these lands under the Dark Lady's rule, we will tear from them everything living, inch by inch, piece by piece. To the northeast, not a stone's throw away from this camp is an ogre mound. The Boulderfist ogres that dwell in it must be eradicated, Mechanic. They are in the way. Show no mercy or hesitation. 
Enter Uther's Tomb, and use the Chillwind Tribute before his statue.	Uther's Blessing	These farmers from the south wish to take these farms, but I can't let them enter the plaguelands unprepared. Even with the Scourge gone, danger still looms in the form of the Forsaken. No, we must be ready to fight... and that includes our new visitors. Before doing anything else, however, I would recommend that you travel to Uther's Tomb, to the east, and place this tribute before his statue to ask for his blessing. Speak with the priest that tends to the tomb when you are finished. 
When you are ready to part with Vex'tul, throw Warlord Thresh'jin's body into the bonfire atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat.	Into the Flames	This is the last time you will see me, George. I am leaving the caravan. If you want to continue fighting by my side, hang on to Thresh'jin's body. I can wait for a while longer. When you are ready to say goodbye, throw the body into the bonfire atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat. Thank you for your companionship, George. You were strong. 
Use the Mother's Flame on Obsidian Eggs to release whelps. Follow those hatchlings to the lair of their mother.	Following the Young Home	In the southwestern portion of the Obsidian Forest, you will find some of the black egg clutches. Many of the eggs can be hatched at any time with a bit of prodding from the right flame, and as the whelplings hatch, they will cry out and flock for their mother. Do not worry, if this purging is to be taken to the whelps, that is not a task that I will force on you. I simply want you to let them out and follow them home as they seek their mother. It is she who we must confront. 
Find Deathstalker Commander Belmont at Emberstone Village in the Ruins of Gilneas.	Fall Back!	<The F.C.D. buzzes.><Howls can be heard in the background.>George, do you read me? Come in, George. This is likely my final transmission. The worgen have overrun Forsaken Forward Command. It is now only a matter of time before the base is lost. Belmont and the val'kyr, Arthura, have left. Belmont mentioned that they will rendezvous with you at Emberstone Village, located to the northeast. Find Belmont, George. Our mission - our very existence - depends on it. You are our final hope. 
Slay 7 Bloodscalp Mystics, 7 Bloodscalp Hunters, 7 Bloodscalp Scouts, and 1 Bloodscalp Beastmaster.	Population Con-Troll	I understand you may be headed to Zul'Kunda soon. While you are there, I have a small task for you. The trolls are outgrowing Stranglethorn. The Bloodscalp in the West, the Skullsplitters in the East... they pour out of their ruins and into the jungle, disrupting the natural balance of the region. It is time we restored that balance. Zul'Kunda is the Bloodscalp capital. Inside you will find the most high-ranking Bloodscalps. Reduce their numbers, then return to me. 
Bring an Elder Crocolisk Skin to Drizzlik at Nesingwary's Expedition.	Excelsior	With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line. It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder snapjaw crocolisk. Find them to the south, near the border with the cape. 
Bring Bwemba to the remains of Mauti.	Mauti	I got da feeling dat somethin' ain't right wit' dat panther, George. It ain't natural. I gonna need to perform some rituals over da body. Put Mauti down, an' den let's see what we can find out, George. 
Investigate the 4 intact statues in the Vashj'ir Gardens.	An Occupation of Time	Look--George is it?--I need your help. I know most everyone in this cave thinks that we're not in a position to be worrying about anything but our own hides right now, but I cannot dismiss my ancestors so readily. This was one of the royal cities of the elves in the days when Azshara was queen. In this city lie the keys to lore long lost and artifacts of unimaginable historical value. All I want from you, while you're out in the city proper, is to keep a watchful eye out for objects of significance. 
Gather 5 pieces of Stormwind S.E.A.L. Equipment.	Finders, Keepers	I recognize this helm, Human. You were wise to bring it to me. The Alliance have a special unit, trained and equipped to explore and fight beneath the sea. It would seem that they are in this region to do more than just defend against our attack. There must be more of these down here, and if you can find them it could turn things around for the Vanguard. 
	Lunk Like Your Style	 
Kill 8 of any Eel in the Kelp Forest.	Once More, With Eeling	Eels are among the creepiest of Azeroth's creatures. Sure, there are those who pretend that they don't mind them - and others who actually claim to favor them. They are lying. Truth be told, no one likes eels. Eels don't even like eels. Azeroth would be a better place if no one ever had to envision an eel slithering out from the murky depths and biting them. In the face. 
Obtain 5 Mysterious Pearls from Idra'kess Warlords and Idra'kess Prophets inside of Nespirah.	Still Valuable	My time in the pearl pits, however short, has made me curious about the naga's goals. Yes, I now know that the naga want to use Nespirah as an engine of war, but if that's the case, then why are they enslaving men to mine her pearls? Assuming we escape this creature's hull, I would very much like to study these objects. The pearls we found in the pits were much too large to carry, but I've seen the warlords and prophets occasionally carrying around smaller ones. 
Obtain 4 Marrowpetals, 4 Xavren's Thorns, and 8 Briny Sea Cucumbers.	Variety is the Spice of Death	These pumpkins have a purpose, Mechanic. They'll be the delivery mechanism for my latest batch of plague, which should be a particularly painful and virulent concoction. However, the plague requires a few rare ingredients. We'll need Marrowpetals, which grow at the bottom of Stillwater Pond, just to the east of here. We'll also need Xavren's thorn, which grows on rocky cliffs to the northwest. Finally, we need some briny sea cucumbers, found in the surf off of Whispering Shore. 
Find Brubaker.	Point of Contact: Brubaker	Before we do a damned thing we need to get a field kit together. You'll help with that, George. There's also a matter of scouting. Thankfully for that we got some help from Stormwind. An old war buddy of mine, Brubaker, was sent here by SI:7 to scout around for us. You're to meet him in the field, just south of here. Meet up with Brubaker and find out what he knows. 
Magister Kaendris, at the Sanctum of the Sun, wants you to talk to Ranger Vynna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.	The Farstrider Enclave	Magisters and Farstriders may not see eye to eye all the time, George. When it comes to Dar'Khan, however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions. Ranger Vynna, at the Farstrider Enclave northeast of here, has come across important information regarding our enemy. Speak to her and see if you can be of assistance. 
Use your Death Cultist Disguise to enter the Death Cultist Base Camp, then put Betina's mixture into the Mereldar Plague Cauldron.	Just a Drop in the Bucket	Now, mix a tiny amount of rot into the water, and mix thoroughly. There, that's it. This solution will still be very powerful, and we only need a little bit of it. On the lake's southeastern border, you will find a plague cauldron with several cultists nearby. Put on your cultist disguise, then approach the cauldron and put in ONE DROP of the solution you made. No more, or you may risk your very life! 
Report to your Captain's Chambers within the Damsel's Luck in the Cape of Stranglethorn.	The Damsel's Luck	I know ye just arrived here on the Crimson Veil, but I need to send ye off on another task. The Damsel's Luck is the third ship in me fleet, moored over to the east. Her skipper - Captain Stillwater - is no longer with us. Damn those masked hoodlums! Anyhow, Ironpatch told me about yer heroics at sea, and I be runnin' low on quality brigands. I think yer more than capable for this new duty. Congratulations, matey. Ye be the new captain of the Damsel's Luck. 
Find Tarenar Sunstrike within the Plaguewood in Eastern Plaguelands.	Blind Fury	Tarenar wasn't joking when he said that he didn't care about judgment and caution. He nearly took off that high elf's head as he ran into the Plaguewood, looking for Gidwin. You should go after him. The Plaguewood is a big place, George. Good luck. I hope to see you <boys/three> come out of the woods in one piece. 
Bring Highbeacon's Parcel to Argent Apothecary Judkins at Plaguewood Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.	The Plaguewood Tower	With the recent, unfortunate developments involving Gidwin, it might not be wise for a man my age to take the dangerous trip through the Plaguewood. This is fine - I can visit the Plaguewood Tower on my next trip around the loop. I do, however, have a delivery that I need to get to Judkins. You are younger than I, and stronger in combat. Will you take this delivery to him? 
Deliver the Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment to Bloodlord Mandokir in Grom'gol Base Camp.	Bloodlord Mandokir	Human. Human, Human, Human... you didn't think I was a friend, did you, Human? Ah, ha ha haaaa! You've served your purpose. I've returned to the realm of the living, and it's all thanks to you. So, instead of killing you, I'm going to make you a deal instead. Give me the raptor. You must already know that she's no normal raptor, and I need a replacement for Ohgan. Do it, or both you and the witch doctor will taste my rage. 
Return the Ghost Hair Comb to Madame Eva in Darkshire.	Return the Comb	NO!!!!!Take it, take this comb away from me! I'm a monster, and no one will ever think me lovely again! 
Slay 6 Rockjaw Invaders.	Hold the Line!	Hey, you there! Ye're a stout-looking Mechanic. Lend us a hand? It looks like today's big earthquake shook a bunch o' those barbarous troggs out of the ground, and they're sure steamed about something. My men are doing what they can to hold them off, but we could use a hand. Do yer part - head just south of here and help dig me mountaineers outta trouble. We've got to hold the line! 
Obtain a Coldridge Beer Flagon, a Ragged Wolf-Hide Cloak, and some Leftover Boar Meat.	Pack Your Bags	The weight limit on my gyro is such that I only have enough room for one Human. Looks like you're in luck, George! That dwarf woman Jona told me that most of your personal belongings have been moved inside Anvilmar. Please gather what you'll need, finish up any affairs that remain, and return to me when you're prepared for takeoff. 
Head to the Explorers' League Digsite in Southern Stranglethorn Vale.	To the Digsite	The other Darkspear emissary was here briefly. He was eager to get to the next location and warn them. I sent him on a flight to the Explorers' League Digsite in the Cape of Stranglethorn. I hope he wasn't too late. I will give you use of one of my gryphons, a direct flight there. Talk to me when you are ready to go, George. 
Ride with Lord Darius Crowley and round up 30 Bloodfang Stalkers.	Sacrifices	You don't have to do this, George. You've done more than enough already. But if you decide to stay... I'd be a fool to turn you away. My men have fortified their position inside the cathedral and are ready for what comes next. I'm about to head there and take as many of these flea-ridden devils with me as I can. You're welcome to come along for the ride. 
Kill 12 Rampaging Owlbeasts.	Extinction	Owlbeasts... Soulless, feathered monstrosities sent from the darkest depths of the Twisting Nether to prey upon the weak.<Nils points to the woods surrounding Eastpoint Tower.>They surround us on all sides and they are planning an attack - I can sense it. You must stop them before they can organize. I want you to head into the forest and kill every owlbeast that you see. NONE SHOULD SURVIVE! 
Erunak Stonespeaker wants you to slay Warden Azjakir at The Clutch.	The Warden's Time	<Erunak's image penetrates your mind.>You have done well, George, but more remains to be done. Before moving on from this place, let us be sure that we leave it in disarray. Find the one who leads these naga and repay him for his misdeeds. 
Speak with Jack Rockleg at Thorium Advance in Searing Gorge.	To the Aid of the Thorium Brotherhood	Dark Iron dwarves may be scheming and mischievous... but they're not all enemies. I've spoken several times with the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood, and they've never been anything but helpful. An acquaintance of mine, Jack Rockleg, came to town not long ago, asking if I could join him on an expedition of some sort. It sounded important. I'm a little busy, but maybe you wouldn't mind going? Just travel west, on the road to Searing Gorge. You'll see him soon after leaving the Badlands. 
Obtain an Annihilator Servo and deliver it to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	WANTED: Annihilator Servo!	WANTED: 1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer. You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares. They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about. Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52. 
Mordenai at Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to feed 8 Mature Netherwing Drakes.	Kindness	Something has them spooked, Human.<Mordenai points to the nether drakes flying overhead.>They won't even come down to feed. I have seen several fall to the earth, dead from exhaustion before their bodies hit the ground. We must save them! The Rocknail flayers that are found near the crystals are their natural prey. Kill flayers and take their carcasses. Place a carcass in the field and stand extremely still. As long as you do not make any aggressive motions, they will not attack you. 
Slay Netherock and then report in with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Breaking Down Netherock	To whomever cares about the timely construction of the X-52 Nether-Rocket --The king of the local mountain giants, Netherock, has been terrorizing the Crumbling Wastes. He's been interfering with operations all along the south ledge of the island! Take your friends and deal with him! Then, return to me here in Area 52. Rocket-Chief Fuselage 
Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the Mo'arg at Forge Base: Gehenna and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the forge camp.	Teleport This!	As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill. Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy... but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do. Take this rod... I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies. Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see. You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters. 
Use the Cipher of Damnation at the Altar of Damnation to summon Cyrukh the Firelord. Destroy Cyrukh the Firelord and then speak with Earthmender Torlok, also found at the Altar of Damnation.	The Cipher of Damnation	How many times has this spell has been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled. What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read from it at the Altar of Damnation - where the memory of Gul'dan stands. What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of Cyrukh. You must be victorious, George. This land can not withstand another shattering. 
Travel through the Dark Portal and find Commander Duron. He awaits your arrival on the other side - in the Outland.	Burning Crusade: Through the Dark Portal	For 20 years the Dark Portal has remained a silent monument - a eulogy to a time long since forgotten.<Relthorn looks around.>I never thought to see this day, yet here we stand, looking into the abyss. On the other side of this gate we are locked in a savage war - a war that we cannot win without support. You must go through the Dark Portal and help our troops, Mechanic. Report to Commander Duron at once. He awaits you in Outland... 
Report to Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52.	Report to Spymaster Thalodien	Some time ago, Voren'thal dispatched a small team to Netherstorm to investigate the activities of Kael'thas. Our leader has the utmost confidence in Spymaster Thalodien and his compatriots, and has decided to honor his request for reinforcements. Thalodien's report was brief, but clear that he's encountered something of great importance. Report to him at Area 52 and assist him in any way possible, George. 
Recover the Heart of the Fel Reaver and deliver it to N.D. Meancamp at The Heap in the Netherstorm.	It's a Fel Reaver, But with Heart	You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south? Isn't it a thing of beauty? I want its heart! What? Yes, of course it has a heart... what doesn't?<N.D. looks indignant for a moment.>Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return. Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you. These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch! Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin. 
Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you slay 30 Minions of Gurok.	Shattering the Veil	<Gordawg breaks off a piece of ebon rock from his back.>You are granted a piece of the fury of the earth. Take the boulder of Gordawg and hurl it at the poison rock. Shatter their shells to discover the truth. Destroy the minions of the usurper and return to Gordawg with the name. You find the shattered elements at the edge of the world. Southwest. 
Enter the Violet Tower at the center of Kirin'Var Village and defeat Ar'kelos, then speak with Archmage Vargoth.	Ar'kelos the Guardian	Now that you've gathered all the items I'll need to break Kael'thas's curse, one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane golem, known as Ar'kelos, at the bottom of the tower. You must defeat Ar'kelos in order allow me to work magic within the tower again. When you enter the Violet Tower, the curse will begin to affect you. Once you have defeated Ar'kelos, ascend the tower and assist me in making preparations for the ritual. 
Deliver the Netherologist's Notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Off To Area 52	I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that. This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town. Isn't this bridge great? If I could just keep this junk working. Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52! It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road. Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage? I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all! 
Locate Battle-Mage Dathric's quarters in Wizard's Row and return the blade to his weapon rack. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.	Battle-Mage Dathric	The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name ""Dathric"" are engraved into the weapon's pommel. Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world? Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last. 
Locate Abjurist Belmara's quarters in Wizard Row and return the book to its Bookshelf. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.	Abjurist Belmara	This worn, sturdy tome is no spellbook, as you might expect a Kirin Tor mage to carry. The pages of the volume are covered with hand-copied stories, accompanied by colorful illustrations. The tome seems to be far older than its former owner and may have even been a family heirloom. A powerful tie to the book may have been the last thread tying Belmara's spirit to the ruins of Kirin'Var. Returning it to its proper place on the bookshelf in her quarters might help appease her restless spirit. 
Locate Conjurer Luminrath's quarters in Wizard Row and return the mantle to his Dresser. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.	Conjurer Luminrath	The cloak, undoubtedly of high elven craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties. Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest. 
Locate Cohlien Frostweaver's quarters in Wizard Row and return the hat to his Footlocker. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.	Cohlien Frostweaver	Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it. You try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance. The treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit. 
Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill 10 Sunfury Archers.	The Sunfury Garrison	After Prince Kael'thas's forces destroyed the village and imprisoned the archmage in the Violet Tower, they withdrew to Sunfury Hold to the northeast. The very men who destroyed our village and slew our fellows toast their 'amazing victory' while we are helpless to avenge the fallen. We must not allow these crimes to go unanswered! Be the instrument of our vengeance, George. Go to Sunfury Hold and claim the lives of those responsible for this crime. 
Retrieve 12 Ravager Eggs for Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash in Hellfire Peninsula.	Ravager Egg Roundup	I'm starving! There's irony in that, wouldn't you say? A starving cook?<Legassi laughs half-heartedly and taps a folded piece of parchment he has in his pocket.>According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near Terokkar Forest. It's called the Razorthorn Trail, and supposedly it's brimming with delicious ravager eggs! I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some! 
Follow Khadgar's servant and listen to its story. Return to Khadgar after completing this task.	City of Light	Do not burden A'dal with petty inquisitions, Mechanic. That just might be the most powerful being you ever come face to face with. You do not look familiar. I suppose you want to learn about the city? You'll have to excuse me if I don't give you a tour myself, but I'm a bit busy discussing strategy with A'dal. Perhaps you'll find a summoned servant acceptable in my stead? Excellent! 
Slay 10 Overmine Flayers and Barash the Den Mother. Return to Overlord Mor'ghor at the Dragonmaw Base Camp should you succeed.	A Job Unfinished...	In the name of our great master... For the glory of Illidan! By order of Overlord Mor'ghor, the great plateau of Netherwing Ledge is to be secured. With all Netherwing drakes captured or forced off of the land, rock flayers are running rampant and threatening crystal harvesting operations. Destroy them all, their den mother and her consort, Arvoar. Mor'ghor commands it!<It would appear that this orc failed to take the plateau. It is time to prove your worth to Mor'ghor!> 
Matron Varah has given you a list of ingredients for the making of her two favorite dishes, which includes the collection of 3 Raptor Ribs and 3 Serpent Flesh. Bring them to her at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Mok'Nathal Treats	Hungry, Human? The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves. If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because Braagor there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty! The raptors and scalewings of Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste. Bring me their raptor ribs and serpent flesh, and I'll make some of each for you. I may even teach you how to cook them up for yourself, if you hurry. 
Defeat Brokentoe. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: Brokentoe	So are you ready for your first battle? If you are, let me know and I'll get things started. All you have to do is go wait in the Ring of Blood for your opponent to arrive. This fight is against Brokentoe, a ferocious clefthoof. Good luck! I hope you brought friends. And remember, the fight's over when either you or your opponent are lying face down on the arena floor. 
Travel to the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley and speak to Akama.	The Secret Compromised	Thanks again, George. I recognize your name. Akama has entrusted you with his plans and so I will trust you as well. The naga discovered I was working against Illidan and tried to get me to speak by torturing me. I did not tell them a thing - Akama himself taught me to master pain through meditation. Illidan asked the naga to bring me to him. He would have seen right through my flesh and into my soul's deepest secrets. Akama must be warned. Our plans are in jeopardy! 
Let Karynaku return you to Mordenai in the Netherwing Fields.	Ally of the Netherwing	Allow me to return you to Mordenai. I am certain that he wishes to see you once more. 
Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use Yarzill's Mutton in conjunction with Fel Glands to poison 12 Dragonmaw Peon Camps.	A Slow Death	The Dragonmaw have peons stationed at nearly every crystal formation up here. While the outright slaying of them would draw far too much unwanted attention to you, there is a way that we can thin their numbers and remain below the suspicious eyes of Mor'ghor. Venture into the wilds of Shadowmoon Valley and slay the tainted wildlife. Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill! 
The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Armor.	Divination: Gorefiend's Armor	In life, Gorefiend was a bastard, but in death, Gorefiend was an unmitigated terror. To the southeast you will find Netherwing Ledge. What was once part of the mainland of Shadowmoon is now a floating island in the sky. Vhel'kur, spawn of Deathwing, once called it his home, but now knows it as his grave. He flies an endless circle above the island, seething at his defeat to Gorefiend. If you are to recover the Gorefiend's armor, it is Vhel'kur that you must defeat. 
Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri. Completing quests with the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Tablets of Baa'ri	The Ashtongue Broken have been ordered by Illidan to excavate the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the far north. They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion. We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple. 
Illidari Lord Balthas at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 2 Felsteel Bars, 1 Adamantite Frame, 1 Khorium Power Core and 1 Flawless Arcane Essence.	The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron	Reth'hedron now lords over the Twilight Ridge of Nagrand. An eredar of such power being loosed upon this world does not bode well for the Illidari. Alas, we do not have the resources required to slay Reth'hedron. Not with the war the bastards have brought to the Black Temple. No... I have a better plan. You will subdue Reth'hedron, banishing him back through the Twilight Portal. For this a soul cannon must be fashioned. Return to me with the materials on this list. 
Seek out Neltharaku, patron of the Netherwing Dragonflight.	Seek Out Neltharaku	Their patron soars high above, George. Perhaps the kindness that you showed his children has moved his heart. Seek Neltharaku out and enlist his aid. Together, you may be able to solve the plight of the Netherwing drakes.<Mordenai points to the sky.>Fly high, friend... 
Kill Warp-Raider Nesaad and then return to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Warp-Raider Nesaad	Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with! I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there. Go back and take out Nesaad. He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap. Don't fail like I did, Mechanic. 
Speak to Greatmother Geyah and tell her what Garrosh told you.	There Is No Hope	You are an honorable Human, George. You have done much for the Mag'har. No one could ever deny your service to my people. Alas, the time of the Mag'har is at an end. You have shown me, more than anything, that I am unfit to lead these people. My cursed blood runs too deep. I will not... I cannot become the second Hellscream to damn the orcs. Please, George, return to the Greatmother and tell her what I have told you. I am too ashamed to see her... to look into her eyes. 
Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you destroy Gurok the Usurper and bring back Gurok's Earthen Head.	Gurok the Usurper	Gurok must be summoned. You summon Gurok and you destroy. You must go to Warmaul Hill to the northwest and find where ogre worships Gurok. You put ogre skull from Warmaul ogres on Gurok's earthen brand. Only then will Gurok come. Seven skulls. If you live, bring Gordawg back Gurok earthen head. Gordawg crushes head.<Gordawg bites down hard, shaking the earth beneath your feet.> 
Speak to A'dal, the leader of the Sha'tar, in the center of the Terrace of Light.	A'dal	Welcome to Shattrath City, Mechanic. This might be the one place in all of Outland where you'll find any semblance of safety. A group of naaru known as the Sha'tar drove the demons away from here. If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light. The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one. Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land. 
Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover a Netherwing Egg.	The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt	Should you discover any Netherwing eggs while exploring, bring them to me. Be warned, a Netherwing egg is a rare discovery. Do not become frustrated if you cannot locate one. These Dragonmaw have been very thorough in collecting most of them and shipping them off to parts unknown. Eggs might be found on creatures of the island, near crystal formations, in the mines, or even inside a nethercite node or netherdust bush. Keep a low profile. We don't need Mor'ghor catching wind of your actions. 
Use the Demoniac Scryer in Hellfire Basin, wait for it to attune, and then take a reading. Return the Demoniac Scryer and the Demoniac Scryer Reading to Apothecary Antonivich in Thrallmar.	The Demoniac Scryer	The Demoniac Scryer is now ready. Take it behind Hellfire Citadel, to Hellfire Basin, and summon it upon the ground. It will then begin to attune itself to Hellfire Citadel. After its attunement, speak to the Scryer and transcribe what it tells you. Bring that transcription to me...Go, George, but only when you are ready. There is no doubt that Hellfire Citadel will detect the Scryer and send wardens to destroy it! 
	Teron Gorefiend, I am...	With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host.<The ancient shadowmoon spirit's lips curl up to form a wicked grin.>Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever. Teron Gorefiend will be free! 
Travel to the Scalding Pools located near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan and use the Forged Illidari-Bane Blade to quench it in the lava pools. Once you have the Quenched Illidari-Bane Blade, return to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.	Quenching the Blade	The blade is nearly finished! You can almost feel the magic beginning to coalesce inside the steel, but one thing remains to be done. You must take the forged blade to the Scalding Pools near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley and plunge it into the lava pools to quench the sword. When you have quenched the sword, return. 
Chu'a'lor has asked you to return to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have gained Apexis Emanations from an Apexis Relic.	The Relic's Emanation	Now that you have felt the enlightening vibrations of the apexis relics, it is time for you to further your understanding of their workings. We are very eager to benefit from your observations! As you progress in your ability to attune to the relics, you will gain a higher level of knowledge. This recognition will come in the form of an emanation from the relic. Return to us when you have attained such an emanation. 
Recover the Ata'mal Crystal and deliver it to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.	Full Triangle	With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast. Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion! Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along. Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad. 
	More Venom Sacs	 
Tree Warden Chawn has asked you to negotiate with Overseer Nuaar. Return to the tree warden at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains afterward.	A Time for Negotiation...	When we arrived in the Ruuan Weald, the wyrm cultists were keeping themselves to Blackwing Coven, through the tunnel to the west. But now, they are encroaching upon us here. I need you to find the wyrmcultists' overseer. He's known to make a regular patrol between their various camps in the Ruuan Weald. Negotiate with him. Let him know that there's room for compromise, but that we will not condone or allow the wholesale slaughter of the wildlife, nor the felling of all of the trees. 
Illidari Lord Balthas at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley has tasked you with using the Soul Cannon on Reth'hedron the Subduer in Nagrand. You must also return the Soul Cannon.	Subdue the Subduer	<Balthas holds up an alien looking device.>This is a soul cannon. Its effects are devastating when attuned. This one is attuned to my blood. The same blood flowing through the veins of Reth'hedron - my brother. Aye, his misplaced allegiance will be the end of him. Take the cannon and fly to the Twilight Ridge in western Nagrand. Locate Reth'hedron and fire! You must stay on your mount and within range for the effects to take hold. Stand your ground against him and he will have no choice but to flee! 
Bring the Medallion of Karabor to A'dal in Shattrath City.	Akama's Promise	<Akama inserts the crystal into the medallion in his hand.>I am not as strong as I once was, George. Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this. Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side. Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power. Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City. 
Use the Naturalized Ammunition to take control of the Death's Door Fel Cannons. Use them to destroy both the South Warp-Gate and the North Warp-Gate. Then, use the Druid Signal to call out to an Evergrove Druid to report your success.	Fire At Will!	Now that the ammunition can affect the Burning Legion, it's time for you to use it. There are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the void terrors. One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon. Use the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates. Attack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary. 
Defeat Mogor, Hero of the Warmaul. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge	<Gurgthock is counting his massive pile of gold.>You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat Mogor, I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in the Ring of Blood is gonna end up paying off. Now get in there and show these ogres what you're made of! 
Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you Destroy Forge Camp: Hate and Destroy Forge Camp: Fear.	Forge Camp: Annihilated	Gather your allies, George. You will need them if you are to face an overseer. Once you have a suitable group, find and kill the overseers at each camp. Take their keys and use them to turn and fire the fel cannons upon the camps. Return to me once the camps are destroyed. 
Use Rexxar's Battle Horn at the Altar of Goc, then kill Goc. Return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains when this is done.	Showdown	Now it comes to this. We will bring Goc forth from his lair, and we will destroy him. With Goc dead, the Bladespire ogres will threaten the Mok'Nathal no longer. Go to Goc's altar outside Gruul's Lair, then blow my horn. I will come, and we will face the son of Gruul together. 
High Priest Orglum wants you to journey into the Tomb of Lights and defeat 5 Vengeful Draenei.	Vengeful Souls	The Tomb of Lights has become corrupted by the Shadow Council and the draenei dead have become cursed spirits, angry and confused with a burning hatred for the living. Enter the tomb and seek out these tragic victims. Give them the rest that they deserve. 
Follow Captain Skyshatter while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Captain Skyshatter, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter	You dare challenge Skyshatter? The world around you will fall into darkness as the heavens are torn asunder by my meteors. You stand no chance, soldier. Yet it is your desire to die...I will entertain this morbid obsession if only to prove a point to any that might foolishly dream of making the same mistake. We ride when you are ready! 
Seek out Monstrous Kaliri Eggs on the tops of Skettis dwellings and use the Skyguard Blasting Charges on them. Return to Sky Sergeant Doryn.	Fires Over Skettis	You think you have what it takes to be part of the Skyguard? We'll have to see how you handle yerself in the air. The arakkoa are breeding a gargantuan variety of their attack pets and are using it against our scouts. I want you to take these blasting charges and use them to destroy hatcheries above the arakkoa's dwellings. Avoid the monstrous kaliri guarding the hatcheries. They'll knock you off your mount before you know what hit you. 
Report to Lieutenant General Orion at the Stair of Destiny in Hellfire Peninsula. The Thrallmar Mage in the Orgrimmar Portal Room can help you get there.	Warchief's Command: Outland!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Lieutenant General Orion at the Stair of Destiny. Your skills are needed to fight the Burning Legion's presence on the shattered remnants of Outland. Go to the portal room in Orgrimmar's front gate and talk to the Thrallmar Mage to travel to the Blasted Lands, then walk through the Dark Portal to arrive at the Stair of Destiny. Destiny calls! 
Speak to Greatmother Geyah and listen to what she has to tell you.	A Visit With the Greatmother	The Greatmother has asked that I seek you out and deliver a message. She wishes to speak with you at once. My will has been sapped but make no mistake, George, if you anger the Greatmother, I will come down upon you with all the force that I can muster. She is in the main hall.<Garrosh points at the large building to the north.>Listen to what she has to say and do as she tells you. 
	More Basilisk Eyes	 
Deliver the Ata'mal Crystal to A'dal on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.	Special Delivery to Shattrath City	I am an ethereal of my word, George. You have truly inspired me. I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru. As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it. You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to Shattrath City. Simply step through it and you will be transported there. Give the crystal to the naaru known as A'dal on the Terrace of Light. May the trade winds be at your back. 
Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome wants you to place the Oscillating Frequency Scanners in such a way that when you stand amongst them, you are hit by five overlapping Oscillation fields. Return to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	Gauging the Resonant Frequency	Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge. By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals. Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need! Your scanners will even work with those that others drop. Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed! I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst. 
On behalf of the Cenarion Expedition druids of Evergrove, and the indigenous life of the Ruuan Weald, Tree Warden Chawn has asked you to slay Maxnar the Ashmaw. Return to him at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	Maxnar Must Die!	They've left us no choice, George. It's time to put an end to the threat from the Blackwing Coven by taking out their leader, Maxnar the Ashmaw. I don't know if you caught a glimpse of him while you were in there, but he's one of the dragonkin, half-man, half-dragon. And he's tough, so don't underestimate him! Finish it quickly and with any luck you'll secure the safety of Evergrove and the Ruuan Weald. 
	Deathblow to the Legion	When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part. Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them. Take this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you. Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them. May the Light prevail today, George. May Socrethar meet his end. 
Use the Bladespire Banner atop the Northmaul Tower to lure Gurn Grubnosh. Deliver the banner and the Helm of Gurn Grubnosh to Commander Skyshadow at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Planting the Banner	I want you to steal the Bladespire banner from one of their champions and take it south to Bloodmaul Outpost. Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower. This will infuriate the Bloodmaul and they will attack you relentlessly. But it will also keep their hatred focused on Bladespire Hold, and away from Sylvanaar. You will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm. Return it to Sylvanaar. George, this isn't going to be easy. Take a friend or two with you. 
Chu'a'lor has asked you to return to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have gained Apexis Vibrations from an Apexis Relic.	An Apexis Relic	Long ago a now-extinct sect of the arakkoa known as the Apexis lived here. Remnants of their civilization are still present. We call them apexis relics. What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon. Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last. An apexis shard is needed to power the relic. Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration. 
Ensure that Akama and Maiev enter the Black Temple in Shadowmoon Valley after Xi'ri's forces create a distraction.	A Distraction for Akama	<Xi'ri pulses with lights as the Aldor and Scryer forces around him respond to his orders. Xi'ri's army is ready to push Illidan's forces back and create a distraction for Akama. The naaru awaits your request to begin the attack.> 
Take the Time-Lost Offering prepared by Hazzik to the Skull Pile at the center of Skettis and summon and defeat Terokk. Return to Sky Commander Adaris when you've completed this task.	Terokk's Downfall	I... I've turned a blind eye to your dealings with the arakkoa prisoner, George. It looks like your instincts to cooperate with him were right. You must understand... I would've faced a mutiny in my current state if I endorsed your efforts to bring Terokk to this world. Take the items that Hazzik prepared for you and go ahead with your plan. I will command my men to back you up when the time comes. I recommend that you bring a force of your own as well. I fear you'll only get one chance at this. 
Slay Arazzius the Cruel in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in the keep of Honor Hold.	Overlord	The honorable Warp-Scryer has told me of your perils, George - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this 'Arazzius the Cruel' is as powerful and evil as any foe the Sons of Lothar have ever faced. Will you stand for us now, George? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the Light's justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the Pools of Aggonar. If not, his evil will most certainly find you. 
	Blood Oath of the Netherwing	 
Chu'a'lor has tasked you with gathering 5 Apexis Shards. Bring them to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Crystals	When prepared correctly, the crystals of the mountains exhibit strange powers, such as the clarity of mind that we have found here in Ogri'la. All of the creatures atop the mountains covet the crystal shards and use them to further their own goals. An economy has even sprung up around them. To assist us, you must first learn about the Apexis shards. Bring me some. In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals. 
Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to collect 12 Nethervine Crystals from Netherwing Ledge.	To Netherwing Ledge!	I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps. Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs. And George, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island. 
Recover the Draenei Prayer Beads and bring them to Assistant Klatu in Honor Hold.	Digging for Prayer Beads	Anchorite Barada plans to exorcise the corruption from Colonel Jules, and will require an assistant for the task. Such an assistant must be prepared...I am ashamed to admit that my prayer beads were lost in Honor Hold's courtyard. I believe the dog Fei Fei stole them and buried them, but I do not know where. If you speak with his master, Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell, perhaps she will know where Fei Fei hides his stolen treasures. 
Sky Sergeant Vanderlip has tasked you with the bombing of 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. Return to her at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.	Bomb Them Again!	We're still having problems with those flak cannons, George. Don't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out. And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la. What do you say? Want to take another shot at it? 
Bring 12 Plump Buzzard Wings to Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash.	Smooth as Butter	Screed likes to say his flying is as ""smooth as butter."" I think ""butterfingered"" is more like it! Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a ""rough"" landing. Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often! I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs. 
Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.	Bring Down the Warbringer!	We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job. I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him. The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold. After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting. 
Kill Bleeding Hollow Peons for their torches, ignite them at Zeth'Gor's forge then throw the burning torches at Zeth'Gor Buildings.	Zeth'Gor Must Burn!	The Bleeding Hollow clan have betrayed their noble heritage! We, the orcs who fought and died to save ourselves from the fel taint of Mannoroth, look upon our vile cousins and see only weakness and ignobility... and for that, they must burn! Enter Zeth'Gor, their bastion to the east, and burn their buildings. Kill peons for their torches, ignite them at their forge, and hurl the burning torches at their hovels, their stable and their barracks. Burn them all, and then return to me! For the Horde! 
Altruis the Sufferer wants you to obtain Freshly Drawn Blood from a Wrath Priestess at Forge Base: Gehenna in Netherstorm. Spill it on the ground and slay the Avatar of Sathal. Return to Altruis when you've completed this task.	Against the Legion	The Burning Legion has proven its capacity to corrupt mortal souls time and again. If I'm to entrust you with the knowledge you seek, I must have proof of your allegiance. A demoness known as Sathal has eluded me for a long time as she's gifted with an incorporeal form. She watches over the wrath priestesses as they do her bidding at Forge Base: Gehenna. Slay one of her minions and spill her blood on the ground. This affront should cause Sathal to materialize temporarily. Slay her while you can. 
David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge wants you to bring him an Adamantite Frame, 4 Heavy Knothide Leather, and a Demon Warding Totem.	Additional Materials	The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon. Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen. 
Slay any 20 Gordunni Ogres in the Barrier Hills and return to Yuula in Shattrath City.	Threat from Above	So you want to join the Skyguard? Well, I know you can fly... but can you fight? The Skyguard is sworn to protect Shattrath from the dangers that loom above us, both near and far. The Gordunni ogres who dwell in the Barrier Hills to the north are an immediate threat to us. Reaching the ogres has been problematic for Shattrath's ground units. That's where we come in. See what you can do to help contain them. 
Use the Challenge of the Blue Flight to provoke Veraku on the southern edge of the Celestial Ridge. Defeat him and return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.	Securing the Celestial Ridge	The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor. There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission. 
Torkus has asked you to obtain an Unstable Flask of the Beast for him. Return with it to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger	Mechanic, we've got a problem -- we have lots of sons. And ever since the Skyguard moved in nearby, all our sons ever talk about is joining their ranks. As a proud father, we want them to have every advantage for when they apply. So, would you go to the fel crystalforge at either forge camp to the north or south, and procure a magic flask for our sons? You can't miss their green smoke. We think that they take ten apexis shards to make. We'd give you the shards, but we don't have any at the moment. 
Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.	Now That We're Friends...	The naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast have begun to kill our people. We cannot allow this to continue, Mechanic! We suggest that you teach them a lesson as proof of our friendship. 
Slay 10 Marsh Dredgers and 10 Marsh Lurkers, and then return to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Saving the Sporeloks	Ikeyen's been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful! You know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor sporeloks. Ikeyen says that they live there in the Funggor Cavern, but that the marsh beasts have recently invaded. Why don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out? It's just to the southwest. 
Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay Cho'war the Pillager and retrieve the Head of Cho'war.	Cho'war the Pillager	Have you ever seen an ogre king, Human? Few have and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here. The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born. Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head. 
Call down Torgos with Trachela's Carcass. Acquire a Tail Feather of Torgos and return it to Mawg Grimshot at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.	Torgos!	I want Torgos, king of the bonelashers, dead! Not long ago, while I was out hunting at Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes, he fell upon me.<Mawg taps his eyepatch.>He took my eye, and now I would have his life! Bring me one of his tail feathers as proof and I'll give you a worthy reward. You'll need his mate Trachela's carcass though to call him down as he's deathly afraid of the old arakkoan scarecrow known as Torgos's Bane. Find her at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes. 
	Turning Point	This is the chance we've been waiting for, George. Not only have we uncovered the evidence we need to show our people who Kael'thas is really working for, but we can prove our strength by defeating his new masters. My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor, but I will offer you an object that will allow me to project my powers across the continent. 
Look for Ikeyen's Belongings inside a cave south of Umbrafen. Return them to Ikeyen at Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	A Damp, Dark Place	Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village. Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men! I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions. After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after. If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items. What do you say, George? 
Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to speak with Captain Saeed and then follow his army to Manaforge Ultris and kill Dimensius the All-Devouring!	Dimensius the All-Devouring	Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers! Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius. When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you - directly east of here. Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion! I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years! 
	Varedis Must Be Stopped	We must dispose of this foul artifact, but not before we use it to dispose of Varedis's powers. We need to permanently shut down the Ruins of Karabor training grounds, which will mean killing not only Varedis but also the three night elf masters that assist him: Alandien, Theras and Netharel. Gather a suitable force and return to the Ruins of Karabor. Follow Altruis's instructions for defeating Varedis. For all of our sakes, I hope they work. 
Slay Durn the Hungerer. Return to Warden Bullrok if you manage to complete this task.	WANTED: Durn the Hungerer	You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in Nagrand, George. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the Spirit Fields? Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding Oshu'gun, decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious gronn. Gather your allies and venture to the Spirit Fields, far southwest of here, near Oshu'gun, and track down Durn. Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand. 
Use the Kodohide Drum at the Marmot Den. While controlling the Marmot, poison the three kegs in the Bloodmaul Camp. When that is completed, return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Smallest Creatures	The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task. By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands. There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood. Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs. 
Speak with Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Hand of Gul'dan	The elements need your help, Human! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils. The spirits remain tortured to this day. Many are enraged and unwilling to commune with the Earthen Ring. Help this world heal, friend. Southeast of Shadowmoon Village - in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - you will find an area known as the Altar of Damnation. Make your way there and speak with Earthmender Torlok. 
Bring 8 Dreadfang Venom Sacs to Sha'nir in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Strained Supplies	More and more refugees come through the gates of Shattrath City each day. Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here. I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that. Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low. Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes. You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar. 
Extract 5 Elemental Power for Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Elemental Power Extraction	Darn it, that didn't do it! Ok, I've got another idea! I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor. I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it. The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines! The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them. 
Kill Zuluhed the Whacked and recover Zuluhed's Key. Use Zuluhed's Key on Zuluhed's Chains to free Karynaku.	Zuluhed the Whacked	He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break... for me to bend to his will. And this will be his undoing. I will call for him. I will tell him that I will do as he asks. When he appears, kill him and take the key! Know this: Zuluhed is an ancient orc with unknown powers. He has surely been empowered further by Illidan. You risk your life for me in doing as I ask. Are you certain you wish to make such a sacrifice? 
Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to destroy the contents of the Auchenai Coffin.	The Fallen Exarch	They are feeding the souls they steal to a coffin that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts. My scouts believe the contents of the coffin to contain the first exarch of the crypts. They seek to resurrect the ancient one! You must battle your way to the western side of Auchindoun and disturb the contents of that coffin before they feed it enough souls. Should you lose your way, follow the walking souls. Destroy whatever is inside that coffin! 
Escort Earthmender Wilda out of Coilskar Cistern and then seek out Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation, found at the western outskirts of the Hand of Gul'dan.	Escape from Coilskar Cistern	Thank the Earthmother! I parted ways with the others several days ago. I was intent on discovering the source of the disturbance that the spirits of water were feeling. My search led me to Coilskar where I discovered that the naga were befouling the water supply of Shadowmoon Valley. Unfortunately, I was discovered and taken prisoner. There's no telling what ghastly things they had in store for me. We must leave this place! Help me escape and then seek out Torlok at the Altar of Damnation. 
Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to kill 4 Emaciated Felbloods by using the Fel Siphon on them. You will need Demonic Blood from nearby Wrath Heralds to power the Fel Siphon.	Blood for Blood	When Kael's forces retreated through that portal, his most loyal lackeys were rewarded with an abominable gift. They stayed behind and gorged themselves on the blood of demons for days. The blood has changed them, given them new powers. It will also prove their undoing. Obtain blood samples from other demons. Use them to power this fel siphon and deprive these arrogant fools of their new powers. Slay them in their weakened state and return to me. 
Report to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm immediately!	Back to the Chief!	I'm certain that the rocket-chief is going to want to have a word or two with you! If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate to get back to Area 52 and speak with him! 
You must retrieve Vim'gol's Vile Grimoire. Deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Grim(oire) Business	There is one more gronn to be slain: Skulloc Soulgrinder. He keeps himself hidden away, but there is a way to coax him forth. He was trained by an ogre warlock known as Vim'gol the Vile, whose grimoire you must retrieve! Vim'gol must be summoned by yourself, and four others, each standing within a different fire ring at his circle. Find Vim'gol's Circle in the mountains, to the northeast, near the Broken Wilds. And, George, if you hear Vim'gol talk about growing bigger, get back to the fire rings! 
Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand wants you to take the Master Planner's Blueprints to Sal'salabim in Shattrath City and convince him to help you.	Patience and Understanding	Take the blueprints and travel to Shattrath City in the Terokkar forest. Once at Shattrath, go to the Lower City and look for a mo'arg by the name Sal'salabim. He'll probably be at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. By the way, you may need to convince him to lend his assistance. Try to approach him with patience and understanding. If that does not work, use your fists. 
Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to speak to Lump. Return to Huntress Bintook when you have gathered the information that she requested.	Not On My Watch!	The battle plans were written up by an ogre lieutenant. His name is either Dump or Lump.<Bintook turns the parchment sideways and cocks her head.>It could also be Billy. Anyhow, I think you should go back out there and have a word with Billy or Lump or Dumpy or whatever! Try to approach him diplomatically. If that doesn't work, try using some muscle. 
Obtain Doomclaw's Hand and deliver it to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	Declawing Doomclaw	You know what might just discourage them? Take out their leader! It seems to work everywhere else from what I've heard. And when they see a <grizzled/tough> Mechanic, such as yourself take out their leader... why, I bet they'll tuck tail and run for the hills! Get back in there and take out the big one they call Doomclaw. I hear he keeps himself in the eastern part of the Scrap Field underneath the pipe. Bring me his claw, too! Maybe we can make use of it. 
Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him an Ethereum Prisoner I.D. Tag.	Ethereum Secrets	<Ameer holds up a tag.>I found this prisoner I.D. tag with the remains of the fallen vanguard. I can only assume that all of their prisoners are tagged in the same manner. I'm going to start cataloguing the tags in hopes of making sense of their penal system. If in your adventures you find more Ethereum prison keys, you can use them to open the Ethereum prisons at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - directly south of here. Bring me back any and all I.D. tags that you find. 
Mirren Longbeard wants you to bring him 1 Nethergarde Bitter. You must also attain Friendly reputation with Honor Hold to complete this quest.	Gaining Mirren's Trust	So you want to gain our trust? I don't trust many people these days. We lost one of our own not long ago to the arakkoa. It's got me a bit on edge. Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to Honor Hold and... bring me a mug of Nethergarde Bitter... yes, that sounds rather good about now... I'll have a deal to offer you then. Bernie at Nethergarde Keep keeps the bitter in stock. 
The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Truncheon.	Divination: Gorefiend's Truncheon	One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. Gorefiend hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life. But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality! From the corpses of the fallen death knights rose the Ghostriders of Karabor. They now ride the roads encircling the Hand of Guldan, awaiting the day that their master returns. It is they who hold the truncheon of Gorefiend. Retrieve it... 
The Image of Commander Ameer at Bash'ir's Landing in the Blade's Edge Mountains wants you to bring him a Mark of the Nexus-King.	The Mark of the Nexus-King	What I must now know is what the Ethereum have held inside the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun. In your battles against the beasts of the stasis chambers of Bash'ir you may run across an item known as the Mark of the Nexus-King. Should you find such an item, return it to me immediately! It is the final piece in crafting a key that will allow access to the stasis chamber inside the Mana-Tombs. 
Recover the Tear of the Earthmother from Warbringer O'mrogg and return it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.	Tear of the Earthmother	The sword's enchantments must be contained within a powerful focus, such as a gem. I know of a gem that we can use for this purpose, for there are few that can play host to such powerful magics without shattering. The gem we need is called the tear of the earthmother. It's a powerful artifact in the hands of the ogres who created it, and Warbringer O'mrogg, who currently holds the gem, has many powerful allies in Hellfire Citadel's Shattered Halls. Take care in retrieving the tear, George. 
Escort Skywing and report to Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City.	Skywing	Skywing flutters around you. You get the feeling he wants you to follow him. 
Chief Overseer Mudlump at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 10 pieces of Knothide Leather and 1 Hardened Hide of Tyrantus.	Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices	So you're the new overseer, eh? Well there's one thing any good overseer needs and that's the proper disciplinary weapon. Before you can go out there and knock some sense into these peons you need to have your ""piece."" Each overseer has to gather the materials required to make their own ""piece"" and you'll be no different. I'll need knothide leather and the hardened hide of Tyrantus. You'll find Tyrantus in Eco-Dome Farfield, located in the northern reaches of Netherstorm. 
Find the Sealed Box and then deliver it to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside of the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	Investigate Tuurem	You know, come to think of it, I do recall selling several boxes of strange and exotic engineering parts to Empoor about a month ago. I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to Tuurem. Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there? 
Speak to Ramdor the Mad, standing on the bone pile outside of the Auchenai Crypts.	I See Dead Draenei	I see dead draenei. They're all around us. Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me.<Ha'lei points to Ramdor.>He believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it! It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up! You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest. 
Hold off the attackers and speak with Rilak.	The Skettis Offensive	Skettis has waged war on us! Have you gathered enough to help with Shattrath's defense? Hold off the attackers! 
Locate Marcus Auralion, High General of the Sha'tar, at Crimson Watch. Look for him inside a crystalline prison.	The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of War	This journal documents the recent activities of Illidan's armies. It also explains why Val'zareq was parading around the Path of Conquest. He was personally responsible for the capture of a high general of the Sha'tar. This general is being held at a post known as Crimson Watch, located at the southern end of the Path of Conquest. A mysterious faction, calling itself the Crimson Sigil, is charged with his incarceration. If you choose to investigate, it would be wise to bring allies. 
Meet Illidan Stormrage. Seek out Barthamus in the Lower City of Shattrath should you survive.	Lord Illidan Stormrage	Come, highlord George. Illidan himself awaits us! 
Kill Urga'zz and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.	Beneath Thrallmar	I'm almost back in business. Problem is all these gan'arg are in my mine. I can't send my peons in and even once I fix this shredder I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader. If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave. Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here. 
	Accepting All Eggs	 
Find the Skull Piles in the middle of the summoning circles of Skettis. Summon and defeat each of the descendants by using 10 Time-Lost Scrolls at the Skull Pile. Return to Hazzik at Blackwind Landing with a token from each.	Adversarial Blood	The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book: Gezzarak the Huntress, Karrog the crystal giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vakkiz the Windrager. They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis. Bring me a token from each one. These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends. 
Return to Shadowmoon Village and speak with Overlord Or'barokh.	News of Victory	You must bring word of our success to Overlord Or'barokh immediately! Now that we've crushed the Legion and obliterated their presence in Shadowmoon Valley, the overlord can turn his attention to our other foes. Although the Kor'kron guard will never admit it, they'll be glad we're no longer fighting on two fronts. 
Use the Rune Activation Device near the East Rune, Northeast Rune, and West Rune. The runes can be found around the perimeter of Kirin'Var Village's Wizard Row and Town Square districts. Return to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran once you've completed the task.	Building a Perimeter	We are prepared to try to construct a perimeter around the village using the energy source taken from the blood elves. I can't guarantee that it will work, but we have to attempt it. Otherwise, the mana creatures will surely continue devouring the spirits of the fallen Kirin Tor. Use this device at the small runes around the perimeter of town to release the energy there. If I've woven the field correctly, we should start noticing a difference once you've used the device at each point. 
Locate Apex and obtain Apex's Crystal Focus from him. Return to the Violet Tower and use Apex's Crystal Focus near Archmage Vargoth's Orb to discover who holds the key to breaking the tower's curse.	Finding the Keymaster	In retrospect, I suppose I should've expected Kael'thas's magic to be this robust. He's always been a talented mage, but I've never seen anything like the power he wielded during the attack on the tower. The ward keeps me from being able to scry out the force holding it in place, but it doesn't preclude you from scrying. You'll require a focus, though. A crystal-bearing giant named Apex roams the plains to the west of Manaforge Duro. One of its crystals would make an excellent scrying focus. 
Return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Return to the Marsh	Return to Ysiel and let her know that help will be extended to her as soon as it is possible. Affairs in Moonglade and Silithus have kept our members occupied, but we will do our best to send the necessary resources to the Cenarion Refuge. 
Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the First Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation.	The Cipher of Damnation - Grom'tor's Charge	This naga filth is the sixth one I've interrogated today. He's got the fancy armor so I figured he knew something. Those other ones were useless.<Grom'tor points to the corpses of the naga around him.>I only had to beat him once and he told me everything. The first part of the cipher is hidden in a naga chest at Coilskar Point or Coilskar Cistern, east of here. He says naga carry the keys. Kill 'em, take their keys and use them to open the Coilskar chests. Return to me when you find the cipher. 
The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to use the Protectorate Disruptor to bring down Salhadaar's force fields and then destroy Nexus-King Salhadaar.	Nexus-King Salhadaar	I have in my possession another disruptor, one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, George. If you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor. 
Speak with Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know	George, I think that after you're done celebrating here, you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren. I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there. 
Use the Rod of Purification on the Darkstone of Terokk in Veil Skith and return to Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan in Bone Wastes.	Veil Skith: Darkstone of Terokk	Veil Skith lies to the northwest of the caravan and to the south of Shattrath in a secluded grove of the forest. It is rumored that the colony of Skettis has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the arakkoa of Skith are ever to be redeemed. Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by A'dal, the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee. 
Kill Terrorclaw and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.	Pursuing Terrorclaw	I've caught every kind of fish that lives in the marsh, but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught eels and mudfin frenzies. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away. Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way. 
Venture into Tempest Keep's Botanica and retrieve the Keystone from Commander Sarannis. Bring it to Archmage Vargoth at the Violet Tower.	Capturing the Keystone	It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton. In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone. Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom. 
Oakun wants you to travel east to the Derelict Caravan to recover the Dread Relic. Return to Oakun when the task is complete.	The Dread Relic	Long ago a caravan went to Auchindoun with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing. The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched. Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east. This dark artifact is the key to a terrible plan to defeat Teribus the Cursed, a creature that flies over the Bone Wastes. Help me if you wish, but your life and even your soul will be at risk. 
	Allegiance to the Aldor	 
Go to the top of the Atam'al Terrace in Shadowmoon Valley and obtain the Heart of Fury. Return to Akama at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley when you've completed this task.	The Ata'mal Terrace	It has been known to us that the fel orcs, under Illidan's command, have guarded an Ata'mal crystal known as the Heart of Fury at the Ata'mal Terrace. They cloud its presence with dark magic, to keep it from the Sha'tar. Fight your way to the Atam'al Terrace outside the Black Temple and turn your eyes to the sky. Shadowlord Deathwail will circle the terrace, beyond your reach. You will have to slay him and his warlocks before you can obtain the crystal. It won't be easy, George. I wish you luck. 
	In Service of the Illidari	Netherwing Ledge... What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the orcs may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw. I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage. 
Use the Seed of Revitalization at the Earthbinder's Circle to heal the land around the crystal. Then, return to Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula with any information that you gain.	Natural Remedies	It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane. It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power. I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge. Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation. Beware, George, I sense an external force at play here... this is not natural! 
Use the Wolf Totem at the location where you found Krun Spinebreaker's body and follow the Ancestral Spirit Wolf.	A Spirit Guide	Even our best tracking wolves' senses can fail them, George. The spirits have a way of seeing the world differently than ours. The being you will call forth will find the person you seek, for they'll be drawn not to their scent but their essence. Go now, Mechanic, take this totem with you and use it at the location you found the stone axe. 
Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Third Part of the Cipher of Damnation from Ruul the Darkener. This mission will require a group.	The Cipher of Damnation - Borak's Charge	That Cipher fragment will never reach Zuluhed. You're going to ambush Ruul the Darkener and his transport before it has a chance to make the delivery. The Dragonmaw Fortress is directly east of here, across the Netherwing Fields. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the Sanctum of the Stars is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And George, from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up. Return the Cipher to me should you succeed. 
Take the Murkblood Invasion Plans to Garrosh.	Murkblood Invaders	The parchment holds a crudely painted map of Nagrand. There is a big red 'X' where Garadar would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to Garrosh in Garadar. 
Speak with Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Assisting the Consortium	The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things. Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured. There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals. As a representative of the Scryers, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can. 
David Wayne at Wayne's Retreat wants you to bring him an Overcharged Manacell.	Fresh from the Mechanar	Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply. I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power. The Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here. 
Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Stormcrow Amulet to explore the major lakes in Zangarmarsh.	As the Crow Flies	We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly. Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking. If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh. Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin. I will guide your way back to safety after we're done. 
Skyguard Khatie has asked you to wrangle 5 Aether Rays. After you have done so, return them to her at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Wrangle More Aether Rays!	So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays! From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope! And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect Ogri'la, which the ogres appreciate. Remember, the aether rays fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast. Think you can wrangle me up some more? 
Arechron at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill Ortor of Murkblood.	Ortor My Old Friend...	These invasion plans were written by someone I once knew. Ortor of Murkblood, once a noble Broken, versed in the way of the elements, now a muck addled yes-man of Musel'ek the bog lord. The plans state that they have taken over an orc village northwest of here known as Sunspring. Travel to Sunspring Post and rid the world of Ortor of Murkblood. What you do, you do for the good of us all... 
Jorin Deadeye has asked that you find and speak with Kilrath.	The Impotent Leader	I have escaped certain death, surviving a cowardly nighttime attack by Boulderfist ogres upon my village. But I ask you, stranger: For what?<Jorin points to Garrosh.>He has refused to give us assistance. Ogres are rampaging through my town and he sits here, weeping into a fire. What has become of us? What will become of us? I've sent a scout, Kilrath, to the village, now the Bleeding Hollow Ruins. Will you find him and give him your assistance? He hides on the border of Nagrand and Terokkar. 
Retrieve the Teleporter Power Pack and bring it to the Ethereal Teleport Pad on the Celestial Ridge to the east of Manaforge Ultris. Activate the pad and give the Teleporter Power Pack to the Image of Wind Trader Marid so he can install it.	A Not-So-Modest Proposal	From the look on your face, I can tell you're a Human who appreciates a good profit. I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture. I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge. First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in Access Shaft Zeon, which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal. 
Follow Wing Commander Mulverick while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Wing Commander Mulverick, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick	Three years of blood, sweat and tears. Mostly tears... The amount of crying that a hardened soldier does when it comes down to all-out war is amazing!""They're jumping into our tower with their horses!"" ""Why is their base so well defended?"" ""They're taking our relief hut, I'm going A.W.O.L.!""Wimps...I took the first train out of ""cry-town"" the minute the Dark Portal opened. Now I'm a top gun for the Dragonmaw. If you want to be top orc, you'll have to defeat me. We go when you are ready. 
Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the first triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to Dealer Hazzin at the Protectorate Watchpost on the Manaforge Ultris island in the Netherstorm.	Triangulation Point One	There is another reason for the retrieval of the surveying equipment. There is a crystal from draenei legend of great importance to me. It is said that the crystal bestows god-like powers to its bearer! But it is in danger of being unearthed by others - namely the Burning Legion. George, take the equipment and use it to find the first triangulation point. We know it to be somewhere to the east near Manaforge Ultris. Afterward, check-in with my agent, Dealer Hazzin, on the Manaforge Ultris island. 
Take Borak's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Cipher of Damnation - The Third Fragment Recovered	Take this box to my father. He still resides at Oronok's Farm, far to the north, above Coilskar Cistern. When all three fragments are pieced together, the ancient words will be known once more. Good luck, George. Tell my father that I will be home soon. 
Collect 10 Boxes of Mushrooms and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.	Stealing Back the Mushrooms	Mechanic, I've got an idea. I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory! Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge. The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there. I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too! Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment. 
Bring the Swirling Timewarped Vial to the central dome in Shattrath.	The Swirling Vial	As you touch the vial, your mind is flooded with memories, not all of which are your own. The most vivid is a memory of exchanging a similar vial with someone in Shattrath, with A'dal's light shining behind you. Despite your best efforts however, you can't pinpoint when that might have been - maybe it hasn't been, and is yet to be? 
	Drain Schematics	The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake. If the schematics are correct, there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake. Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge. 
The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Cloak.	Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak	Many a cruel act he committed but none so cold as the slaughter of the clerics of Karabor. After Gul'dan's Horde defeated the draenei of Karabor, the surviving clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to Hellfire Citadel as prisoners of war. Gorefiend, not yet a death knight, murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood. They now roam in front of the Black Temple with vengeance in their hearts. It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend. 
Chu'a'lor has asked you to obtain an Apexis Guardian's Head for him as proof. Return with it to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.	Guardian of the Monument	You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround. These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take many more apexis shards to activate and require four persons to operate. Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use. These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la. We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof. 
Find someone at the Throne of the Elements that knows how to speak Kalimag and show them the Howling Wind.	The Howling Wind	This amorphous mass of elemental air is speaking to you in a language that you cannot understand. You believe the language to be the tongue of the elements: Kalimag. Perhaps someone at the Throne of the Elements could shed some insight on this unusual find. 
Activate the Scrap Reaver X6000 Controller and test out its capabilities. Then give your feedback to Doctor Vomisa, Ph. T at the Proving Grounds in the Netherstorm. Deal with any problems that arise.	You, Robot	Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at your service. Here, take this controller. I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin. Just stay nearby! The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function. Try out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run. 
Dizzy Dina has asked you to acquire 5 Ether-Energized Flesh and return them to her at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	More than a Pound of Flesh	George, I've got something else for you to do. One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge. More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there.<Dizzy makes a disgusted face.>But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have. I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do? 
Sky Sergeant Vanderlip has tasked you with the bombing of 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. Return to her at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.	Bombing Run	You can fly around as a crow... so what! Ever annihilate something on the ground while you were flying? Want to? Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la. With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business. Want to prove yourself? Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks. Just don't let them shoot you down, too! 
Slay Terrorclaw and return to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.	The Terror of Marshlight Lake	Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed. I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet. 
Toshley wants you to retrieve the Collection of Souls and return it to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Show Them Gnome Mercy!	<The blood drains out of Toshley's face.>These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls! How dare they! Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north?!George, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan. You'll have to coax him out of hiding though. I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal. Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has. 
	Fel Armaments	 
Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to Grokom Deatheye at Shadowmoon Village.	Illidari-Bane Shard	The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light. The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Shadowmoon Village might be able to tell you more about it. 
Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to recover Boulderfist Plans.	Do My Eyes Deceive Me	Do my eyes deceive me or is there an ogre hunting party over yonder? What could ogres be doing this far from their mound? I don't like this one bit, stranger. First Murkbloods and now ogres. We just don't have the manpower to handle all of these threats to our land. Could you investigate the ogre presence to the east for us? Their forward camp is about 200 paces east of here. You'll know you're at the right place if you see the Boulderfist hunters. Kill them to find the plans! 
Recover the Salvaged Ethereum Prison Key for Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.	A Mission of Mercy	We salvaged this prison orb on our last scouting mission into Ethereum territory. We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting. We think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside. What we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb. 
Bring a Fel Armament to Ishanah in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	A Cleansing Light	This temple is one of the holiest places in all of Outland. The power of the Light here is so strong, that even items with the strongest fel taint can be cleansed of a worldly item. Should you run into any fel armaments in your confrontations with demonic enemies, bring them to me and I will demonstrate the cleansing power of the Light. 
Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch wants you to lure Viera Sunwhisper away from the settlement and then use Carinda's Scroll of Retribution on her.	Arelion's Mistress	With all the important matters at hand Arelion still found time in his schedule to see a mistress! It's all becoming perfectly clear. Viera Sunwhisper, that filthy wench... we'll show her to never cross a magistrix again. Take this scroll and find Viera. Find a way to lure her away from town and use the scroll on her. Arelion mentioned she couldn't resist a particular wine harvested by the cenarion druids. You might find some at Cenarion Refuge, just inside Zangarmarsh, west of here. 
Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash wants you to gather 8 Purified Helboar Meat. To purify the meat, use the Purification Mixture on the Tainted Helboar Meat you gather from Helboars.	Helboar, the Other White Meat	Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch? A side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it. This place is littered with helboars. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck!<Legassi rummages around in his pack and produces a flask.>This wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else! 
	More Feathers	 
	Karabor Training Grounds	Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor. Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss. Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself. I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons. We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not. 
Obtain an Arklon Crystal Artifact and return it to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Consortium Crystal Collection	Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast. They're old draenei ruins. Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation. If you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named Pentatharon. 
Kill Arazzius the Cruel, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.	Cruel's Intentions	Magister Bloodhawk finally deciphered the Legion missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord Kazzak's lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in Hellfire. The time has come to terminate his command, George. Terminate with extreme prejudice. Head west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned. 
Use the Ethereum Key Tablet - Alpha to open Stasis Chamber Alpha at Bash'ir's Landing in Blade's Edge Mountains. Return Evidence from Alpha to the Image of Commander Ameer at Bash'ir's Landing.	Stasis Chambers of Bash'ir	The Ethereum have a settlement on the northernmost shelf of Blade's Edge Mountains known as Bash'ir's Landing. According to the key tablet, much larger versions of the prisons are kept at Bash'ir's. It should also be noted that the Ethereum refer to those prisons as stasis chambers. The key tablet grants access to a very specific stasis chamber at the landing known as Stasis Chamber Alpha. Take the key and investigate. My image will be awaiting your return at Bash'ir's Landing. Speak to me there. 
Escort the Mag'har Captive out of Sunspring Post. Speak to Garrosh at Garadar if you succeed.	The Totem of Kar'dash	Thank you, stranger. They would have surely killed me had it not been for you. I was kidnapped by these Murkbloods 3 nights ago during a nighttime raid on Garadar. What I have since uncovered may very well shake the foundation of the Outland: these savages seek to recover the totem of Kar'dash! We cannot allow the totem to fall into the hands of the Murkbloods! You must help me escape. And stranger, if I do not make it back to Garadar, you must tell Garrosh what happened here... 
Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower when you've completed your task.	The Summoning Chamber	In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures. The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics. 
Wazat in Nagrand wants you to use the Jump-a-tron 4000 to get to the nest in the nearby tree and steal the Mysterious Egg.	Bring Me The Egg!	Now that you've been initiated, I want you to get me that egg! Use the Jump-a-tron and try to hit the nest dead center. But be careful! Bodily injury or serious permanent damage may occur from a bad jump. 
Vindicator Haylen wants you to slay 20 Dreadfang Widows and then return to him just west of Netherweb Ridge.	For the Fallen	When the dreadfang widows attacked our outpost we heard the voice of the naaru calling us to battle. We pursued the creatures into the night. Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten. Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long. Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten. 
Report to Commander Duron at the Stair of Destiny in Hellfire Peninsula. The Honor Hold Mage in the Mage District can help you get there.	Hero's Call: Outland!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Commander Duron in Hellfire Peninsula. The expeditionary forces require your help to overcome the demonic armies of the Burning Legion! Talk to the Honor Hold Mage in the tall tower in the Mage District to travel to Blasted Lands, then walk through the Dark Portal to arrive at the Stair of Destiny. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Gshaff wants you to gather 6 Fertile Spores from the various Zangarmarsh Spore Bats and Marsh Walkers. Return to Ghsaff at Sporeggar when you've completed this task.	Fertile Spores	Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh. As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited. Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores. All of Sporeggar will be in your debt. 
Oakun wants you to take the Dread Relic to the Writhing Mound. Once there, kill Auchenai Death-Speakers and Auchenai Doomsayers to collect 20 Doom Skulls. Then find the Writhing Mound Summoning Circle and use the Dread Relic to summon and destroy Teribus the Cursed. Return to Oakun when the deed is done.	Evil Draws Near	Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed. To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather. The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments. If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you. 
Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Sunfury Signets. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause you Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Sunfury Signets	As you might know, the Scryers and the armies of Kael'thas are at war. Kael sees us as a threat to his influence over other blood elves and has tried to crush us time and again. If you wish to aid us in our battle against Kael'thas, there are plenty of targets for you to go after. Kael's highest ranking soldiers wear Sunfury signets to mark their ranks. You will find them all over Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley. 
	Forward Base: Reaver's Fall	Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, Mechanic. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Maimfist's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in...Head east about 200 paces and veer south at the jutting mass of land. You'll see Reaver's Fall where an old farm used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Foward Commander To'arch. Now move out! 
Gahk has asked you to acquire a Fel Whip. Bring it to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	A Fel Whip For Gahk	Gahk think being smart is dumb sometimes. Gahk not want to think. Me want little Human to smash big demons! Dey have some chiefs, and da chiefs all have whips to hurt da little demons. You bring Gahk a whip! You challenge demon chief in forge camps at burning, green, fel crystal prism. Use many apexis shards to get dem to come. Dey called Galvanoth, Braxxus, Zarcsin and da Mo'arg Incinerator. 
Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to recover Raliq's Debt, Coosh'coosh's Debt and Floon's Debt.	Crackin' Some Skulls	<Sal'salabim laughs.>This Sal'salabim design.<Sal'salabim points to the architecture and formations on the blueprints.>Look at towers. Demon hunter no can see, yes? Poor, poor Altruis. He cry if he had eyes, yes? Yes, Sal'salabim help but first you help Sal'salabim.<Sal'salabim gives you a ledger.>These creatures owe Sal'salabim golds. Many golds. Go collect for Sal'salabim and come back. They no give you Sal'salabim gold easy. Have to fight, but you strong. You defeat Sal'salabim! 
Locate a Soul Mirror somewhere in the Auchenai Crypts and use it to call forth a Darkened Spirit from Ancient Orc Ancestors in Nagrand. Destroy 15 Darkened Spirits so that the ancestors may rest in peace. Return to Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds when this task is complete.	What the Soul Sees	For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state. Regrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist. Your only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them... 
Retrieve the Thunderlord Clan Drum, Thunderlord Clan Arrow and the Thunderlord Clan Tablet. Return them, along with the Thunderlord Clan Artifact, to Rokgah Bloodgrip at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Thunderlord Clan Artifacts	The artifact bears markings that indicate its origins as being created by the Thunderlord clan orcs. These orcs used to live at Thunderlord Stronghold before they were changed into fel orcs. For a time the Bladespire ogres inhabited the stronghold until recently when the Horde pushed them out. You've heard of other artifacts that were lost. A drum, an arrow and a tablet come to mind as objects that you know are being sought after. Find them in Bladespire Hold and return them to Rokgar Bloodgrip. 
Retrieve Archmage Vargoth's Staff from Ekkorash the Inquisitor and bring it to Ravandwyr in Area 52. To bring Ekkorash out of hiding, sprinkle the Conjuring Powder on the brazier in the center of the ruins.	The Archmage's Staff	Allow me to introduce myself, Mechanic. I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the Archmage Vargoth. My master is... indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance. The Arklon Ruins southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff. This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins. 
Battle the forces of Illidan at Crimson Watch and survive! Return to A'dal at Shattrath City should you emerge the victor.	Battle of the Crimson Watch	They are probably searching for you on the Path of Conquest as we speak. You must make your escape, Human! Leave me, I'm done for... They... I think I hear them coming. It's now or never! Get out! If you choose to stay, you will have to fight! If you fight and somehow manage to survive, take what you have learned here and deliver that knowledge to A'dal in Shattrath City. 
Agent Ya-six at Access Shaft Zeon in Netherstorm has asked you to slay Arconus the Insatiable and return to Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.	Arconus the Insatiable	Araxes and I were deployed to Ultris 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the void lord Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area. A fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles! If you can take out Arconus, high command would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian. 
Meet with Vormu in Shattrath.	A Timely Summons from Shattrath	The blazing star holds a peculiar alignment this cycle, calling out across the heavens. Seek out the sage Vormu in Shattrath City, and lend her your aid. 
Kill 20 Shattered Hand orcs, then return to Apothecary Antonivich in Thrallmar.	A Burden of Souls	I have a device, the Demoniac Scryer, that can analyze fel magic. I would have you use the Scryer, but first... you must appease it. The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric. To appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs. Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs -- the Scryer demands their souls. Return to me when the souls are reaped. You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding... Hellfire Citadel. 
	Malfas the Purple Netherwing Drake	 
Take Avruu's Orb to the Haal'eshi Altar southeast of the Den of Haal'esh in Hellfire Peninsula and give it to Aeranas once he's free.	Avruu's Orb	<As you hold the orb closer to you, you hear a voice address you.>I sense you're not of the arakkoa, so I will attempt to barter for my freedom. My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds. The Haal'eshi mage, Avruu, trapped me inside this orb. Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me. It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den. Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free. In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure! 
Obtain an Elixir of Shadows from Severin and use it to find and slay Talonpriest Ishaal, Talonpriest Skizzik and Talonpriest Zellek in Skettis. Return to Commander Adaris after completing this task.	Secrets of the Talonpriests	Thank you for paying heed to my fevered rants. All along we had been trying to identify and destroy the Skettis chain of command; we had learned of three clerics known as the talonpriests, but we'd never seen them with our own two eyes. Now we know why. Talk to Severin to obtain more of the elixir he discovered. Use the elixir to find and kill the three talonpriests: Ishaal, Skizzik and Zellek. They're rumored to dwell in Veil Ala'rak, near the eastern shore of Blackwind Lake. 
Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.	Spleendid!	Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say! But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons. The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin. Start your search directly east of here. 
Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to free 5 Enslaved Netherwing Drakes.	The Force of Neltharaku	Take this enchanted nethervine crystal and make your way back to Dragonmaw Fortress. Once there, seek out the enslaved drakes and invoke the magic of the nethervine crystal. My own energies will pour forth, causing the drakes to break free from the bond of their captors. When you see that the drake has broken free, help it defeat its captor! It will most assuredly be weak from the imprisonment. Release all that you can find and return to me, George. 
Speak to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Bow to the Highlord	I am unworthy to even carry a message directed at you, sir. Please forgive me for this indulgence. Overlord Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his chambers at once! 
	Onyxien the Onyx Netherwing Drake	 
Defeat enemies around Portal Grimh and Portal Kaalez to gather Demonic Rune Stones. Use Kingston's Primer inside Portal Grimh and Portal Kaalez. Return to Forward Commander Kingston with the remaining explosives.	Disrupt Their Reinforcements	You'll find the Legion front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout Outland. We, George, are going to destroy those portals! Take this primer. Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device! Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals... then watch the fireworks!!Go, George, and return to me when your mission is complete. 
Retrieve Slaag's Standard and deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Even Gronn Have Standards	Are you familiar with Shattrath City, Mechanic? Above it to the northwest is a place called the Barrier Hills, which you can only get to upon a flying mount. One of Gruul's sons, Slaag, exiled himself and took control of the Gordunni ogres that reside there. Even at such a distance, we cannot afford to leave him in peace, lest he return when the rest of his brothers have been slain. George, you must travel there, and bring back his standard as proof that he has been dealt with. 
Slay 8 Sunfury Magisters and 8 Sunfury Bloodwarders and return to Exarch Orelis at Area 52. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	Distraction at Manaforge B'naar	We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate the manaforges that Kael'thas' army is operating here. Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action. We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work. Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar. 
Escort Fhwoor into the area of the Marshlight steam pump to retrieve the Ark of Ssslith. Bring Fhwoor and the ark back safely and then report back to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.	Fhwoor Smash!	Little naga make Fhwoor angry! Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark. We go into nearby naga village. You help? Bring friends! 
Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 20 Deathshadow Agents.	Disrupting the Twilight Portal	One of your responsibilities as a captain of Dragonmaw is to snuff out Burning Legion activity in Outland. It is your duty to silence those that defy Lord Illidan! The demons foolishly attempt to stabilize the portal found on the Twilight Ridge of western Nagrand. They must pay for their treachery, and you will be the orc that collects on their debt. Travel to the Twilight Ridge and lay waste to its inhabitants. You will be responsible for making at least one attack per day on their fortifications. 
Go through the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands. The Honor Hold Mage in the Mage District can help you get there.	Burning Crusade: To Outland!	The Burning Legion - an uncountably vast army of demons - has assaulted Outland, the tattered homeworld of the draenei. Adventurers of the Alliance are needed to protect what remains of Outland from utter annihilation at the hands of this demonic invasion. Travel to the Blasted Lands, and pass through the Dark Portal. 
Bring 8 Dampscale Basilisk Eyes to Arcanist Adyria in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Voren'thal's Visions	Our leader, Voren'thal the Seer, was once a close advisor to Kael'thas. His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race. The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance. Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes. My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me. Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes. 
Give the Bundle of Skins to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.	I'm Saved!	I don't mind sharing. I'm just glad to be saved from that creep, Gankly! And I collected tons of skins from Zangarmarsh, so it's no problem at all! 
Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to recover Enormous Bone Worm Organs. He wants his Fumper back too.	The Big Bone Worm	I was right! These carcasses you brought me belong to the baby bone worms. Do you know what that means? It means that somewhere out there is a big one! I think we can get it to come out if we can provide the right kind of food. Let's see... something big! Yes! I remember seeing clefthooves east of here on the other side of the Bone Wastes. Get out there and kill a clefthoof. Once it's dead, use the drums. Hopefully the big one will come up to feed. If you manage to kill it, bring me its organs! 
Escort Drijya to the warp-gate at Invasion Point: Destroyer, and see to it that he is kept safe while he attempts to sabotage it. Then speak to Gahruj at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	Sabotage the Warp-Gate!	With the Burning Legion nearby at the fel reaver scrap field, we must do what we can to stop the flow of demons into the area. They have a warp-gate to the south in an area that they've cleverly named Invasion Point: Destroyer. I need you to go with me to the site and keep me safe while I sabotage it. Afterward, go to the Midrealm Post to the north inside Eco-Dome Midrealm and apprise Gahruj of our success. We're going to need a friend or two of yours along to help with this. 
Leoroxx has beseeched you to retrieve the Collection of Souls and return them to Spiritcaller Dohgar at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	There Can Be Only One Response	There can be only one response to this... this, DEFILEMENT of the souls of our ancestors! George, if you would aid us to restore the souls of our honored dead to their rightful place, go back to Razaan's Landing. Go back up there and kill the razaani until their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan shows his cowardly face. Kill him and get those souls back, and then give them over to Spiritcaller Dohgar! 
Chu'a'lor has asked you to speak with Sky Commander Keller at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Skyguard Outpost	George, we were wondering if you might be willing to visit our friends just to the north at the Skyguard Outpost? Sky Commander Keller and his Skyguard are here running missions for our mutual protection, and he's asked us to send along anyone that we feel would excel at helping out. That would be you! Head up there as soon as you can, and please, give him our regards. 
Speak with Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	Help Mama Wheeler	Say, George, I was wondering if you could do me another favor. My partner out in the field could probably use a hand. I was wondering if you could go check in on her. I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help. Just don't mind her sharp tongue. She's trying to look out for our interests to the east. You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post. 
Kill Grishna arakkoa to gain Understanding Ravenspeech for 2 minutes. While under the effects of the spell, you can find and receive the prophecy from the four shrines. Return when you have visited all four.	Whispers of the Raven God	At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us. Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message. Discover this for us, George. 
Blood Guard Gulmok outside of Shadowmoon Village, wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.	Besieged!	<Gulmok looks to the sky.>Our scouts are putting up a good fight, but the infernals keep coming! From their base of Legion Hold to the southwest, the demons bombard us with impunity! Even the elite Kor'kron guard cannot hold them off forever. I'm drafting every able-bodied Human to do their part in defense of Shadowmoon Village. This is no game, Mechanic. The survival of the village is at stake. Do your duty to the Horde, and join the fray! 
	Suraku the Azure Netherwing Drake	 
Collect 4 Teromoth Samples and 4 Vicious Teromoth Samples. Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	Strange Energy	Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket. Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain. And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close. I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal. Collect for me a number of samples from both. You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north. I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids. 
Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him 5 Ethereum Prison Keys.	A Thousand Worlds	I have cracked the code! Each tag is broken up into several segments. The front side of the tag is always the same and states: ""A Thousand Worlds..."" I am unsure as to the meaning of this phrase but it sounds insidious. On the back side of the tag are the vital statistics. The first set of runes indicates location and the second indicates prisoner type. Furthermore, it would seem that the keys can be combined to form a special key that accesses another prison type. Now I just need more keys... 
Forward Commander Kingston wants you to speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee, ride a gryphon to Shatter Point, and then report to Runetog Wildhammer.	Shatter Point	George, you've done a great job here at the front, and you showed a lot of talent with that armored gryphon... I think I have another mission in mind for you. This new mission launches from Shatter Point -- an attack base the Wildhammers set up on a floating piece of land near the Portal. It's a little unnerving there, but you have tough guts. You'll be fine. Talk to Wing Commander Dabir'ee and have him send you to Shatter Point. From there, report to the gryphon master Runetog Wildhammer. 
Use Zezzak's Shard to capture an Eye of Grillok, then approach Zezzak's cauldron to extract it. After it is removed, return Zezzak's Shard to him.	The Eyes of Grillok	George, you have braved the lair of the Bleeding Hollow orcs, dreaded Zeth'Gor, and survived! Perhaps you have the strength to aid me, for I aim to gaze into the mind of its darkest witch, Grillok! Take this shard. Use it to ensorcel an Eye of Grillok and bind it to yourself. Return here and approach my cauldron... and it will pull the eye from you. Go, George. And use care -- An Eye of Grillok will betray you to our enemies if given the slightest opening! 
Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to collect 20 Kil'sorrow Armaments.	Armaments for Deception	You will need to steal Kil'sorrow armaments from Kil'sorrow Fortress if my plan is to work. Search the fortress for crates of Kil'sorrow armaments. Bring whatever you can find to me. Kil'sorrow Fortress is located directly south and a little to the west of the Burning Blade Ruins. 
Place the Signaling Gem near the Altar of Aggonar at the Pools of Aggonar and defeat any Draenei Anchorites that respond to your summons. Return to Ryathen the Somber at Falcon Watch with the Signaling Gem after completing this task.	The Cleansing Must Be Stopped	Our scouts captured a draenei paladin at the Pools of Aggonar. He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools. We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of felblood! He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a priest - or ""anchorite"" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety. Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei. I suggest that you take a friend or two along. 
Go into the Shadow Tomb, west of the Refugee Caravan and retrieve the Drape of Arunen, the Gavel of K'alen and the Scroll of Atalor. Return to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan after you've completed this task.	The Shadow Tomb	Many believe it was the Shadow Council that caused the explosion that tore Auchindoun apart. It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside. If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them. According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun. They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun. Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor. I must ask you to retrieve them. 
Exarch Onaala wants you to return to the Ruins of Karabor and find a way to unleash Azaloth on his captors. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	A Necessary Distraction	The weapons are authentic, as we feared. Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it. Do not be fooled by their name, George, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon. Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training. A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished. Find a way to let him loose on his captors. That should buy us the time we need. 
Kill Dr. Boom and return with the good news to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Dr. Boom!	George, my former protege, Sparky Uberthruster, wouldn't wear his helmet while down here and one day transformed into the infamous Dr. Boom! And he stole off to the northeast with most of our sapping equipment! He and his Boom Bots have been a menace to Area 52 ever since. I need you to go to his Camp of Boom just outside of town and put an end to him! Use these Boom's Doom bombs to take him out. And make sure not to get too close to him or his Boom Bots! 
Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?	We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time. George, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening. There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest. 
Kronk has asked you to use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror atop the Blade's Edge Mountains. Return it to him once you have done so.	Banish More Demons	If we know the demons, and we do because we've studied them extensively, they're fast at work repairing any damage that has been done to their precious transporter. So, if you want a chance at another darkrune, take our banishing crystal back out there and eliminate more demons. Besides, you want to help us to lessen the threat that the demons pose, yes? We said ""chance"" because the process we use yields mixed results. You might get a darkrune, or you might get something else entirely. 
Zerid at Aeris Landing in Nagrand wants you to kill 12 Voidspawn near Oshu'gun.	Matters of Security	Gezhe chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew. Why? Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south. Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us. That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's. Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget. Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget. 
Slay Zandras at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley and return to Sanoru.	Proof of Allegiance	Akama has been tracking your progress quite closely, George. The Ashtongue you've slain at the Ruins of Baa'ri are amongst the most evil Broken known among us... carefully hand-picked by Akama himself to maintain the facade we need to present to Illidan. The Deathsworn, however, know of Akama's true intentions. First things first. We need to know that you are not with Illidan. A Satyr known as Zandras watches over us from above the prison walls on his behalf. Slay him as proof of your allegiance. 
Get a Vial of Underworld Loam from Hydromancer Thespia and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.	Underworld Loam	The frame that you brought me earlier will not be sufficient to hold molten metal without reinforcement. A rare kind of earth can be used to cool and imbue the frame, giving the adamantite an unnatural strength. Underwold loam, as the earth is known, is accorded great value among the naga. Few enough of them possess it, and in Outland, I know of only one naga who uses it -- Hydromancer Thespia, who resides in the Steamvault of Coilfang Reservoir. 
Find Borak, Son of Oronok near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley.	Borak, Son of Oronok	While Ar'tor was off hunting and Grom'tor was off fighting, Borak studied. Eventually he took up a vocation as a scholar and left for the wilds of Draenor. He returned home a few years ago a changed orc. His heightened sense of awareness and mental acuity had forged a silent assassin. Now a confident and powerful orc, he has taken to recovering the most guarded piece of the cipher. Find Borak hiding near Eclipse Point, far to the south. He watches from the shadows of the bridge. 
Obtain the four medallion fragments from Haalum, Eykenen, Lakaan and Uylaru and return to Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	The Ashtongue Corruptors	According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors. These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered. Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass. Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan. Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point. Find them and obtain the medallion fragments. 
Sky Commander Keller has asked you to speak with the Aether-tech Apprentice at the Skyguard Outpost in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Assault on Bash'ir Landing!	Heya, <boyo/girly>! Up fer some fun are ye? Every couple o' hours, me aether-techs launch an assault on Bash'ir Landing, far ta the northeast in the Blade's Edge Mountains. They say that they're there 'studying' the Bash'ir crystalforge, but it's an assault; there be no two ways about it. We use the crystalforge to resupply, and there's always extra to be sold. Go on down ta the landin' pad and speak with the aether-tech apprentice. He'll tell ye when the next mission is ta launch. 
Slay Gava'xi near Oshu'gun and return to Zerid at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.	Gava'xi	The presence of rogue ethereals in this area might amuse Gezhe, who sees nothing but opportunity wherever we go, but it's a true threat to the security of our operations. Their leader, Gava'xi, is a dangerous criminal and I've made it my top priority to see to it that he is neutralized. If you're looking to make yourself useful, go and take care of Gava'xi. I will see to it that you're rewarded properly. 
Lieutenant Meridian wants you to use The Final Code to set off the Mana Bomb. Then report back to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.	The Final Code	They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard. My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point. George, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him. He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire. Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off. Only then will we be certain that the Allerian Stronghold is safe. 
	More Marks of Sargeras	 
Bring the Damaged Mask to O'Mally Zapnabber in Ruuan Weald.	Damaged Mask	As you examine the damaged mask, you hear strange sounds coming from within. If the mask wasn't damaged you might be able to hear the sounds more clearly. O'Mally Zapnabber in Ruuan Weald might be able to fix the mask. 
Defeat Summoner Kanthin at Manaforge Duro, on the island to the north of Sunfury Hold, and reclaim the Stone of Glacius from him. When you have obtained the stone, use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to contact the archmage. If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.	Summoner Kanthin's Prize	The next thing we must do is reclaim my familiar, Glacius, from the blood elf summoner who holds it captive. Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy. I'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him. My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro,' if that terminology has any meaning for you. 
The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to escort the Protectorate Demolitionist to the Manaforge Ultris conduit and keep him protected while he works to sabotage the pipeline.	Delivering the Message	I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place the disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor. Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him as he is only a holographic image but the image can be destroyed! Return to me once the job is done. 
Gather up enough Costume Scraps from the various wyrmcultists to create an Overseer Disguise. Use the disguise to attend the meeting with Kolphis Darkscale, and report your findings back to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Meeting at the Blackwing Coven	I know what must be done! George, you must pose as Overseer Nuaar and attend that meeting! The wyrmcultists at the coven all have a standard outfit that they wear, so go collect scraps from them, and when you have enough, put together a disguise. Pose as Overseer Nuuar and speak with Kolphis Darkscale to see what he has to say, and then return to Tree Warden Chawn. You'll find the coven by heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel and following the path past the Raven's Wood and Grishnath to its end. 
Samia Inkling has asked you to use the Blackwhelp Net to capture 10 Wyrmcult Blackwhelps. Return them to her at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Whelps of the Wyrmcult	I need to examine the whelps that they are raising at the Blackwing Coven. There should be an abundance of them flying around inside their cavernous base, as well as a number of eggs, which if you get close to them will likely hatch. Please, George, take the net and capture a handful of them alive for me. Find them by heading west across the Wyrmskull Bridge and heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel. Follow the path to its end past Grishnath and the Raven's Wood. 
Deliver the Meeting Note to Watcher Moonshade at the entrance of the Wyrmskull Tunnel in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Wyrmskull Watcher	Hmm, I'm not certain what we should do. I'm not much of a military planner. Watcher Moonshade will know what to do. He's heading up our defensive efforts at the Wyrmskull Tunnel to the west at the end of Wyrmskull Bridge. We have a force out there just in case the cultists try anything funny. Please, take the note to him with all due haste. 
Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you find and speak with Lantresor of the Blade in the Burning Blade Ruins.	Diplomatic Measures	Kilrath sends news of the Boulderfist leader: He is an orc! An ancient orc that passed through the Dark Portal in the time of our fathers and has since returned to his homeland. I wish for you to track down this orc and try to convince him to pull back the Boulderfist ogres. He resides on an upper platform in the Burning Blade Ruins to the southeast near the border of Terokkar. Good luck, George! Be warned, he is a blademaster... 
Bring 8 Pristine Shimmerscale Eels to Seth in Shattrath.	Rather Be Fishin'	Speaking of lakes, there's a lake with real good fishin' up to the northeast. I used to go up there with my friends, but my mom won't let me go anymore. She says it's too dangerous, but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders. Like spiders can do anything to you...My favorites were always the eels that live up there. If you're going to be up by the lake, would you think about bringing back some of the eels? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em, you can bring 'em back no problem. 
Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to use the Sizzling Embers to summon a Living Flare and slay Incandescent Fel Sparks near it until it becomes an Unstable Living Flare. Return to the Legion Gateway with the Unstable Living Flare to destroy it.	Blast the Gateway	We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas. Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare. It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy. Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare. The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable. Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway. It will know what to do. 
Kill 30 Clefthoof Bulls and then speak to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand about your prowess.	Clefthoof Mastery	You've proved to me that you can find and take down a regular clefthoof, but far more dangerous are the clefthoof bulls. Bag yourself thirty of those. Then you can talk to me of your hunting prowess. Look for them all along the middle region of Nagrand to the west and south. 
Travel to the Path of Conquest in Shadowmoon Valley. Once you have done a preliminary assessment of the area, use the Kor'kron Flare Gun to signal a Kor'kron Wind Rider. Speak with Overlord Or'barokh should you lose your Kor'kron Flare Gun and require a replacement.	The Path of Conquest	Word has come from my wind riders, George. The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They have begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, far to the southeast - adjacent to Eclipse Point. I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you have done so, use this flare gun to signal a wind rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Inform them of what you have discovered and they will give you your next set of orders. 
Gather 8 Nether Dragon Essence, then return to the Ethereal Teleport Pad area. Nether Dragon Essence may be obtained from Nether Drakes or Nether Dragons.	Getting Down to Business	As you've no doubt seen, the area is teeming with nether dragons in various stages of growth. All nether dragons, young and old, contain an essence that's highly desired by K -- err, by a client of mine. Most people aren't willing to risk their lives to gather it, so we've got the place to ourselves. You can start by gathering the essence from any of the creatures out here, but it's imperative that we start building a supply right away. Return to me once you have the first batch. 
Smith Hauthaa needs you to produce 5 Cleansed Ata'mal Metal. Do so by breaking down Ata'mal Armaments on her anvil at the Sun's Reach Armory on the Isle of Quel'Danas.	Ata'mal Armaments	The Ata'mal Terrace in eastern Shadowmoon Valley is holy to the draenei, but is now overrun by fel orcs. They have dug up the special ore from that place and created corrupted weapons and armor. I need the armaments to form an alloy with the naga ore. Our anchorites have blessed my anvil with the ability to cleanse them. Retrieve the armaments from the Shadowmoon chosen, slayers and darkweavers. Return them here, breaking down and purifying them upon my anvil, and then hand me the cleansed results. 
Flesh Handler Viridius at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you find and free Captain Tyralius.	Captain Tyralius	Captain Tyralius took a platoon of soldiers south towards the Ethereum Staging Grounds 10 days ago. We haven't heard from him or his crew since. Chances are good that they were ambushed and killed but I'm getting a curious reading from my instruments. I think it's a distress signal but these things have been wrong before. If Tyralius is still alive, they're keeping him in one of their prisons. You'll have to locate the prison and open it with a key, probably found on the warden. 
Collect 5 Grishnath Orbs and 5 Dire Pinfeathers and then combine them into Exorcism Feathers. Use these feathers to exorcise and slay 5 Koi-Koi Spirits from the Raven's Wood Leafbeards. Once you've done this, return to Treebole in the Raven's Wood of the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Exorcising the Trees	The Grishna have caused the leafbeards and stonebarks to be inhabited by evil koi-koi spirits. We must save the trees or soon all of the Raven's Wood will be lost forever! Combine the magic of a Grishnath orb, found throughout Grishnath, with a dire pinfeather from a dire raven. Use the resultant exorcism feather to draw out and slay the koi-koi spirit as quickly as possible. The stonebarks are too powerful for this ritual, but if enough leafbeards are saved, they will be freed as well. 
Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to retrieve 5 Muck-ridden Cores.	Muck Diving	The most affected elements of water can be found in the Halaani Basin, southwest of here, beneath the abandoned city of Halaa. While some distressed elements can be destroyed without any impact upon the environment, spawns of muck must be physically removed from the world once destroyed. You see, muck spawns leave behind globules of tainted debris that if left untouched will spread and further contaminate the environment. Destroy these muck spawns and bring back their muck-ridden cores. 
Otonbu the Sage at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to use the Torch of Liquid Fire to destroy 10 Sunspring Villager corpses. Return the Torch of Liquid Fire when the task is complete.	Stopping the Spread	I have just gotten word of a catastrophe of epic proportions, George. The foul Murkblood have sacked the orc village of Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and murdered its residents. To make matters worse, they have begun dumping the bodies into Sunspring Lake. Should those bodies rot, our primary source of water in the region will be compromised. It's a gruesome task that I give you next but it must be done. Take this enchanted torch and return to Sunspring. Burn all of the rotting orc corpses... 
	Dissension Amongst the Ranks...	Gnomus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth. Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties! 
Use the Sunfury Disguise, go into Manaforge Coruu and listen to the conversation between Commander Dawnforge and Arcanist Ardonis. Report back to Caledis Brightdawn after completing this task. Completing tasks for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Information Gathering	I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained. It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion. We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago. He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it. Oh, I almost forgot. You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge. They will see right through the illusion. 
Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds in Nagrand has asked that you seek out the vision you had. Find K'ure in Oshu'gun.	When Spirits Speak	Oshu'gun - the diamond mountain - was once sacred to my people. It was there that the clans would gather every year to celebrate the springtime festival. It was there that our shaman communed with the honored ancestors. It was the center of our culture - until the shadows overtook us. When the clans became a horde, the spirits of Oshu'gun fell silent. The ancestors turned their backs on us. Yet something now draws them from their rest. Venture to Oshu'gun and discover what could trouble the spirits so. 
Travel to western Nagrand and find Altruis the Sufferer. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Altruis	You don't see many demon hunters nowawdays. They're viewed with suspicion by their own people and it's very rare to find one that doesn't have some sort of allegiance to Illidan. There are rumors of one such demon hunter out in Nagrand. His name is Altruis. He hates all demons with a passion and will help us if you can convince him that you share his goals. Go to western Nagrand and find him. He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds. 
Bring the Heart of Tusker to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand.	The Ultimate Bloodsport	The queen of all that dwell in Nagrand is known as Tusker. She's a giant elekk the likes of which you won't see anywhere else! You're right to be fearful of that name. Bach'lor, Gutripper, and Banthar are nothing when compared to her. It is said that she can be found on a huge bluff far to the southwest overlooking Oshu'gun. Bring me her massive heart if you dare. Do you want to leave a letter with me so that I can have it delivered to your next of kin in the likely event that you don't return? 
Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Horde Blade Throwers overlooking the Path of Glory. Then, bring the Flaming Torch to Dumphry in Honor Hold.	Laying Waste to the Unwanted	Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan. Across the Path of Glory, the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, George, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry. Take this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety. 
You have been asked by Commander Skyshadow to kill any 30 Bladespire Ogres in Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. Return to him at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.	The Bladespire Ogres	To the north of the Bloodmaul clan lies a threat more grave: Bladespire Hold. The Bladespire ogres are the strongest clan in the mountains, having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, and his seven sons. Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bloodmaul, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals. From Bloodmaul Hold head north through the ravine until you come to Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres therein as you can. 
Borgrim Stouthammer wants you to procure 11 Bloodmaul Brutebane Brew for him. Once you've done that, return it to him at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Strange Brew	If I'm going to start this vacation out right, then I'm going to need more brew. Unfortunately, the elves know nothing of the fine art of fermentation. I overheard that the Bloodmaul ogres down in the ravine have plenty. I'm willing to give it a try. Do me a favor? Head south through the Living Grove and then down the ramp to the east into Bloodmaul Outpost and procure me some? I hear they have big barrels of it laying around and that their brewmasters carry it around to all the other ogres. 
Toshley has asked you to take the Protovoltaic Magneto Collector and gather up 5 Electromentals. Return to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	Picking Up Some Power Converters	Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters! And you're going to get them back for me, sort of. No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters. So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it. It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere. 
Return to Akama at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley.	A Mysterious Portent	Before he died, Udalo appears to have written a single word on the floor beneath him. The writing is barely legible but you recognize the word Atam'al. Perhaps Akama will understand the meaning of his brethren's message. 
Collect 10 Etherlithium Matrix Crystals and return them to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	You're Hired!	Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade George! We're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket! But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it. That's where you come in. To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix. The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears! So head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me! Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts. 
Collect 3 Pair of Ivory Tusks and return them to Shadrek at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.	A Head Full of Ivory	Ivory is a much sought after prize. I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it. I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits. The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after. Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire. Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei. Do you and I have an understanding? 
Take the Burning Blade Peace Offering to Garrosh at Garadar.	Message to Garadar	<Lantresor points to an unmarked crate.>Take it. It is my offering to your people. You have single-handedly saved my clan from extermination. You may tell your leader that Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace.<Lantresor bows.> 
	Your Friend On The Inside	 
Chief Overseer Mudlump at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to discipline 20 lazy Dragonmaw Peons. You will also need to return your Booterang.	The Booterang: A Cure For The Common Worthless Peon	This is your booterang. There are many like it but this one is yours. As an overseer you will use this booterang to sow terror into the hearts of defiant peons. Proper use of the booterang will instill obedience and ensure subservience. Venture forth to the crystal fields and discipline any peons that you see slacking off. Show them the might of the booterang! 
Take the information that you beat out of Unkor back to Kilrath in Terokkar Forest.	Success!	For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under Krol and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in Nagrand and killed many of our people. We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated...Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. Lantresor of the Blade rules in his absence. 
Deliver Baron Sablemane's Poison to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Baron Sablemane's Poison	Here, take this to your master. I'm sure that whatever the reason, Rexxar will put it to good use. Oh, and do be certain to remind him that he owes me. He knows what I want, and I'm certain that however he intends to obtain it for me, I'll be seeing you again sooner than you think. Now, do be a good little <boy/girl> and run this up to Rexxar. 
Retrieve Grulloc's Dragon Skull and deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Grulloc Has Two Skulls	To the east, at the terminus of Dragons' End, is the Cursed Hollow. Therein, Grulloc, son of Gruul, plots his dimwitted schemes. I heard that one of his possessions was stolen from him through trickery. Was that you? Unfortunate that he was not slain in the process. If we are to regain our freedom, I would have you take his most prized possession, a dragon skull from when he rejoiced in his father's slaying of the Black Dragonflight. The only way you'll get the skull is to vanquish him. 
Arechron at Telaar has asked that you find and free Corki.	Corki's Gone Missing Again!	<Arechron sighs.>This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the Burning Blade Ruins recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more. He told me that he was going to investigate the Boulderfist menace for 'uncle' Mo'mor and ran off to the ogre mounds in the Halaani Basin, north of here. Do you think you could track him down? I would be eternally grateful. 
A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to recover the Unused Axe of the Executioner from the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel. This quest must be completed in Heroic dungeon difficulty.	Trial of the Naaru: Mercy	Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. Within the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel are three of your people. They are held there by the merciless one, Kargath Bladefist. He seeks to execute them as a sign of his virility and power. You must save these prisoners before such an atrocity can come to pass. As proof of deed, bring me the unused axe of the executioner. It must not have a drop of blood on its blade! 
Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 8 Earthen Souls and 8 Fiery Souls.	Enraged Spirits of Fire and Earth	We must try and make amends. We must commune with the elements of this region and see if anything can be done! I grant you the totem of spirits, Human. If you slay an enraged elemental spirit in close proximity of the totem, it will consume the elemental's soul. You must use the totem to consume many souls before you may return to me. Do this for the spirits of fire and earth first. Return to me when the totem is full. 
Help the Horde secure a Spirit Tower in the Bone Wastes.	Spirits of Auchindoun	The draenei might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in Auchindoun are restless and have no allegiance. The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day. If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun. The Alliance will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor. We must ensure that our side succeeds instead. 
Use the Battery Recharging Blaster on enough Phase Hunters to get the Battery Recharge Level to 10. Then return it to Bot-Specialist Alley at the Ruins of Enkaat in the Netherstorm.	Recharging the Batteries	I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up. The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy! You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether. Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy. 
Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 40 Nethercite Ore.	Nethercite Ore	A miner!<Varkule salutes.>An orc after my own heart! That's how Varkule got his start - minin'! There ain't nothin' better than getting down and dirty in the mines, is there? Now get out there and find those nethercite deposits. Strip 'em for all their worth and bring me back the ore. 
Anchorite Karja at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	Socrethar's Shadow	The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm. Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder. He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access. To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion. The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. 
Deliver the Letter from the Mag'har to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.	The Mag'har	This news you bring from beyond the Dark Portal... you want us to believe the son of Durotan now rules over the lands beyond it... free from any demonic taint? And that now his people have returned to this world? I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, Mechanic. What this means to my people... cannot be described. I must send word to Nagrand at once! Hellscream must hear about this. Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar. Tell him the Mag'har welcome them! 
Kill Force Commander Gorax, place the Challenge From the Horde upon his corpse, kill The Hand of Kargath, and then bring the Head of the Hand of Kargath to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.	The Foot of the Citadel	Force Commander Gorax is training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge. You must kill him, George, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the fel orcs. However, that is not all you must do. Take this banner. Place it atop Gorax's corpse. Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true orc blood within him! His head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek. 
Find 6 Shredder Parts and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.	Outland Sucks!	I can't believe I left Booty Bay to come to Outland. My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine. How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time? My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs. They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there. 
The Spirit of Ar'tor at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Second Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation from Veneratus the Many. Creatures attacked or damaged by the Spirit Hunter will not yield loot or experience.	The Cipher of Damnation - Ar'tor's Charge	At last, we are ready. I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil. You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point. Hidden in the ether is a vile creature known as Veneratus the Many. My spirit hunter will call him out when he is near. Destroy Veneratus and take from his corpse the second part of the Cipher of Damnation. 
Retrieve the Diagnostic Results and return them to Mehrdad at Midrealm Post.	Run a Diagnostic!	Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments. Netherstorm's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me? 
Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 30 Netherwing Crystals.	Netherwing Crystals	No good at nothin'? That's fine. Even lunkheads like you can be used around here. Just find creatures on the ledge and kill 'em. Sometimes they'll have nether crystals on their carcasses. Gather those and bring 'em back to me and I'll consider your work order for the day complete. 
Speak with Orik Trueheart in Dalaran.	Seeker of Truth	You may be familiar with Orik Trueheart. He has devoted his time after the Northrend campaign to learning more about Tyr. Orik has evidence of a powerful shield crafted by Tyr long ago. With the help of the Sunwalkers, we may finally be able to seek it out. Please speak to him immediately. 
Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to go to the Pools of Aggonar and retrieve Arelion's Journal.	Arelion's Journal	My husband, Arelion, had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in Outland. He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things! He went missing in there a few days ago. They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it. One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him. Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal. He always carried it inside a brown knapsack. 
Bring 10 Marks of Kil'jaeden to Adyen the Lightwarden in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Marks of Kil'jaeden	As you probably know, George, the Aldor are keepers of the Light and servants of the naaru. Diametrically opposed to us are the agents of the Burning Legion - demons bent on the destruction of worlds and the corruption of the innocent. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of low-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. We know of a Shadow Council hideout in the Bone Wastes and there are many Legion outposts in Nagrand and the Blade's Edge Mountains. 
Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 10 Netherwing Relics.	The Not-So-Friendly Skies...	On the northeast edge of this island exists a dock used for the packaging and transport of Netherwing crystals and relics. Dragonmaw Transporters transport the goods from the dock to Dragonmaw Fortress while Dragonmaw Ascendants guard the ground from any would-be attackers. This leaves one opening for you to make a strike at the Dragonmaw: The Dragonmaw Skyway. Fly to the shattered islands of the Dragonmaw Skyway and ambush the transporters that use the route. Recover our stolen relics! 
Take the Bundle of Bloodthistle back to Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Bundle of Bloodthistle	I wasn't lying. That egg was incredible. Where did you get it from? Well, if you ever need more bloodthistle, you know where I am and what I need. Here's a bundle of the stuff. Take it back to your benefactor. 
Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 35 Nethermine Flayer Hides.	Nethermine Flayer Hide	A skinner, eh? Well you'll find plenty to skin here! You gotta search for flayers around crystal formations. Take 'em down and take their hides. Sometimes they'll have a hide worth keepin'. Bring those to me. 
Speak with Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.	Visions of Destruction	A vision of cataclysm often disturbs my rest -- a rain of green fire falling to the earth, felling the valiant defenders of a mighty fortress. It has haunted me for weeks now, although I have only recently come to understand its meaning. To the far east, in Shadowmoon Valley, the Wildhammer dwarves endure constant attacks from the Burning Legion and numerous other foes. They fight bravely, but without relief, their enemies will triumph. Go to their side, George. Help them in their fight. 
Break the cursed eggs in Veil Lithic. Redeem 3 Hatchlings and slay 3 Malevolent Hatchlings before returning to Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan.	Veil Lithic: Preemptive Strike	In the wretched colony to the southwest known as Veil Lithic, Terokk's minions are attempting to befoul their avian brethren before they hatch. The dark sorcerers of Lithic encase eggs in a shadowy curse. When the hatchlings emerge, they mindlessly serve Terrok. Travel to Veil Lithic and prematurely break the eggs before the curse has time to seep in. Even if you are too late, you can put down the tainted ones. Remember, the Light shines brightest in the darkness. 
Collect 3 Proto-Nether Drake Essences, 3 Adolescent Drake Essences and 3 Mature Drake Essences. Return with them to Fizit ""Doc"" Clocktock at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	What Came First, the Drake or the Egg?	I'm researching the applications of drake essences to my work as a physician. I think they could be a panacea for a host of maladies! I need someone to go south to the Singing Ridge and get me some. Willing to take my temporal phase modulator and use it on the nether whelps that hatch from the nether drake eggs? Retrieve the essences from whatever they turn into. Which, I might add, I'm not certain of what that will be as we're using some pretty dicey, time and space modifying tech here. 
Grokom Deatheye at Shadowmoon Village wants you to bring him Mazakradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive.	Capture the Weapons	With a larger supply of this material, I can forge a weapon suitable for you. The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. Capturing those two weapons should provide us with enough material to make your weapon, and then some. I can't wait to bring the battle to the enemy using these weapons. That'll teach the Legion to trifle with anti-demon magics. 
Find and speak with Ezekiel of Shattrath in Shattrath City.	Ezekiel	I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. Maladaar has other plans. He has retreated to the Crypt of Remembrance to start his experiments... Necromancy. I hope you weren't thinking about going in there... Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, Human. Got your attention, eh? Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath. 
Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. Use it at the Manaforge B'naar console to shut it down and report back to Anchorite Karja. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar	We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core. According to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs. To perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console. This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information. 
Take Ar'tor's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Cipher of Damnation - The Second Fragment Recovered	I thank you, hero. For without you, my spirit would forever remain in this cursed place.<Ar'tor hands you a spectral lockbox.>Take it and deliver it to my father at the farm, far to the northeast, above Coilskar Cistern... Inside are Lohn'goron and the second part of the cipher. He will be sad to hear news of my death. Promise me that you will assure him that I died a free soul. Tell him that I see the hunting grounds and they are glorious. Tell him that I wait for him there... 
Bring 12 Bonechewer Blood Vials to Vurtok Axebreaker in Thrallmar.	Bonechewer Blood	Bonechewers! They should all die! The sight of their red skin and depravity makes my blood boil! I have a mission for you, George. Kill Bonechewer orcs and collect their vile blood. There is an apothecary who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the demon taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves. Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory, to the south. Return to me when your mission is complete. 
Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to travel to the lava flow near the Ruins of Baa'ri and use the Arcano Control Unit to control an Arcano-Scorp, swim in the lava with the Arcano-Scorp, and tag 8 Greater Felfire Diemetradons.	Frankly, It Makes No Sense...	We must study these creatures further. Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named Gnomus for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion. He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to gnome-kind.<Tiorus gives you a funny look.>I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study. 
Seek out and offer your services to Gahruj. He is located at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	Request for Assistance	While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field. It would appear that the Consortium is having some 'difficulties' in trying to recover property from the blood elves, which they refuse to pay for. Please head east out of Area 52 and cross the bridge to the next island over. You'll find my associate, Gahruj, at the Midrealm Post, just inside of Eco-Dome Midrealm. 
Kill 4 Deathtalon Spirits, 4 Screeching Spirits and 2 Spirit Ravens and return to Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan.	Veil Rhaze: Unliving Evil	Veil Rhaze was a particularly wicked colony of Skettis. Despite the village's eradication by the Auchindoun disaster, Terokk's influence remained in the maligned spirits there. Travel west to Veil Rhaze and slay those murderous wretches. You'll find them to the west of the Shadow Tomb, on the border of Bone Wastes and Terokkar Forest. This will be our first blow against Terokk and the guardians of Skettis. 
Bring 10 Marks of Sargeras to Adyen the Lightwarden in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Marks of Sargeras	By now it should be clear to you why we oppose the Burning Legion and those who serve them. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of high-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. The highest-ranking Legion can be found in Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley. 
Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.	Maintaining the Sunwell Portal	We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereals at Bash'ir Landing have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the Blade's Edge Mountains, far to the north. Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the ethereals and then use it to locate the smuggled goods. Just be cautious of the phase wyrms that they use to guard the mana cells. 
Drink Ahuurn's Elixir while standing in the Boha'mu Ruins. Speak to Elder Kuruti while you are in the form of an arakkoa.	Messenger to the Feralfen	The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins. Once you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers. 
Use the Ceremonial Incense near the candles in Malukaz's hut and observe the ceremony. When the ceremony is complete, speak with Malukaz again.	Welcoming the Wolf Spirit	I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left. I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the wolf spirit after a successful hunt. Once you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony. 
Spiritcaller Dohgar has asked you to use the Orb Collecting Totem to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs. Return to him at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	Gather the Orbs	The Razaani ethereals have strange devices that emit small, pink floating light orbs. They remind me of souls. They are not to be confused with the large yellow balls that break free of the ethereal when they die, these are something else entirely. I'd like for you to head north to Razaan's Landing and drop some totems, which will attact the pink light orbs. Bring them back to me so that I might determine exactly what they are. 
	Identify Plant Parts	 
Make your way to Legion Hold, locate the Legion Communication Device, and learn about the Legion's plans while in disguise. Return to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village when you've completed your mission.	To Legion Hold	The fortress of Legion Hold is your target. You'll have no reinforcements, so a frontal attack is out of the question. What little information we have shows that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and discover their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. 
Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Zealots.	Spectrecles	I call them ""Spectrecles."" Clever, no? When you equip these goggles, you will be able to see the spirits of Shadowmoon Valley. Before I let you have them, though, you must promise me that you will help us clear out the ghosts at the village. Take the goggles and destroy any and all spirits that you see wandering about Shadowmoon Village. Hopefully, destroying these spirits will force any that remain to move elsewhere. 
Poli'lukluk the Wiser at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill 20 Murkblood Scavengers and 10 Murkblood Raiders.	Solving the Problem	The appearance of the Murkblood in Nagrand has had a profound negative impact on our environment. The elementals are all in flux which has, in turn, greatly disturbed the wildlife. Worse yet, the razing of Sunspring Post has reignited the hatred that the orcs held for our people. While the Kurenai are a different tribe than the Murkblood, all an orc sees is Broken. We must make an effort to solve this dilemma. Travel to Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and resolve the Murkblood problem. 
Collect 10 Boxes of Surveying Equipment and return them to Gahruj at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	Rightful Repossession	Our business relations with the blood elves appear to be at an end. A few weeks ago a large shipment of surveying equipment was delivered to them at Manaforge Duro. They have refused to pay for it. George, I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit. They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation. I care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property. 
Use the Fiery Soul Fragment to transform your spirit into a vision guide. Speak with Rokgah Bloodgrip at Thunderlord Stronghold after your vision has guided you to the location of the final Thunderlord relic.	Vision Guide	Human fool. You almost destroyed the drum! I've worked too hard to get here, and my hands have been empty up until now. At least you were able to succeed where the others only met with failure, or worse. It is time to evoke a vision that will lead you to the last relic that I have been seeking. Take this fiery fragment of my soul. Use it to transform your body into flame and denature your spirit into a vision guide that will shoot forth to reveal the location of the final Thunderlord relic. 
Wing Commander Gryphongar at Shatter Point in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.	Mission: The Abyssal Shelf	Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission? This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a gryphon and destroy the whole damned thing! Here are your bombs - now, talk to Gryphoneer Windbellow when you're ready for takeoff. 
Sign Tally's Waiver, then speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. Return to Tally Zapnabber at Toshley's Station.	Test Flight: The Singing Ridge	I've been fiddling with the Zephyrium Capicitorium and I'm ready to perform another test! Do you want to help? This next flight should be short, but fast! Um... and although I'm sure there's no danger... I have this, uh, waiver that I'd like you to sign. It's just a formality, I assure you! Best of luck! Talk to Rally to launch yourself, and come back to me after the experiment is over! 
Collect 10 pieces of Discarded Nutriment and then return to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.	A Question of Gluttony	I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason. This just will not do! I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out! Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings. 
A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to recover Kalithresh's Trident and Murmur's Essence. This quest must be completed in Heroic dungeon difficulty.	Trial of the Naaru: Strength	Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. The trial of strength is divided in two. You must destroy the leader of the Coilfang Steamvaults, Warlord Kalithresh, and bring me his trident. Slay the extra-planar being known as Murmur, in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun, and bring me his essence. Do this and you will have passed the trial of strength. 
Slay the Dark Conclave Ritualists and use the Staff of Parshah to end the Dark Conclave's summoning ritual, then return to Parshah in the Magma Fields.	Thwart the Dark Conclave	The spirits of the dark conclave seek to summon an ancient and powerful evil through a ritual conducted at the lava pits to the south of the Sketh'lon Base Camp. Gul'dan's magic mingled with their own, empowering them to aid this creature in manifesting in our world! We must not allow this to happen, George. The death and destruction it would bring are unimaginable! Carry the staff with you to the site of the summoning and use its magics to stop the dark conclave once and for all! 
Commander Ameer wants you to kill 5 Ethereum Assassins, 5 Ethereum Shocktroopers, 2 Ethereum Researchers and Captain Zovax then activate Ethereum Transponder Zeta.	The Ethereum	Directly south of here you will find the Ethereum Staging Grounds. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something... Perhaps an assault on Ultris. We can't take any chances, though, Mechanic. Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility. Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders. 
Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 10 Shadowmoon Tubers from the Shattered Plains. He also wants Oronok's Boar Whistle back when you're done.	I Was A Lot Of Things...	I've been a lot of things, stranger, but what I once was isn't what's important. What I am now is what matters and what I am now is a farmer. I use trained felboars to dig up tubers from the hardened earth of the Shattered Plains. Recently, though, flayers from a nest to the northeast have been attacking my animals, preventing me from gathering tubers. Would you go to the area north of here and gather tubers for me? Use this whistle while standing on a tuber mound and a boar will come dig one up! 
Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to obtain the Orders from Akama from Oronu the Elder at the Ruins of Baa'ri. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Oronu the Elder	According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri. Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor. We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet. Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan. Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily. Obtain them and bring them to me. 
Speak with Anchorite Barada. Use the prayer beads to help with the ritual, and then speak with Colonel Jules when he is saved. Finally, return to Assistant Klatu.	The Exorcism of Colonel Jules	George, it is time to save Colonel Jules. His condition has worsened and Barada fears that, if we do not cleanse him of his corruption, he will be lost to us. Take the prayer beads you found and speak with Anchorite Barada to begin the ritual. Let no disruptions stop the ritual... and if all goes well, Colonel Jules will be saved. Speak with Jules when he is saved, then return to me. 
Kilrath in Terokkar Forest has asked that you kill 10 Boulderfist Invaders and beat Unkor the Ruthless until he talks.	Don't Kill the Fat One	I have been watching these beasts for days. The fat one says that he is waiting for something. What he is waiting for, however, is a mystery. I have a plan but it is going to involve some violence on your part. You will need to kill several of his subordinates and then beat him within an inch of his life. Do this and I am certain he will tell us everything that we need to know. 
Deliver the Box of Parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.	What Are These Things?	I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are. I do know one thing though - they look dangerous! George, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast. She may have some idea of what these are. 
	Allegiance to the Scryers	 
Find a Bloodmaul Taskmaster and a Bloodmaul Soothsayer engaged in conversation, then use Rexxar's Whistle to summon Spirit to spy on them. When this is complete, return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	On Spirit's Wings	If the Mok'Nathal are tormented by the Bloodmaul ogres, then I will stop them and their followers. Ogres are simple creatures, and there is little profit they could gain from harassing the Mok'Nathal. There must be something more to this. George, take Spirit, my hawk, and spy upon the conversations of the Bloodmaul's leaders. He may go undetected where we cannot. 
Defeat the Warmaul Champion. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion	They had to ship the champion in from the Blade's Edge gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time. If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot? Just give me the word and I'll bet the house on you. Now get in there and win! 
Ikuti wants you to kill Overlord Gorefist and 10 Ango'rosh Maulers. Return to the Orebor Harborage once you have completed the task.	Overlord Gorefist	The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next. Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom. Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite. 
Scout Navrin wants you to travel to the Netherweb Ridge and free 6 Webbed Sha'tar Warriors and then return to him at Sha'tar Outpost.	Taken in the Night	Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the Bone Wastes. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders. We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders. Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people? 
Severin wants you to venture into Skettis and retrieve 6 Shadow Dusts from the arakkoa that dwell there.	World of Shadows	Sky Commander Adaris was seriously injured during a Skettis incursion. He's been in and out of consciousness since. I fear he has succumbed to a feverish delirium. During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa. He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a ""world of shadows"" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell. I do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir. Will you help? 
Use the Fistful of Feathers on the Lashh'an Spell Circle, then return to Daranelle at Sylvanaar before the kaliri spirit fades.	Scratches	The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the circles of power in Veil Lashh. Confusing iconography seems to show an arakkoa being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri. 
Find 6 Ruuan'ok Claws and use them at the Ruaan'ok Oracle Circle to summon a Harbinger of the Raven. Kill it and return its Harbinger's Pendant to Timeon at Ruuan Weald.	Creating the Pendant	The arakkoa of Ruaan Weald elevate from their flock the Harbingers of the Raven, the heralds of their god. They believe that the Harbingers watch over them from the sky, where they receive the teachings of the Raven, and descend to pass this message along. The Harbingers hold a powerful sway over the souls of the arakkoa. They use magical pendants, which we need. Attract one of the Harbingers by slaying its flock and taking their claws. Place the claws upon the altar to get his attention. 
Wear the Felsworn Gas Mask and use the Legion Communicator at Forge Camp: Anger.	Felsworn Gas Mask	I have a very special mission for you, George. I need you to infiltrate Forge Camp: Anger east of here. When you enter the camp you will need to wear the Felsworn gas mask and locate the Legion communicator. Once you have located the communication device speak with whomever is on the other side of the device. If all works out you can trick the demon into something devious! Try telling the demon that camp anger has revolted. Good luck to you Mechanic. 
Klatu in Honor Hold wants you to use the Anchorite Relic at Gor'gaz Outpost southwest of Honor Hold, slay Shattered Hand Berserkers near the relic, and then slay 10 released Fel Spirits to avenge Colonel Jules.	Fel Spirits	Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for Shattered Hand fel orcs. My master, Barada, works feverishly to cure the poor human, but he needs help. The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance. Take this anchorite relic to Gor'gaz Outpost. Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them. This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery. 
Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy Watoosun's Polluted Essence and 10 Lake Surgers.	The Spirit Polluted	Watoosun was able to shed the stink of corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. A spirit essence composed of the vilest corruption found amongst the elements! You will find this polluted spirit of the swamp southwest of here, hidden in the depths of Lake Sunspring. Find and destroy the polluted essence of Watoosun and any corrupt offspring that it may have created. 
Kill 10 Ango'rosh Ogres and 5 Ango'rosh Shaman and return to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage.	Ango'rosh Encroachment	The small band of Broken you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in Nagrand. The Kurenai, as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our draenei brothers. My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of Telredor. If the Ango'rosh ogres have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the Hewn Bog of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy. 
Obtain Grulloc's Sack and deliver it to Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	A Boaring Time for Grulloc	George, I have a pet boar named Huffer. He wants to help you to have some fun with one of the nearby sons of Gruul. Grulloc inhabits a place known as the Cursed Hollow. When you get there, let Huffer loose. The gronn will have a fine time chasing him around, and you will retrieve the bag that he guards and deliver it to Baron Sablemane. To get to the Cursed Hollow, head down the northern ramp and east through Dragons' End. The hollow is on the eastern edge. 
	More Warbeads!	 
Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell in Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.	Hellfire Fortifications	The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces. We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them. To do that, we need forward staging areas. Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel. We want you to help secure these forts. Capture each fort, and then report back to me. May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, George, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications. 
Apothecary Zelana at Reaver's Fall wants you to speak with Wing Commander Brack to take a wyvern to Spinebreaker Post, and then bring the Bleeding Hollow Blood Sample to Apothecary Albreck at Spinebreaker Post.	Spinebreaker Post	George, my equipment here is, unfortunately, not configured for all the tests I'd like to perform. However, my colleague at Spinebreaker Post, Apothecary Albreck, possesses the required implements. I have acquired a sample of Bleeding Hollow blood -- gained from a past mission of Thrallmar's agents. Take the sample to Albreck and allow him to study it. To reach Spinebreaker Post, speak with Wing Commander Brack, near the wyverns to the south. 
Use Bleeding Hollow Blood at the Cursed Cauldron to make Boiled Blood. Bring 12 Boiled Blood to Apothecary Albreck at Spinebreaker Post.	Boiling Blood	That last experiment was not a complete loss -- I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me. Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the Bleeding Hollow witches placed on their people's blood. I need more for study. Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the orcs in Zeth'Gor. When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it. Bring me the boiled blood. 
Defeat the Murkblood Twins that call themselves the Blue Brothers. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: The Blue Brothers	This next battle involves a duo - twin brothers to be precise. They call themselves the ""Blue Brothers.""It's not too late to chicken out, George. I'd certainly understand. But if you're ready for some action, step in the Ring of Blood and wait for the Murkblood twins to arrive. Last one standing is the winner! 
Speak with Sergeant Shatterskull at the Supply Caravan just outside of Thrallmar, to the east.	Eradicate the Burning Legion	Though this land is full of strange new enemies, the Burning Legion is still the greatest threat to our Expedition. One of my most trusted warriors, Sergeant Shatterskull, has been studying the Legion's tactics - trying to discern the demons' true purpose in this land. Seek him out at the supply caravan just outside the southern wall. And George - be wary of the Legion. Their evil cannot be underestimated. 
Use the Wicked Strong Fetish to curse 5 buildings or towers in Bladespire Hold and 2 in Bloodmaul Outpost. Return to T'chali the Witch Doctor at Bloodmaul Ravine in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	A Curse Upon Both of Your Clans!	T'chali wants revenge on all of the ogres! T'chali was a powerful witch doctor in life. If you reach into me grave you will find a wicked strong fetish. Invoke the fetish's magic at the entrances to the buildings and towers of both Bladespire Hold and Bloodmaul Outpost. The voodoo you work will summon an evil spirit that you must defeat. This in turn will curse that building. Beware, if you attempt to curse a building that is already cursed, you will call down another cursed spirit! 
Deliver news of your mission along with the Dragonmaw Flare Gun to Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.	Kill Them All!	Commander George, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Scryers' outpost located at the foot of the Netherwing Fields. With the Sanctum of the Stars destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Eclipse Point and Illidari Point will once more be open. Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack! 
Seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post.	Seek Out Ameer	It would seem that an outside force has taken an interest in the business practices of the Consortium. Five Consortium dealers have gone missing in the past two days. We have reason to believe the Ethereum are involved. If you are interested in assisting, seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post. You will find the Protectorate Watch Post directly east of here on the next island. 
Kill Lord Klaq and return to Windcaller Blackhoof at the Cenarion Refuge.	Safeguarding the Watchers	In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species. The safety of the watchers is paramount, Mechanic. We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore Funggor Cavern to the south, because of marshbeast attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks. 
Slay Mragesh and return to Zurjaya in Zabra'jin.	The Biggest of Them All	You've dealt with most of the little hydra, but I doubt Mragesh was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time. I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of Serpent Lake, to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet. 
Reach Neutral with Sporeggar.	An Outside Perspective	Thank you for everything you have done for my people, but they are still scared of outsiders. Fight the bog lords and rescue the spore sacs in the Spawning Glen. The future of my people is at stake! 
Wait for David Wayne to finish forging a sword for you.	Bane of the Illidari	<David gathers his smithing supplies.>You've done well in getting everything we'll need to reforge the anti-demon blade. Your hard work and dedication is about to be repaid. The time has come to forge the sword. 
Speak to Amythiel Mistwalker at Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Warning the Cenarion Circle	The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy. These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle. Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula. 
The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover 15 pieces of Ethereum Relay Data.	Potential for Brain Damage = High	They're using relays to transfer information around the staging grounds. There is only one way for you to see these relays and extract the information they hold. Unfortunately, doing so may cause you irreparable brain damage. If you're still interested, you'll need to slay Ethereum here at the staging grounds and take their essences. Once you have an essence, drink it down. It will temporarily allow you to see an Ethereum relay - giving you enough time to destroy a relay and extract its information. 
Find and convince Empoor to tell you what he knows.	By Any Means Necessary	I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues. Empoor is a Broken merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information. If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say. He travels the road here between Tuurem and Shattrath. Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard. 
Bring 10 Glowcaps to Msshi'fn at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.	Glowcap Mushrooms	I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need. We're not so different from you. We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency. Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them. I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves. What do you say, George? 
Bring 10 Marshfang Slicer Blades to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.	The Sharpest Blades	The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades. It turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me. 
Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Stormrage Missive.	To Catch A Thistlehead	<Borak takes the bundle of bloodthistle from you and places it to his nose.>Pungent...Now, take this bundle and place it at the other end of this bridge. When the envoy makes his daily rounds, he will be compelled to pick it up - without his bodyguard. You see, blood elves look down upon bloodthistle addicts. If any of his compatriots ever found out...All you need to do is lie in wait for him to dismiss his bodyguard. When he is alone, make your strike! Kill him and take the missive. 
Retrieve Maggoc's Treasure Chest and deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Maggoc's Treasure Chest	On the Razor Ridge, above and to the southeast, Maggoc patrols. His father assigned him as the warden of the eastern mountain range, and he revels in terrorizing any creature that gets in his way. As a son of Gruul, he must be done away with if my clan is to survive. That's where you come in. Maggoc carries a treasure chest with him at all times. Prove to me that he has been slain by bringing me his precious chest. Feel free to keep whatever you find within it. 
Speak with Neltharaku and listen to his story.	Neltharaku's Tale	I have information that you may find useful. Please listen to what I have to tell you, Human. 
Seek out Karynaku at Dragonmaw Fortress.	Karynaku	It shames me to ask for your assistance once more, George, but you are my flight's only hope. Without my mate, the netherwing brood may die out completely. Make your way to the top of Dragonmaw Fortress and find Karynaku. We will be flying overhead. Should a break appear in their defenses, the might of the netherwing will swoop down to assist you. 
Take the Burning Blade Peace Offering to Arechron at Telaar.	Message to Telaar	<Lantresor points to an unmarked crate.>Take it. It is my offering to your people. You have single-handedly saved my clan from extermination. You may tell your leader that Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace.<Lantresor bows.> 
Arechron wants you to find Corki at Warmaul Hill.	Corki's Ransom	<Arechron shows you a grime covered letter.>I just received this letter. It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of Nagrand. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, George? I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop. 
Collect 15 Mushroom Samples and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.	Familiar Fungi	Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh! To the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog. Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there. I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis. Just be careful, Mechanic. I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them. Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food? 
Use the Cenarion Antidote on a Hulking Helboar and observe the results. Once you have the results of the experiment, return to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Testing the Antidote	I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind! It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do. Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species. 
Razak Ironsides has asked you to gather up 5 Extra Sharp Daggermaw Teeth. Return them to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Cutting Your Teeth	It's nice that you've been helping out Toshley and his scientists. I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests. If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons. Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup. The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the Razor Ridge make for great vibro-weapon blades. Scare me up some. 
Sky Commander Keller has asked you to acquire Dragon Teeth and return them to him at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	To Rule The Skies	As ye've flown around, ye must have noticed the dragons above. I trust ye haven't fallen victim ta their rage. Help us put an end ta it, George! Rivendark and Obsidia lord over this terrace, while Insidion and Furywing rule the skies over yon terrace ta the northeast. Each has a perch on their respective domains. I be wondering if ye and yer friends will go ta one, <lad/lass>, break open an egg and attract the dragon down. Bring me some teeth as proof. Ta rule the skies, it's either them or us. 
Collect 10 Zaxxis Insignias and return them to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	A Heap of Ethereals	There is something else that I want your help with. A group of ethereals, known as the Zaxxis, have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves. They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves. This will not be tolerated! I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south. But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to Area 52. Mechanic, go down there and bring back their insignias. Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards. 
Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.	Kill the Shadow Council!	What! Those guys are Shadow Council?!George, you have to go back in there and waste them! I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can. After you're done with that, report back to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold. Good luck, Mechanic! 
Use the Diagnostic Device while standing near the Eco-Dome Sutheron Generator and bring the Diagnostic Results back to Ghabar at the Stormspire.	Diagnosis: Critical	If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble. I do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely. To be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome. 
Bring the Uncatalogued Species to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Uncatalogued Species	Lauranna must've missed this particular plant. You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work. You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it. 
Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold to destroy the infernals, then report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.	Blast the Infernals!	The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power. If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals. 
Visit Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower where Chort is standing, just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Mog'dorg the Wizened	Mog'dorg the Wizened waits for you at top of da tower. He tells me to look for a Human Mechanic just like you. You go speak with him about smart things. Go now, but don't tell no one. It's a secret! 
Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy the Large Hut, the Western Hut, the Southern Hut and the Eastern Hut at Windyreed Village. Return the Living Fire to Elementalist Lo'ap when the task is complete.	Blessing of Incineratus	The wretched Lost Ones, heretofore banished to the swamps of Zangarmarsh, are seeking to spread their filth to other parts of our world. I have sought the wisdom of the furies and gained their blessing. To stop the source, we must unleash the elements upon them! I give you living fire, plucked from the fiery essence of Incineratus himself. Travel to Windyreed Village, southeast of here, and unleash the living fire upon their huts! Let them see the fury of the elements! 
While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. Then return to Scout Neftis at Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.	Who Are They?	I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile! I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor. Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another. 
Seek out Oronok Torn-heart on the Shattered Shelf - north of Coilskar Cistern.	Oronok Torn-heart	I do not know how we can acquire the spell that the spirits mentioned, George. Truth be told, I don't even know where we would start such a search.<Torlok stares off in the distance, lost in thought.>Hrm... It is a long shot but it might be our only chance. There is an orc that I have seen visit this area before. I spoke to him briefly once. He is a hermit that claims to live above Coilskar Cistern to the northeast. Seek out this orc, Oronok Torn-heart. As I said, it is a long shot. 
Kill Doomcryer and report back to Wildlord Antelarion in Evergrove.	You're Fired!	Doomcryer did nothing to stop the revolt? How dare she! She has been trying to undermine my authority for some time. However, this time will be her last. You must summon her and deal with her personally. Her anger guards hold the keys that summon her to Forge Camp: Anger. Retrieve the five keys and activate the five Legion obelisks. The obelisks have a short duration, so make sure they are all activated at the same time. Remember, the anger guards carry more keys. 
Mo'mor the Breaker at Telaar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 25 Boulderfist Warriors and 25 Boulderfist Mages.	The Twin Clefts of Nagrand	You made a strong showing, George. Are you ready for more? I have received reports of a large contingent of Boulderfist ogres hidden in the twin clefts of Nagrand, northwest of here in the Halaani Basin. Venture forth to the clefts and deal with the remaining Boulderfist ogres. 
Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the second triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to Wind Trader Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing, just on the other side of the bridge from the Manaforge Ara island in the Netherstorm.	Triangulation Point Two	I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point. You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second. All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west. Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents. He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on. 
	Voranaku the Violet Netherwing Drake	 
Puluu at the Orebor Harborage wants you to kill 12 Marshfang Slicers.	Lines of Communication	One of the reasons Ikuti led us to Zangarmarsh was to help open the lines of communication between the draenei and the Kurenai home city of Telaar in Nagrand. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads must be secured. On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers. 
Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch wants you to go to the Great Fissure in Hellfire Peninsula and light the Southern Beacon, Western Beacon and Central Beacon. Return to him with the Lit Torch after you've completed this task.	Marking the Path	With the rock flayer population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims. Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east. Light the three beacons and return to me. Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them. 
A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to rescue Millhouse Manastorm from the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep. This quest must be completed in Heroic dungeon difficulty.	Trial of the Naaru: Tenacity	Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. In our travels we have encountered many dangerous beings. Some of these beings we incarcerated and placed in what is now known as the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep. There is one prisoner, however, that is a victim of circumstance. A stowaway who was in the wrong naaru vessel at the wrong time. Venture to the Arcatraz and rescue the gnome, Millhouse Manastorm. Ensure his survival. 
Speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander Kingston at Expedition Point.	Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways	Just west of the Dark Portal are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into rubble! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52. Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee -- he'll put you on a gryphon and send you on your way. 
Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to Deliver Illidan's Message to Grand Commander Ruusk at Eclipse Point.	What Illidan Wants, Illidan Gets...	Take this disguise and enter Eclipse Point. Once inside, use the disguise to cloak yourself. The Eclipsion blood elves will be unable to see through the disguise, thereby granting you safe passage to Grand Commander Ruusk. Once you find Ruusk, tell him where next to move the cipher. You're going to have to act your heart out, George. Play it off as if you are his superior, delivering a message from his lord. That should do it! Oh - watch out for the dragonhawks as they see through the disguise. 
Elkay'gan the Mystic at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to use the Mag'har Battle Standard at the First Burning Blade Pyre, Second Burning Blade Pyre, and Third Burning Blade Pyre. Return the left-over Mag'har Battle Standards to him when you are finished.	Standards and Practices	If you're venturing into the Burning Blade Ruins, I have a task for you. Take these Mag'har battle standards and place them at three distinct locations in the ogre compound. An area of high visibility is recommended. Look for the gigantic flaming pyres on the upper levels. Place a standard near the first, second, and third Burning Blade pyres. The standard will leave a lasting impression upon any ogres who may have missed the battle. 
Mo'mor the Breaker at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill 15 Boulderfist Crushers and 15 Boulderfist Mystics.	The Ruins of Burning Blade	These ogre hunting parties are a precursor to invasion. We must strike at them before they have a chance to amass an army big enough to take over our town. You're going to need to get your hands dirty, Human. The largest collection of Boulderfist in this region can be found at the Burning Blade Ruins, almost directly east of Telaar, near the border of Terokkar. Go there and show the Boulderfist that Telaar will not bend to their will! 
Sit back and enjoy the ride. Speak to Altruis when the survey is complete.	Survey the Land	To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. Nethrandamus will take you through the Legion camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes. Primarily, I want you to note what structures are in the camps and what comprises the camps' defenses. Nethrandamus is ready when you are, George. Do not be afraid, he will keep you safe from harm. 
Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to explore the Boha'mu Ruins.	The Boha'mu Ruins	Before my people were decimated by the orcs, Telredor served as a retreat for draenei anchorites and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and vindicators maintained a number of shrines in this region. During the war, we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a tribe of Lost Ones has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the Boha'mu Ruins and tell me of what you find there. 
Speak with Wing Commander Brack, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall.	Mission: Gateways Murketh and Shaadraz	We've identified the two main transporters that the Burning Legion are using to bring in reinforcements: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into oblivion! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52. Now, speak with Wing Commander Brack -- he'll put you on a wyvern. 
Kill Grillok Darkeye and bring Grillok's Eyepatch to Zezzak in Spinebreaker Post.	"Grillok ""Darkeye"""	Grillok Darkeye has wagered a piece of himself to dark powers, and gained great magic for it. His lost eye burns deep in some hellish pit, now a demon's trinket... and the patch that covers his betrayal holds its own dark secrets. Bring me Grillok's eyepatch, George, and I will reward you greatly for your service... 
The Evergrove Druid has told you that the final thing you must do is to slay Baelmon the Hound-Master. Afterward, return to Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains, and inform Wildlord Antelarion of your success.	The Hound-Master	Baelmon the Hound-Master must die! He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning. The Death's Door portal is located at the north end of the canyon. When you find it, you will find Baelmon. You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand. When you battle the Hound-Master, use it and a couple of my friends will come to your aid. After you have defeated Baelmon, return to Wildlord Antelarion. And, George, thank you for all that you've gone through for us here. 
Recover Naberius's Phylactery from Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard district and bring it to Custodian Dieworth.	Capturing the Phylactery	I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named Naberius. He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, Naberius seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense. Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain. 
Warden Bullrok at Garadar wants you to obtain 10 Obsidian Warbeads from the various ogres that inhabit Nagrand.	Proving Your Strength	Though we seek a peaceful life, our enemies are many. Of these, none match the ogres in sheer brute power. If you seek to prove your prowess to us, bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks. I will tell others of your accomplishments. 
Retrieve Scout Jyoba's Report from the Withered Giants and return it to Zurai at Swamprat Post.	Jyoba's Report	Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report. Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai. 
Voren'thal the Seer in Shattrath City wants you to obtain an Arcane Tome. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	Synthesis of Power	Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters. There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune. Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune. Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need. In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up. 
The Spirit of Ar'tor at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart from the demons of the area.	Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart	It is a sign, George. Even in death, I cannot be stopped. Recovering a part of the Cipher of Damnation is my destiny. With your help, that destiny will be fulfilled. Before we embark on that journey, I must have my longbow, Lohn'goron. It is a family heirloom that has been handed down from Torn-heart to Torn-heart for generations. My instinct tells me that a demon stole it from my corpse. Kill the demons here until you find my bow. 
Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge north of Eclipse Point wants you to find a Rotten Arakkoa Egg and deliver it to Tobias the Filth Gorger in Shattrath City, located in northwest Terokkar Forest.	Of Thistleheads and Eggs...	I'd have given up had I not noticed... He's a Thistlehead. I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there...Now if we could get our hands on some bloodthistle, we'd be in business. In my travels, I met a shady Broken in Shattrath named Tobias. Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to blood elves for rotten arakkoa eggs. Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins. Search them for an egg and head to the lower city of Shattrath. That's where you'll find Tobias. 
Kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Warp-Scryer Kryv in the main keep of Honor Hold.	The Heart of Darkness	It is just as I feared. Arix'Amal - the demon you killed earlier, was working for a secret Legionlord - Arazzius the Cruel. It appears this new villain has amassed a force of hellish terrorfiends near the Pools of Aggonar. You must journey there and slay the terrorfiends before they strike against us. But be wary, friend - the Pools of Aggonar lie within a tortured, poisonous valley. You can find the cursed pools to the northwest of here, beyond Hellfire Citadel. Light be with you, George. 
Skyguard Khatie has asked you to wrangle 5 Aether Rays. After you have done so, return them to her at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Wrangle Some Aether Rays!	Wanna help the Skyguard and Ogri'la? Just hear me out before you walk away, <hot stuff/girly>. We're in need of remounts! The bombing runs and missions to Bash'ir Landing have taken a toll on our mounts. The aether rays that fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast, look like they'd do just fine. You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice. Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later. Think you can wrangle me up some? 
Kill Bladespire ogres to get the Wyvern Cage Key. Once you have it, go to the Wyvern Cage and use Spirit's Whistle to summon Spirit, who will unlock the cage. After Leokk is free, return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Prisoner of the Bladespire	Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres. Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of Gruul's lair. One of the ogres must carry his key. Find it and Spirit can use it to unlock Leokk's cage. You will find the encampment at the north end of the Daggermaw Canyon down below. 
Search for the missing Mag'hari procession.	Missing Mag'hari Procession	Greatmother says that we must press on and serve our people. She says that we must serve as an example for Garrosh - to show that life goes on. I have so many matters to attend to here, especially with Greatmother having taken ill. Would you honor the Mag'har by helping one of their matrons? Several days ago we sent a funeral procession to the Ancestral Grounds and they have yet to return. Will you go search for them? They took the western road out of Garadar. Follow it around and avoid Halaa. 
Speak with Rally Zapnabber and use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. Return to Tally Zapnabber at Toshley's Station.	Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium	I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but... do you want to help me test it? There's plenty of hazard pay! Speak with my twin over there, Rally. Good luck, George. Come back after your experiment. Or... if that's not possible due to sustained injuries, your next of kin can report to collect your pay. 
Speak to Akama inside the hidden chamber in the Warden's Cage.	Akama	You've proven what side you're on. I will reveal to you our leader's hideout. Follow the halls beyond; there will be an underground passage hidden by stagnant water on your right. I must warn you, George. You are not to speak to anyone of what you see there. 
The Evergrove Druid has asked you to collect 5 Fel Cannonballs. Once you have done so, use the Druid Signal to call to the Evergrove Druid inside of Death's Door at the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Harvesting the Fel Ammunition	We must shut down the Burning Legion's access to Death's Door, but first you're going to destroy their two warp-gates! The problem is, we can't even scratch one of those things, so you're going to need to use their own weapons against them. The death's might, death's watch, deathforge over-smiths and deathforge technicians carry the ammunition for the fel cannons. Normally it wouldn't affect any of them, but if you bring the cannonballs to me, I will imbue them with Nature's unbridled wrath! 
Magistrix Carinda wants you to interrogate Magister Aledis, last seen traveling from Falcon Watch to Zangarmarsh.	Arelion's Secret	Arelion's journal does not deal with any sort of scholarly studies. It details his escapades with a young female blood elf! How could I've been such a fool? Unfortunately, the floozy's identity is not revealed in this journal. Aledis, a colleague of Arelion's, was his best friend and confidant. Go question him and find out who he was having this affair with. I saw Aledis leave Falcon Watch for Zangarmarsh. Follow the road headed north from town; it'll eventually lead west, toward Zangarmarsh. 
Bring 10 Obsidian Warbeads to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.	Obsidian Warbeads	All this waiting around for Oshu'gun to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, George. Fortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income. The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds. Zerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security. Think of the warbeads as an added bonus. Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me. 
Collect 10 pieces of Ethereal Technology and return them to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Pick Your Part	Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that. But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim! The Heap to the south is ours! If we're to finish the X-52 Nether-Rocket, we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on. And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind. Why don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses! 
Speak to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage.	The Orebor Harborage	As you know, many of Telredor's inhabitants are refugees from the war that decimated the draenei. It is my goal to maintain Telredor as a safe haven for all of our allies in this struggle. There are some who desire to join us, but feel they are not yet ready. We owe them whatever help we can provide, George. A group of Broken under the leadership of Ikuti have taken shelter in the ruins of an old temple to the northwest of Serpent Lake. Seek them out and extend your hand in friendship to them. 
Kill 10 Mire Hydra and return to Haalrun at Telredor.	Too Many Mouths to Feed	On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too. If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food. For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed! 
Bring 12 Timber Worg Pelts to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold.	Vestments of the Wolf Spirit	Generations ago, when orc clans still called Terokkar Forest home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind. In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest. I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home. 
Kill 10 Fenclaw Thrashers and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.	Angling to Beat the Competition	It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland. Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake. Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything! 
Defeat Rokdar the Sundered Lord. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: Rokdar the Sundered Lord	This fight is gonna be painful, George. Do you have any friends that are brave enough to help you out? The ogres managed to get a giant from Blade's Edge named Rokdar! Trust me, you're gonna need friends, he seems unbeatable! He's hard as a rock - literally! If you still want to fight him, step into the Ring of Blood and he will come. 
Vindicator Haylen wants you to kill the Terokkarantula and then return to him west of Netherweb Ridge.	Terokkarantula	You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again. Deep within Netherweb Ridge is the lair of the Terokkarantula, the brood-mother of these gruesome creatures. If we are to be safe, she must die. 
Wildlord Antelarion has implored you to travel to Death's Door. Once you arrive there, use the Druid Signal to call down an Evergrove Druid so that you can speak with them.	Death's Door	Now there is an even greater threat from the Burning Legion. To the south is a portal known as Death's Door, which opens upon the horrific world where the Legion breeds its deadly hounds. To get there, exit Evergrove by heading east up the ramp. Follow the path south, through the Bladed Gulch, Razaan's Landing, Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf. Then, take the ramp down into the Vekhaar Stand and enter Death's Door through the tunnel, south of Mok'Nathal. Once there, use this druid signal. 
Speak with A'dal in Shattrath City.	A Secret Revealed	As my energies bled away over the centuries, a void slowly grew in my place - devouring the souls of those nearby. Helplessly, I watched as generations of orc souls were drawn into the vortex. Recently, my enemies harnessed the vortex and used it to draw countless void minions into their Burning Legion. Now, the key to ending this cycle and freeing the orc spirits lies with another naaru - A'dal. I have sensed his essence within the ancient city of Shattrath in the Terokkar Forest. 
	Jorus the Cobalt Netherwing Drake	 
Mar'nah at Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to travel to Razorthorn Rise in Outlands, collect 5 Razorthorn Roots, and return to her.	Rediscovering Your Roots	My stocks are presently sufficient, but I'll need plenty of razorthorn roots to keep up with the demand. Collecting the roots is difficult, but I know a special method of extraction. Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root. To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise. Return to me, George, once you have collected five of the roots. 
Recover the Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 1, Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 2, and Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 3 from the Dark Conclave arakkoa at the Sketh'lon Wreckage to Sergeant Kargrul at Shadowmoon Village.	The Sketh'lon Wreckage	The Sketh'lon Wreckage, just to the east, is an eerie place. The peons are convinced that it's cursed. There are few trees here, so the peons have no choice but to venture into the arakkoa ruins to chop wood. The arakkoa spirits prey on the work groups, draining their life and using it to fuel their foul magics. We must find out what is driving the dark conclave and stop them before their influence expands. Search the Sketh'lon Wreckage for evidence of their plans. 
Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to search the Deathforge for Kagrosh and recover Kagrosh's Pack.	The Fate of Kagrosh	The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero. He descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since. In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected. 
Deliver the news to Farseer Corhuk at Garadar.	He Will Walk The Earth...	Will you do me one last honor, George? I do not wish to return to Garadar. I believe that my destiny lies elsewhere - that I will serve a greater purpose someday. Please, return to Farseer Corhuk and tell him that I will not be returning. That I cannot return. I must walk the earth... He will understand. 
Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to use the Damp Woolen Blanket at the Blazing Warmaul Pyre in the Laughing Skull Courtyard to signal his ogres.	Body of Evidence	Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place. Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers. That should be the final straw! 
Slay Zorbo the Advisor, 10 Warmaul Shaman and 10 Warmaul Reavers. Return to Warden Bullrok if you manage to complete this task.	WANTED: Zorbo the Advisor	Wanted: Dead or AliveZorbo the Advisor, wanted for numerous planned attacks on Garadar. Along with his reavers and shaman, Zorbo has slain countless orcs. Consider Zorbo as armed, dangerous, and merciless. Zorbo makes his home in the Laughing Skull Ruins in the northern mountains of Nagrand. Reward for Zorbo the Advisor's death or capture to be dispensed by Warden Bullrok at Garadar. 
	Another Heap of Ethereals	 
Escort the Captured Protectorate Vanguard back to Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.	Escape from the Staging Grounds	Thank K'aresh! He would have torn me apart! I'm a Protectorate soldier, fleshling. My platoon was sent on a recon mission about 10 days ago. As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of Ethereum jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked void. Only Tyralius was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell. I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back? 
T'chali the Witch Doctor has asked you to kill his chief tormentors, Grimnok Battleborn and Korgaah. After you have done so, return to him at Bloodmaul Ravine in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Grimnok and Korgaah, I Am For You!	T'chali has been waiting for his revenge! The day they bury T'chali and leave him to die, it was Grimnok Battleborn that led them. And the next day it was Korgaah that come south to raid and kick T'chali in the head. I want them dead! You will find Grimnok atop the Southmaul Tower in Bloodmaul Outpost. You will find Korgaah in the top of a building at the north end of Bladespire Hold. Korgaah has sober defenders, so use the brew to distract him away from them, because they won't drink. 
Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 5 Watery Souls.	Enraged Spirits of Water	The Illidari naga of the region have taken control of the only clean water supply that exists in Shadowmoon Valley. Directly north of here you will find the lair of the naga: Coilskar. Around Coilskar are pockets of agitated water that howl to the land in anguish. It is at those pockets that the enraged spirits of water now wander. Travel to Coilskar and use the totem of spirits to capture watery souls. You will find the largest concentration of these spirits near Coilskar Cistern. 
Take Grom'tor's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Cipher of Damnation - The First Fragment Recovered	<Grom'tor wraps the documents up and places them in a lockbox.>Take this box to father. He awaits your return at the farm, northeast of here. Tell him that I will be home soon. As soon as I am done having my fun... 
Take the Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv in the main keep of Honor Hold.	The Dark Missive	The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the draenei mystic, Kryv. Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold. 
Speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened. He stands atop the tower on the east side of the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Speak with Mog'dorg	<King/Queen> George! You speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened before you leave and go to Ogri'la! 
Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you destroy 15 Tortured Earth Spirits.	The Tortured Earth	Bring up the usurper. You will find him. Follow earthen path. First you put to rest tortured earth spirits. Must sleep once more.<Gordawg smashes his fist into the ground and brings up very foul smelling soil.>Must sleep!<Gordawg points southeast.>Find spirits near mountains. Near hills. Near rocks. Near earth. Put to sleep. Telaari Basin... Southeast. 
Travel to Manaforge Ara and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from Overseer Azarad. Use it at the Manaforge Ara console to shut it down. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Shutting Down Manaforge Ara	One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional. After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up. Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down. The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad. Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges. You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends. 
Reach Friendly with Sporeggar.	A Friendly Gesture	Life in the marsh has not been easy, George. We want to live in harmony with those that call it home, but our enemies out here threaten our existence. Work with us. Help the people of Sporeggar thrive. 
Use the Shabby Arakkoa Disguise to obtain the Adversarial Bloodlines from Sahaak and return to Hazzik.	A Shabby Disguise	Open the package, George. It is a disguise. It doesn't look very convincing, does it? I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books. There is an arakkoa scribe who dwells in the central island in Skettis, Terokk's Rest; his name is Sahaak. He is old and nearly blind. Use the disguise to speak with him and obtain the book known as the Adversarial Bloodlines. Be careful, George. The disguise won't fool the other arakkoa. 
Slay Arix'Amal. Take the Burning Legion Gate Key. Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the Rune of Spite.	Invasion Point: Annihilator	Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - Invasion Point: Annihilator. It lies northwest of Forge Camp: Rage - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements! You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down! 
Bring the Box of Ingots to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge in Terokkar Forest.	The Hermit Smith	<The orc shakes his head at his failure.>This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated. It pains me to suggest this, but your only hope may be a human smith by the name of David Wayne. It's true he was once a member of the Alliance's expedition, but that was a long time ago and he has since left the Sons of Lothar. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you. 
	The Eye of Haramad	 
Take the information that you beat out of Unkor to Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand.	Because Kilrath is a Coward	Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar. I can assure you that he won't be happy to know that our village was destroyed and many of our people killed because the ogres needed more space. May the ancestors watch over you... I will be hiding in the bushes if you need me for anything else. 
High Priest Orglum wants you to journey to the Tomb of Lights and kill 10 Ethereal Nethermancers and 10 Ethereal Plunderers and then return to him by the Refugee Caravan.	The Tomb of Lights	To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead. Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits. Little did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil. Even now the ethereals plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago. There is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive. 
Lakotae wants you to kill 25 Wood Mites and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. The mites can be found living inside the bodies of Rotting Forest-Ragers and Infested Root-Walkers.	The Infested Protectors	The trees of this land are ravaged by the power that was unleashed from Auchindoun. The foul magic that was unleashed blasted the land into the wastes you see all around. The trees that survived are now infested with wretched wood mites that crawl under their bark and gnaw at their flesh. Rotting forest-rages and infested root-walkers are breeding grounds for the mites. They are found along the edge of the wood to the east. Destroy these creatures and then kill the mites that flee their husks. 
Torkus has asked you to obtain an Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer for him. Return with it to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	A Father's Duty	As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing. It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain. Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask? Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it. The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing. Thank you for doing this, George. It'll mean the world to our sons! 
Slay Giselda the Crone and any combination of 15 Kil'sorrow Agents. Return to Warden Bullrok at Garadar should you complete this task.	WANTED: Giselda the Crone	Wanted: Dead or AliveGiselda the Crone of Kil'sorrow and her lackeys for murder, ritual sacrifice, communing with the Legion, kidnapping, and burglary. Known to congregate at Kil'sorrow Fortress in southeastern Nagrand, near the border of Terokkar. Large gold reward to be dispensed by Warden Bullrok at Garadar to anyone able to bring Giselda to justice. 
Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold.	The Elusive Ironjaw	Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest! I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked. He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed. 
Obtain 5 Condensed Nether Gas from Gan'arg Mekgineers at Forge Base: Oblivion, northwest of the Stormspire, and load them into a nearby Inactive Fel Reaver. Return to Nether-Stalker Nauthis after you've completed this task.	Fel Reavers, No Thanks!	Ah, yes - the fel reaver! Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation. There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the Stormspire. Fortunately for us, they are not active yet. This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force. Obtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it. I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well. 
Ishanah wants you to go to the Arakkoa outpost east of Shattrath City and use the Blessed Vial to cleanse the Eastern Altar, the Western Altar and the Northern Altar. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Restoring the Light	Much of this region was inhabited by draenei long ago. We Aldor were charged with the safeguarding of our holy sites and altars. Many of them have since been destroyed or taken over by our enemies. To the east of here there is an arakkoa outpost. It was purposefully built on the location of three of our sacred altars. The arakkoa use their foul magic to warp and defile the innate power of our shrines. Take this to the arakkoa outpost and use it to cleanse the three altars. 
Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 6 pieces of Eclipsion Armor.	The Shadowmoon Shuffle	<Borak looks you up and down.>This is going to be tricky, but I think I can make it work. I can disguise you as one of these Illidari blood elves, George. What I need first, though, are several pieces of their armor. It is imperative that the armor be clean. No blood stains! We want to avoid suspicion. Bring me the gear and I'll take care of the rest of the disguise. Once the disguise is assembled, you're going to deliver the message to the Grand Commander - in person. 
Deliver the Dragonfire Trap to Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	It's a Trap!	There's nothing more that I hate in this world than the sons of Gruul and their father! They slaughtered my people, and my children, and now I will have a taste of revenge! I have fashioned a trap from some dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you might just be able to use it to kill a gronn. I'm sure that you have a particular gronn in mind; it matters not to me which one you kill. Just hurry, take the trap to your Commander Stonewall. My thirst for revenge must be quenched! 
	Oshu'gun Crystal Powder	 
Report to Forward Commander Kingston at Expedition Point.	Expedition Point	Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, Mechanic. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Rohamus's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in...Head east about 400 paces, across the Valley of Bones, until you run into a destroyed fel reaver. You'll see Expedition Point where a Legion base used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Forward Commander Kingston. Now move out! 
Speak with Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at the Proving Grounds in Netherstorm.	Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.	On the outskirts of town to the east are the Proving Grounds. Our top experimentalist, Doctor Vomisa, has been toying with a combination of fel reaver, ethereal, and of course, goblin technologies there. This is in no small part thanks to your gathering efforts Junior Technician 3rd Grade, George! Go to him; I know that he'll have a solution for saving Area 52. And since he's likely to use you as a test subject, if I were you, I'd bring some friends along just in case. 
Fahssn at the Spawning Glen wants you to collect 10 Mature Spore Sacs.	The Sporelings' Plight	You there! You must help us! The fungal giants are devouring all of our spore sacs! You must do something, or we'll lose our young! The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted. Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can! 
Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Plants of Zangarmarsh	The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water. We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct. As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them. If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts. They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them. 
	More Marks of Kil'jaeden	 
Mirren Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 8 Kaliri Feathers from the various kaliri found in the Den of Haal'esh.	The Finest Down	The arakkoa at the Den of Haal'esh, south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called kaliri. Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in Azeroth. Just think of all the ale I could buy then! Tell you what, you bring me a stack of kaliri feathers and I'll give you my very own hat. What do you say? You'll never find a hat like this one! Do we have a deal? 
Tor'chunk Twoclaws has tasked you with the destruction of any 30 Bladespire Ogres and 10 Bladespire Raptors at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. Return to him at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains once your task is completed.	The Bladespire Threat	There is a threat to Thunderlord Stronghold worse than the Alliance at Sylvanaar. I speak of the ogres of these mountains. Just to the west, down in the ravine, lies the Bladespire clan. While they aren't the only ogres, they are the closest and they're the ones that we defeated to take this place. Head north through the Jagged Ridge, and then down the path, which leads to their hold. Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres and their raptors as you can at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. 
Collect Time-Lost Scrolls from the time-lost arakkoa in Skettis and bring them to a Skull Pile inside a summoning circle in Skettis. Summon and defeat the descendants of Terokk's adversaries and return to Hakkiz with Akkarai's Talon, Garokk's Spine, Vekkaz's Scale and Gezzarak's Claw.	Tokens of the Descendants	The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book. Gezzarak the Huntress, Garokk the Crystal Giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vekkaz the Windrager. They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa and burn them at the summoning circles all over Skettis. Bring me a token from each one. These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends. 
Farseer Kurkush at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to bring him 20 Murkblood Idols.	Vile Idolatry	With our leadership in ruin, we are left open to attacks from all sides. The foul Murkblood tribe could not have picked a better time to attack us! In recent days, we have been subject to no less than 5 assaults from the Broken. They have even taken over our only other territorial holding in the area: Sunspring Post. We must strike and show them that we are not powerless! Strike down the vile idolaters and bring me their twisted idols of worship so that they may ride the lightning. 
Travel to the entrance to the Black Temple in Shadowmoon Valley and speak to Xi'ri.	Entry Into the Black Temple	<A'dal shows you an image of a naaru outside of the Black Temple, fighting alongside draenei vindicators and blood elf magisters. You immediately understand that this is the distraction Akama is waiting for.> 
Prospector Conall at Telredor wants you to kill Sporewing.	Unfinished Business	The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them. What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor. 
Elementalist Morgh at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to slay 8 Murkblood Putrifiers.	Murkblood Corrupters	Murkblood are capturing and torturing the spirits of air! Murkblood are my kin: A tribe of the Broken who serve the vile Musel'ek, beast lord of Coilfang. The air spirit states that the Murkblood putrifiers are capturing other spirits of air and using them to sow chaos into the ranks of the elements. It would seem that the Murkblood have recently sacked an orc village to the southwest known as Sunspring and are using powerful elemental magic to disturb the lake. Find the putrifiers and destroy them. 
Using a Flaming Torch, destroy 4 Sunfury Ballistas and 4 Sunfury Tents and return to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village.	Torching Sunfury Hold	Ridding Sunfury Hold of its garrison is not sufficient to keep the blood elves from reoccupying it. Kael'thas's followers are zealous and tenacious. Leaving them anything to use at Sunfury is effectively an invitation to return. No, it must all be destroyed. See to it that their tents and artillery burn to ashes!<The ghost's fists clench.>Steal torches from the Sunfury flamekeepers to accomplish your task, George. 
Bring 8 Draenei Vessels to Ros'eleth at the Allerian Stronghold.	Vessels of Power	Amid the ruins of Tuurem are a number of vessels containing raw, magical energy. We are fortunate that the Broken who have overrun the city are ignorant to the resource in their midst, but we cannot assume they will remain so forever. With those vessels and their power in hand, the scattered survivors of my people can resist the lure of demonic magic. Every quel'dorei we can save from our prince's folly is one more that can help us regain our lost glory. Bring me these vessels, Mechanic. 
Commander Skyshadow has tasked you with the destruction of any 30 Bloodmaul Ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost. Return to him at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains once your gruesome task is completed.	The Bloodmaul Ogres	There is a threat to Sylvanaar far deadlier than the Horde at Thunderlord Stronghold. I'm speaking of the native ogres of these mountains. Just to the south and east, down in the ravine, lives the Bloodmaul clan. While they aren't the only group of ogres that threaten us here, they are the closest. I would have you head south through the Living Grove, and then go down the path to the east, which leads to their outpost. Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost as you can. 
Return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in Blade's Edge Mountains.	Reunion	So you come from the world beyond the Portal? And you know of Rexxar. Oh yes, I am quite familiar with him. You see, he is my son. But he made his choice a lifetime ago. He is not one of us, and he is not welcome here. We have enough troubles with the Bloodmaul ogres. Know this: being born a half-breed does not make you Mok'Nathal. 
Deliver Gorgrom's Favor to Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Favor of the Gronn	A token in the form of a small statuette falls from Dorgok's dead clutch. It bears a striking resemblance to one of the gronn. Surely, Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Ruuan Weald, up the ramp to the east, would be interested in this! 
Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.	What Strange Creatures...	I am interested in learning more about the strange reptiles that mill about the lava flows of Shadowmoon Valley. Never have I seen beasts able to withstand the searing heat of molten lava! Outside of Shadowmoon Village, where the ground has ruptured and lava flows through the cracks, you will find felfire diemetradons. Slay them and bring me their spleens. From their spleens I will be able to begin preliminary analysis of their resistance to heat. Begin your search to the southeast. 
	Purging the Chambers of Bash'ir	 
Obtain 10 Oshu'gun Crystal Fragments and bring them to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.	Stealing from Thieves	Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru. Sort of puts a damper on our operation. I think I might've found a loophole, however. You see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond. A thief called Gava'xi has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it. Your job, Human, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours. 
If you are looking to fight the Burning Legion, find Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand.	He Called Himself Altruis...	A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand. He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons? Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him. 
Ronag the Slave Driver in the Netherwing Mines of Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay the Crazed Murkblood Foreman and 5 Crazed Murkblood Miners.	Crazed and Confused	Don't worry about this dragon, George. We've got plans for it...Deeper in this mine is a band of crazed Murkblood. After the dragon broke out, they were cut off from the exit. Somehow, after a mere 2 days of isolation, they've lost all sense of decency. They've resorted to cannibalism and the promotion of mayhem. We don't need that kind of madness in this place. Find 'em and kill 'em. All of 'em. 
Assist Commander Arcus and the Aldor in defending the Altar of Sha'tar. Once all of the Dragonmaw forces have been defeated, return to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp with the Aldor Medals.	The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid	Take these Aldor medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of ""victory"" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Aldor soldiers. Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word. 
Bring Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to Voren'thal the Seer at the Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	Bound for Glory	Now I can properly send you back to Shattrath City. You've uncovered evidence of Kael'thas making pacts with the Burning Legion and you've got the key to the overlord's back door. Make sure Voren'thal doesn't topple over with excitement from the news - the old man's getting a bit fragile, if you know what I mean. You'll find him inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier. 
Use the Felhound Whistle to summon a Fel Guard Hound. Take the Fel Guard Hound for a walk and kill some Deranged Helboars. Search for the Shredder Keys in the Fel Guard Hound's ""leavings."" Return the Shredder Keys to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.	Shizz Work	I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys. I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp. They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot. They also like shiny things. I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys. I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk. Kill some helboars and let him eat. He'll do his business. When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his ""leavings."" 
Listen to Altruis's story.	Illidan's Pupil	You've proven your allegiance, George. You must forgive my caution, but in this world things are not what they appear. I will tell you about Varedis when you're ready. 
Gor'drek has asked you to slay 12 Bladewing Bloodletters. Return to him at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have accomplished that.	The Encroaching Wilderness	The Thunderlord were once a proud orc clan before they were transformed into fel orcs through the blood of Mannoroth. Recently we recovered this orc stronghold from the ogres that infest the ravine below. They had moved in when the Thunderlord clan abandoned it. We will keep this place and I will have your help doing so. In the Jagged Ridge to the south and the west, there are bloodletters that have become like a plague upon us. They eat and breed incessantly. Kill them and then return to me. 
Sergeant Altumus at the East Supply Caravan east of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller.	The Path of Anguish	Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground. They have stationed dreadlords at the Path of Anguish, east of here. They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion. 
Hunt down 30 Ravenous Windrocs and then return to Fitz at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.	Windroc Mastery	You must always push yourself if you are to one day stalk the mightiest of prey! While you are not yet ready, I will point you in the right direction. There is another breed of windroc even deadlier. Seek out the ravenous windroc to test your mettle against. You will find them in the heart of Nagrand to the west and southwest. 
Speak with Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp.	Enter the Taskmaster	<Mor'ghor crumples up the service letter and tosses it aside.>Alright grunt, first things first. If you're gonna join my beloved Dragonmaw army, you'll need to work. Everyone works up here on the ledge. Get a job and don't screw it up and I'll see if there might be something more interesting for you to do later. Go talk to Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath. He's standin' in the middle of town. He'll assess your skills and assign work as he sees fit. Now get out of my face! 
Take the Murkblood Escape Plans to the Mistress of the Mines.	The Great Murkblood Revolt	This document outlines a revolt planned by the Murkblood broken. It seems that the dragon was to be used as a diversion to draw attention away from their escape. Looking at all of the corpses littering the mine, it would be safe to assume that their plans failed. Return the escape plans to the Mistress of the Mines. 
Take the Explosives Package to Sky Sergeant Doryn at Blackwind Landing outside Skettis.	To Skettis!	The Barrier Hills are only one of the fronts where we've been deployed. A less immediate but far more dangerous threat looms from beyond the Skethyl Mountains, from within the arakkoa city of Skettis. A few months ago our scouts detected a huge increase in arakkoa activity there. Several attacks against Shattrath followed. We've stationed forces outside of their city since. Take these explosives to Sergeant Doryn at Blackwind Landing, just outside Skettis. Tell him you're a new recruit. 
Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to listen to his story. Speak to Oronok to begin hearing his story.	The Cipher of Damnation - Truth and History	<Oronok adjusts his posture and stands to his full height.>I had to be sure, George. And to be sure, I had to test you. Please excuse the little masquerade. I am as much a farmer as you are <female/male>. Which is to say, not at all. If you are to recover the Cipher of Damnation, you will need to listen to what I have to tell you. When you are ready, let me know and I will tell you the story. 
Mosswood the Ancient wants you to journey to Skald and plant Ironroot Seeds in three different mounds of Fertile Volcanic Soil and then return to him in Ruuan Weald.	From the Ashes	If you follow the road east and up the side of the mountain, then turn north, you will come to my long lost home. Once there was a wood there. Its name is forgotten. Long ago the Burning Legion summoned scorched imps and other creatures of flame. My home was destroyed and my people fled. Now only I remain. I have saved some ironroot seeds that could be planted in fertile volcanic soil. Their magic is strong. Do this for me and I will share with you the treasures of a forgotten age. 
Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Harbingers.	Harbingers of Shadowmoon	Let it be known that Zorus does have a sense of humor. Enough small talk. Don the Spectrecles so that you are able to see the Shadowmoon orc spirits that wander this stronghold. Do not be frightened as we are truly the invaders here. Alas, they must be destroyed, for their time has long since passed. Destroy the Shadowmoon harbingers infesting Wildhammer Stronghold and return to me. 
Obtain the Heliotrope Oculus from Spellreaver Marathelle at Sunfury Hold. Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to contact the archmage once you have achieved your goal. If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.	Unlocking the Compendium	While I'm glad to have most of Krasus's Compendium back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, Krasus was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes. Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets. During Kael'thas's attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble. 
Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar wants you to obtain 10 Obsidian Warbeads from the various ogres that inhabit Nagrand.	Fierce Enemies	If you seek to prove your loyalty to us, there is no better way than to fight against our enemies. Of these, there are none that can match the ogres in strength and fierceness. Bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks as proof of their demise and I'll let the others know of your prowess. 
Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.	Now That We're Still Friends...	Reports have come in that the naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast continue to kill our people. We thought that you had dealt with this, Mechanic! I suggest that you to teach them a lesson as proof of our continued friendship. 
Locate and speak with Private Weeks near the north entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.	Speak with Private Weeks	A report's just come in from one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village. He says that a shadowy band has moved into the ruins there. George, I want you to speak with Private Weeks and see how you can assist him to figure out what this unknown group is up to. Just head west past Stonebreaker Hold. His last report puts his position near the north entrance to the village. 
Toshley would like you to use the Light Trap to catch 15 Razaani Light Orbs. Return to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so.	Trapping the Light Fantastic	The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north. I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs? They're probably only for decoration anyway. The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it. Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence. 
To begin your understanding of the Mok'Nathal, slay Vekh, leader of the Vekh'nir arakkoa. Then, return to Leoroxx at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Understanding the Mok'Nathal	<Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul.>You come to the Mok'Nathal, but you do not understand us. You do not understand our struggle to survive. If you would understand us, then you will have to endure a taste of that struggle. To the south are the Vekh'nir arakkoa. They have enslaved a group of ogres in the caverns known as Trogma's Claim and their leader, Vekh is in there. Slay him! 
Go to Manaforge Ara and speak to Magister Theledorn. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	A Defector	We've recently been contacted by a Sunfury magister who wishes to join our ranks and swears he has information we're in need of. We've checked our informants to make sure he's not a double agent and he checks out. He's stationed in Manaforge Ara which makes communication difficult. Talk to him and see what he knows. If he's half as useful as he claims to be, we'll be able to put him to good use. 
Altruis the Sufferer wants you to slay Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.	Against the Illidari	I still have respect for Illidan. Without him I would not have found my path. He is not who he once was, however. His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat. He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion. His grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast. Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley. 
Haalrun at Telredor wants you to bring him 8 Diaphanous Wings from any of the firefly species in Zangarmarsh.	Diaphanous Wings	Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first. I've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible.<Haalrun chuckles.>I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings? 
Bring the Eye of Reskk and the Eye of Shienor to Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City district of Shattrath.	The Eyes of Skettis	Doom harkens from the cliffs of Skettis. My people, the arakkoa, face a fate shrouded in unspeakable evil. Too often have we abused dark magic for wrongdoing. Through A'dal I have learned of the Light and of redemption. Terokk watches his colonies from Skettis through orbs enchanted by the black art. Steal these Eyes from Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor in northern Terokkar. Let me see what Terokk sees. Let me look through the eyes of Skettis. 
Speak with the Ogre, Grok, in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.	Speak with the Ogre	<V'eru's voice fills your mind with crystalline tone and clarity.>There is an ogre down in the Lower City, pleading for the assistance of passersby. They have all turned a deaf ear upon his plight. Do you think you might aid him? His name is Grok, and he is sitting near the merchants to the southeast. Thank you, George. 
Use the Unstable Warp Rift Generator in the Warp Fields. Gather 3 Warp Nethers from Unstable Voidwalkers and return them to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.	The Warp Rifts	Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void. Now I am old and weak. Perhaps you will help me? I must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers. You must find the Warp Fields to the west. West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak. Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift. You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through. 
Lieutenant Fairweather has tasked you with slaying 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks. Afterward, return to her at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Crush the Bloodmaul Camp!	I've heard that you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres thus far. Now, I would ask that you face them again. I want you to crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp! To get down there, head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald. You'll find them at the base of the ramp. Good luck, Mechanic! 
	More Obsidian Warbeads	 
T'chali has asked you to take the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg and use it in an attempt to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk. If successful, return to T'chali the Witch Doctor at Bloodmaul Ravine in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Bladespire Kegger	As T'chali was saying, he helped out his Bloodmaul friends to make their brew. But what T'chali did not say was why. The Bloodmaul are in dire straits. The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight. That's when T'chali came up with a great idea. Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy? Only thing is, T'chali does not know if it works. So, you gonna take this brew up to Bladespire Hold and see if it works! 
Collect and use a Vekh'nir Crystal at the Vekh'nir Spell Circle, then return the Charged Vekh'nir Crystal to Dertrok at the Mok'Nathal Village.	The Stones of Vekh'nir	The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose. I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their spell circles to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me. 
Report to Commander Hogarth in the Expedition Armory.	Honor the Fallen	Hogarth, the commander of the Armory, is in the eastern tower. You must report your victory over Urtrak to him. Perhaps he will be friendly? Of course he may try to consume your soul. One can never tell with spirits such as these. The Unyielding are still against us and will no doubt kill you if they can. Be careful George. 
Kill Worg Master Kruush and bring his head to Captain Darkhowl in Spinebreaker Post.	WANTED: Worg Master Kruush	The poster reads:""Worg Master Kruush leads the worg riders of the Bleeding Hollow clan. A price has been placed on his head, for his riders exact heavy tolls on supply trains to Spinebreaker Post.""""Scouts report him within Zeth'Gor, and the hero able to bring the severed head of this villain to me will earn the thanks of the Horde, and a large bounty.""""-Captain Darkhowl"" 
Spiritcaller Dohgar has asked you to use the Spirit Calling Totems to collect 8 Lesser Nether Drake Spirits and return them to him at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Spirit Calling	The spirits of the nether drakes in the Singing Ridge are in need of liberation. The nether drakes were not always nether drakes. They used to be black drakes. But then, with the destruction of this world, a wave of nether energy washed over everything and had the side-effect of changing the drakeling eggs. Now they are all twisted versions of their former selves. We must help them to find peace. Do this by slaying a drake near to the spirit calling totem, and then take its spirit from it. 
Speak with Exarch Onaala at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Return to the Aldor	This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold... No! It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of. Return to those who sent you here, George. You now have the means to stop Varedis. Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence. That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power. 
Kill 30 Talbuk Stags and then return to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.	Talbuk Mastery	I don't think that I'm up to the hunt today. Do you think that you might take my place? I told Hemet that I was going to see about bagging us some of those talbuk that seem to be all over the place. The stags are especially nice to hunt. You can find them congregated around the nearby trees. Think that you could take care of that for me? 
	More Warbeads	 
Vindicator Idaar at Telredor wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants.	An Unnatural Drought	The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, George. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly. I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path. These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering. 
Vindicator Haylen wants you to return to Sha'tari Base Camp and speak with Scout Navrin.	Return to Sha'tari Base Camp	We will not make it back on our own. The dreadfang poison is too strong. You must return to Sha'tari Base Camp for us. Scout Navrin will send a rescue party out to find us. 
Slay Arix'Amal to get the Burning Legion Gate Key. Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the Rune of Spite, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.	Doorway to the Abyss	You are an honor to us, George. But now we must strike before the Legion recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies Invasion Point: Annihilator. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements. You must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the warchief's blessings be with you. 
Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate and bring them to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.	Setting Up the Bomb	We cannot permit the Legion to carry out its plan to destroy Wildhammer Stronghold on their march to the Black Temple. There's only one way to stop them, George. You must create an explosive large enough to destroy the Legion's entire stockpile of infernals at the hold. The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the base of your device. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for armor plating we might be able to make a casing from. 
Kill 4 Doomforge Attendants and 4 Doomforge Engineers.	Deceive thy Enemy	For every moment I hear silence, you draw closer to your death! SPEAK! What? The camp has revolted? This cannot possibly be true! My minions would not dare undermine my authority. Well then, every last one of them will pay for this treachery, they will pay dearly. Silence them all and be done with it! Report back to me once you have carried out my order or you shall be dealt with. 
Retrieve Skulloc's Soul and deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Into the Soulgrinder	The grimoire is the key to Skulloc's downfall. Read aloud from the book at Soulgrinder's Barrow to initiate the ritual. An object known as the Soulgrinder will appear, as well as Skulloc's ghostly victims, who will try to destroy it. You must keep them from doing so long enough to force Skulloc fully into the world. Find the barrow by heading north through the Daggermaw Canyon on the other side of the Circle of Blood. It is on the right side before Gruul's Lair. Bring back Skulloc's soul. 
Elder Ungriz at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you free 15 Mag'har Prisoners.	Finding the Survivors	If I know anything about ogres, it's that they like their food fresh. This means that the Mag'har that they captured are more than likely being kept alive until they are ready to serve. It's a sickening thought, I know, but one that we must use to our advantage. Venture to Warmaul Hill and search for Mag'har prisoners. If you find prisoners, then you will find keys to their cages on the nearby Warmaul ogres. Kill ogres for their keys and release the prisoners. 
Greatmother Geyah at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you collect 1 Olemba Root, 1 Marshberry, 1 Telaari Frond and 1 Dragonspine.	Material Components	Mother Kashur wishes to speak with you, George. Before this becomes possible, you must collect the herbs required to create a potion that will expand your mind, allowing you to commune with the spirits. You must gather Olemba root from Terokkar, marshberries from Zangarmarsh, Telaari fronds from Nagrand and dragonspine from the Blade's Edge mountains. I have written down instructions on this parchment as to the cultivation of these herbs. Return to me when you have gathered the materials. 
Custodian Dieworth in Kirin'Var Village wants you to confront and defeat Naberius in the village's Chapel Yard.	Destroy Naberius!	Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor. You must defeat him, George, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var. With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes? 
Altruis the Sufferer wants you to take the Imbued Silver Spear and use it at Portal Clearing near Marshlight Lake in Zangarmarsh to awake Xeleth. Return to Altruis after you've slain the demon.	Against All Odds	Some demons pledge allegiance to no one but themselves. A true enemy of demons finds and destroys his prey regardless of affiliation, however. The demon Xeleth - a Legion defector - was once worshipped as a god by primitive swamp creatures in Zangarmarsh. When Draenor was nearly destroyed, he retreated into a slumber deep beneath Marshlight Lake. Find the portal at the lake and plant this spear into the ground. Xeleth will awake - be ready to slay him and prove you're an enemy to all demons. 
Harbinger Haronem in Shattrath City wants you to use the Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles to take 6 Multiphase Readings.	The Multiphase Survey	I'm sure that 'gnomish inventor' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand. According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings? 
Kill Naphthal'ar and then return to Warden Treelos at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	It's Watching You!	Quick, hide! The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you... upon us all! I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say. Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily. If you can, convince it to come down for tea. But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me! 
Bring 8 Diaphanous Wings from any species of Zangarmarsh fireflies to Magasha in Swamprat Post.	There's No Explanation for Fashion	<Magasha chuckles softly to herself.>I bet if they knew they were wearing bug parts, the fashion trend would end very quickly. We first started killing the bugs 'round here 'cause they were getting in the way of our construction. Some enterprising merchant stops here, spends the night, and next thing you know he's buyin' up all the bug wings we have! Says he makes clothes out of 'em. I be stickin' to my armor, thanks. But if you gather the wings of any of the fireflies, I'll gladly buy 'em. 
Gather 8 Bonestripper Tail Feathers from Bonestripper Vultures and bring them to Falconer Drenna Riverwind at Falcon Watch.	Trueflight Arrows	With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of Alliance forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the rangers, but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time. I could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch. 
Go to Sporeggar, north of the Spawning Glen, and deliver the Salvaged Spore Sacs to Msshi'fn.	Sporeggar	You're a kind Human, George. Not like some of the others I've met. You should meet the rest of my people; they'll be very grateful for your help. Take these spore sacs to my leader, Msshi'fn. You will find him in Sporeggar, north of here. 
Use Gor'drek's Ointment on 5 of the Thunderlord Dire Wolves to strengthen them and the defense of the Jagged Ridge. Then return to Gor'drek at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Protecting Our Own	With the magical dust you recovered, I have fashioned a magic ointment that will aid in our own defenses. Our dire wolves are the perfect combination of mount, sentry and friend, but the Alliance scum have been poaching them in the Jagged Ridge. George, I want you to take this ointment and apply it to our dire wolf friends. The Alliance will get a rude surprise the next time that they send one of their hunting parties. Be aware though that some of the wolves may not like this, and will turn on you. 
Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 15 Ever-burning Ash samples.	A Ghost in the Machine	I fear that these dwarves do not understand what they have built upon. This area was once the ancestral grounds for the Shadowmoon orcs. I speak of spirits, Human. For nearly twenty years they have laid dormant beneath the Wildhammer Stronghold, but recently, something has riled them up. Venture beyond the gates of Wildhammer and seek out the pools and rivers of fel lava found across this land. Near the lava will be ever-burning ash. Bring me this ash so that I may craft something that will help us. 
Retrieve the Sigil of Krasus from Spellbinder Maryana at Manaforge Coruu, northwest of the Violet Tower. When you have gained the sigil, use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to project an Image of Archmage Vargoth and inform him of your progress. If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.	The Sigil of Krasus	Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me. However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily. 
Investigate the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh, and then report back to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh with your findings.	Observing the Sporelings	We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them. One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions. I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west. Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw. 
The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover 1 Prepared Ethereum Wrapping.	S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E	We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit. I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device. 
Thiah Redmane, at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula, has asked you to gather 6 Helboar Blood Samples from Hulking Helboars.	Demonic Contamination	Welcome to the Cenarion Post, Mechanic. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places. The Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome. 
Find Grek and ask him to try it on his weapon. Once he's tried out the oil, return to Rakoria with the results.	And Now, the Moment of Truth	The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil. The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the orc knows his way around a weapon! Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it. 
Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Nazgrel in Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.	A Strange Weapon	You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely. There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon. Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before. Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon. 
Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Vekax in Shattrath's Lower City.	The Outcast's Plight	As an outcast, I am marked by death by arakkoa loyal to the city of Skettis. I cannot leave these walls for fear of my life, but that doesn't mean I cannot strike at them in retaliation. I have a small cache of treasure that I'm willing to part with, should you help me strike back at my would-be assassins. Bring me feathers from the denizens of the various Veils of Terokkar as proof of their demise. 
Obtain Hazzik's Package at his dwelling in eastern Skettis and return to him with it.	Hazzik's Bargain	Do not draw attention to our conversation. Adaris would not approve. I belong to the lowest caste of arakkoa, George. During Terokk's rule I would've been sacrificed to the dark powers worshipped by his talonpriests. If what you say is true and the talonpriests are seeking Terokk's return, then you must prevent them from succeeding - regardless of what your leader says! I've something to offer you that you'll find useful. There is a package at my old dwelling in Upper Veil Shil'ak. Bring it to me! 
Escort the Skyguard Prisoner to safety and report to Sky Sergeant Doryn.	Escape from Skettis	Hail, George. I thank you for coming to my aid. The arakkoa's monstrous birds knocked me from my nether ray while on a scouting mission. Let's get out of here, while we can. 
Speak with Assistant Klatu, at Honor Hold's inn.	Return to Honor Hold	George, while you were on your mission in Zeth'Gor, I received news of my commanding officer, Colonel Jules. He was stricken with a demonic corruption while fighting near the Gor'gaz Outpost, and his situation has grown very bad. You have made such great gains for us against the fel orcs. Your strength in battle is without question... is your spirit just as strong? Please, return to Honor Hold and speak with Klatu, in an upper room at the Honor Hold inn. 
Eliminate Draaca Longtail, the leader of the wyrmcultists in Wyrmskull Tunnel. Report back to Watcher Moonshade at the Wyrmskull Tunnel in the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.	Longtail is the Lynchpin	With the Blackwing wyrmcultists massing in the tunnel, we're hard pressed to deal with the situation. Quite frankly, they have the numbers. And while we've been able to take care of any of their people that get too close, the fact remains that if they attack in earnest, we're going to be overrun. The situation calls for someone to get through to the other end of the tunnel, and take out their leader, Draaca Longtail. Up for some fun? 
Find the Boulderfist Key and Free Corki. Speak with Arechron in Telaar should you succeed.	HELP!	HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it! Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres. If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron. 
Greatmother Geyah at Garadar has asked that you speak with Garrosh.	The Inconsolable Chieftain	You have done so much for the Mag'har, George. Your accomplishments are known to all, including Garrosh. Go to him now and tell him of your latest victory. Tell him that you do what you do for him and his people. Surely he will be lifted by your words. 
Ikeyen at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to travel to Umbrafen Village and slay Kataru, 8 Umbrafen Seers, 6 Umbrafen Witchdoctors and 6 Umbrafen Oracles.	The Umbrafen Tribe	The naga are terrible, yes. But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them! The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day. Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru. Until then I will fear for my life every single day. 
You have been asked to deliver Alicia's Poem to Caylee Dak in Shattrath City in Outland.	Alicia's Poem	Hi, I wrote a poem for my friend Caylee. She likes to hang out with the Aldor in Shattrath City. You know, in Outland? Could you take my poem to her? My mommy says I'm too young to go to Shattrath City! 
Kill 8 Thornfang Ravagers and 8 Thornfang Venomspitters, and then return to Mahuram Stouthoof at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Keep Thornfang Hill Clear!	We've been fighting an ongoing battle to keep the pass through Thornfang Hill to the west clear of ravagers. It would be bad if we were to become completely cut off from the refuge in Zangarmarsh. We don't want to displace the creatures, but there seems to be little choice as their attacks on travelers through the area have become more aggressive. Clear some of the ravagers out of there if you can. 
Magister Bloodhawk wants you to kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar.	The Agony and the Darkness	Greetings, George. I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers. 
Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy 12 Lake Spirits.	Agitated Spirits of Skysong	The disturbance in the ebb and flow of the waters of Nagrand has greatly agitated the water spirits of Skysong Lake. They have in turn begun sowing destruction throughout the waterways of the area. Watoosun of the Water has come to us in a vision and granted us permission to remedy the problem - so long as the source of the disturbance is also dealt with...We will get to the source, but first you must deal with the problems immediate to the Throne. Destroy the agitated lake spirits and return to me. 
Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill Felspine the Greater and recover Felspine's Hide.	Felspine the Greater	Gnomus knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his arcano-scorp. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit. Get back to the lava flow near Baa'ri and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide. Don't try and reason with me, George. I'm well past that point. 
Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to drive 20 Warmaul Ogre Banners through the bodies of Kil'sorrow members at Kil'sorrow Fortress. Return any unused Warmaul Ogre Banners.	Ruthless Cunning	<Lantresor hands you a pack full of banners.>These are Warmaul ogre banners that I recently acquired. I want you to travel to Kil'sorrow Fortress, directly south of here, and kill as many of the Kil'sorrow filth as you can find. Drive a Warmaul ogre banner through the heart of each fallen Kil'sorrow soldier. Return to me when you have completed this task and the other that this plan requires. 
Exarch Orelis in Area 52 wants you to take the Warp-Attuned Orb to Manaforge B'naar and use it at the end of its four pipelines. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Measuring Warp Energies	If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger. Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land. The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines. Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies. Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth. 
Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Shadowstalker Kaide.	An Unwelcome Presence	Our forces at Thrallmar thought they had the fel orcs contained in the Hellfire Citadel area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise. We can't permit them to gain a foothold here. Rokag has dispatched Shadowstalker Kaide to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in. Go to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there. 
Collect 10 Restless Bones. Deliver them to Ramdor the Mad, just off the western side of the Ring of Observance in Auchindoun, which is in the middle of the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest.	Recover the Bones	The bones of the dead draenei litter the Bone Wastes from the explosion of Auchindoun. Their spirits are restless, and cannot move on to the next life. Mechanic, you must help me to recover their bones and take them to their final resting place! Only then will they be at peace; only then will they know comfort. Gather up the restless bones with care and deliver them to Ramdor the Mad at Auchindoun in the center of the Bone Wastes. Despite his name, he will know how to care for them. 
Take the Feralfen Totem to the foot of the stairs at the Boha'mu Ruins and plant it in the ground. Report your findings to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin.	A Spirit Ally?	We must find out how much power this Feralfen snake spirit possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an Outland spirit at my command! Take this totem with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested. 
Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan wants you to extinguish the four signal fires of Veil Shalas.	Veil Shalas: Signal Fires	Terokk's perch, Skettis, looms above the Bone Wastes to the east. At the base of Skettis lies Veil Shalas, the most formidable of Terokk's colonies. It is through the stronghold of Veil Shalas that Terokk's forward sages wage war against the Light. The evil-doers of Shalas communicate with their master using a complex system of magical signal fires. Travel to the east, Human, and extinguish the fires. Once Veil Shalas is silenced, we can begin to plot the fall of Skettis. But I get ahead of myself. 
Return to Sky Commander Adaris with the news about Terokk's return.	Countdown to Doom	This almanac presages the return of Terokk, the most powerful and terrible Skettis king in arakkoa history. I always believed this to be the mere legend, George. The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise. With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength. Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely. Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this. Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing. 
Force Commander Danath Trollbane has ordered you to kill Drillmaster Zurok with all due haste. Return to the force commander at Honor Hold in the Hellfire Peninsula once the drillmaster is dead.	Drill the Drillmaster	I'm receiving reports that the Shattered Hand fel orcs, out in front of Hellfire Citadel, are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault. No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the clans. Get to the base of the citadel, where the Path of Glory ends. You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down. Eliminate the one that's in charge of that force. Kill Drillmaster Zurok! 
Reclaim Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 1, Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 2, and Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 3 from Kirin'Var Village's Town Square. Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to contact the archmage once you have the chapters. If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.	Krasus's Compendium	The Kirin Tor sent one other of Krasus's possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war. Before Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town. 
Use the Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to beam the Hyper Rotational Dig-A-Matic, Servo-Pneumatic Dredging Claw, Multi-Spectrum Terrain Analyzer, and the Big Wagon Full of Explosives back to Area 52. Then report to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle at the eastern end of the fissure that runs through Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Invaluable Asset Zapping	See the fissure running through Area 52? We did that! <grin>It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment. We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in. I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins. Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure. Junior Technician 3rd Grade George, this is your chance for that promotion. Don't blow it! 
Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 40 Netherdust Pollen.	Netherdust Pollen	A flower picker?! Hilarious... Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete. 
Follow Murg ""Oldie"" Muckjaw while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Murg ""Oldie"" Muckjaw, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: The Ballad of Oldie McOld	Don't let the gray hair fool you, grunt. I'm still ten times the rider that you are! And don't go thinking that this old dog doesn't have any tricks up his sleeve. Now all you gotta do is follow me and try not to get knocked down off your mount. If you can do that, Oldie will admit defeat. We'll lift off as soon as you're ready. 
Slay 8 Sunfury Conjurers, 6 Sunfury Bowmen and 4 Sunfury Centurions. Return to Magistrix Larynna at Area 52 after completing this task. Completing tasks for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	Kick Them While They're Down	The news you've discovered is fortunate, George. Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army. Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into. I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up. 
Report back to Exarch Orelis at Area 52. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Aldor No More	My mission here is finished. I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to. No more. I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of this alliance between Kael'thas and the Burning Legion. First they give our holiest city away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies. Go back to Orelis; tell him the naaru can fight their own fights from now on. 
Bring 6 Marshlight Bleeder Venom to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.	Stinger Venom	When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something. We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land. My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing. 
	Arcane Tomes	 
Bring Ishaal's Almanac to Sky Commander Adaris north of Skettis.	Ishaal's Almanac	This mysterious tome was on Talonpriest Ishaal's body. It contains arcane symbols and charts of celestial bodies beyond your comprehension. All writing is in a language you don't understand; likely an ancient version of the arakkoa written tongue. Perhaps you should bring this to Sky Commander Adaris. 
Use the Nether Ray Cage in the woods south of Blackwind Landing and slay Blackwind Warp Chasers near the Hungry Nether Ray. Return to Skyguard Handler Deesak when you've completed your task.	Hungry Nether Rays	Nether rays are surprisingly loyal and obedient once properly trained. Unfortunately the war on Skettis is taking a toll on them. We have dozens of sorties a day - the poor fellows rarely get a break. And with recent shortages on feed, if those blasted birdmen don't kill them on a mission then starvation will. If you can lend a hand, take one of our rays to the woods in the south. They don't mind warp chaser meat as long as it's a fresh kill. 
Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar in Hellfire Peninsula and obtain 5 Demonic Essences from the Illidari Taskmasters. Return to Apothecary Azethen at Falcon Watch after you've completed the task.	Source of the Corruption	Uncorrupted draenei, like this unlucky fellow here, are virtuous champions of the Light. What corruption caused their great race to devolve into the Broken and Lost Ones? I've heard a theory that exposure to fel energies is what caused the mutation. I would like to put that theory to the test. Northwest of here lie the Ruins of Sha'naar. There you will find lowly Broken commanded by Illidari taskmasters. Bring me demonic essences from the taskmasters so that I can test them on this draenei. 
Vindicator Aluumen wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweavers. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Reclaiming Holy Grounds	You did well against the Broken in Baa'ri, George. Let's see how well you do against Illidan's most feared army. The fel orcs of the Shadowmoon Clan occupy the Ata'mal Terrace, once a very holy site where ata'mal crystals were used in spiritual ceremonies. We had reason to believe they were hiding an actual ata'mal crystal in the vicinity, but our scrying has revealed nothing. Nevertheless, the fel orcs are on draenei holy ground and their presence must be dealt with. 
Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to slay 15 Dragonmaw Orcs. Any Dragonmaw Orc in Dragonmaw Fortress will suffice.	Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress	I require time so that I may devise a plan to save my children and mate. You will buy me this time, mortal. Venture into Dragonmaw Fortress, located on the eastern edge of the Netherwing Fields, and lay waste to all Dragonmaw orcs that you find. The ensuing chaos and confusion should have a considerable impact on their plans. Be warned, some of my kin are too far gone - their minds corrupted by the Dragonmaw. For them, the only resolution is death. You have my permission to end their lives as well. 
Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard and bring them to Custodian Dieworth.	A Lingering Suspicion	The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture. As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts. How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations. 
	More Shadow Dust	 
Deliver the Crimson Crystal Shard to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Crimson Crystal Clue	As the colossus falls under the weight of your attacks, you notice for the first time that it was holding a red crystal fragment. While it was small and unnoticeable in the mountain giant's hand, it's a fairly hefty piece for you to carry around. It also suspiciously looks like it's a piece of the giant crystal in the middle of the ridge. It's most definitely a clue as to the strangeness that is occurring here, and you're sure that the druids at the Cenarion Post to the south will want to see it. 
Speak with Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Baron Sablemane	Here is my plan. We will poison the ogres and then destroy their gronn master. During my travels in these mountains, I met a man named Baron Sablemane. He is a master of the alchemical arts, and may be convinced to assist us. You will find him at the Circle of Blood, down in the canyon to the north of here. Whatever price he requires, I will leave it to your discretion to accept. 
	Fei Fei's Treat	 
Sentinel Moonwhisper at the tunnel between Zangarmarsh and Blade's Edge Mountains wants you to kill 6 Cavern Crawlers and report to Commander Skyshadow in Sylvanaar.	Killing the Crawlers	Commander Skyshadow wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with the Harborage. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Commander Skyshadow at once! 
Communicate with Gordawg.	The Underneath	Something rails the underneath. It beats the ground as if to punish.*Thud*<Untrag beats his chest with his fist.>It makes this sound a hundred-thousand times. Endlessly it beats. The earth reels. It is calling out to us now. Gordawg speaks to me. Gordawg knows that something forces the elements out. Something from the underneath. Go now and speak to Gordawg. No, listen to Gordawg, do not speak. Hear Gordawg... 
Kill 10 Marshfang Rippers and return to Noraani at Telredor.	Menacing Marshfangs	During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous. It seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone. 
Speak to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Hero's Call: Zangarmarsh!	The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost. Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh. Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there. 
	Assist Exarch Orelis	Not long ago, High Priestess Ishanah sent a small group of anchorites to Netherstorm, under the command of Exarch Orelis. They were to investigate the activities of Kael'thas and his minions, but we haven't received any reports of their findings yet. I worry that our presence in the area might not be strong enough to carry out the mission. I'm certain that the exarch could benefit from your knowledge and experience. Are you willing to travel to Area 52 and assist him? 
Rina Moonspring wants you to take her Diminution Powder and apply it to 5 of the Bloodmaul Dire Wolves, which can be found at Bloodmaul Outpost and in Bloodmaul Ravine. After doing so, return to her at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	A Dire Situation	With their wolf pack reduced, the Horde is looking for replacements. Unfortunately there's another source nearby. The Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries. I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time? I've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes. Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the Horde. 
Go to Void Ridge and kill the creatures you find. Collect 40 Void Ridge Soul Shards and return them to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.	Void Ridge	We have to improve my warp rift generator. You must take it to Void Ridge. Head east of here. You must avoid the foul fort of Zeth'Gor. To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains. Through this pass you will find Void Ridge, a terrible place on the edge of the abyss. You must kill the walkers that you find there, and bring me shards of their souls. With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a portal to the beyond that cannot be closed. 
	More Crystal Fragments	 
Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to the outskirts of Manaforge B'naar and retrieve the B'naar Personnel Roster from Captain Arathyn. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Manaforge B'naar	You may have noticed one of Kael's manaforges on your way here. You know, the large purple buildings sucking energy from the sky? We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate them. You can help our information gathering efforts by obtaining a personnel roster. Giving us an idea of who's there and what they do will prove to be invaluable information. We believe Captain Arathyn, leading a ballista team just outside of Manaforge B'naar, is in possession of one such roster. Obtain it for us. 
Bring 10 Feralfen Protection Totems to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin.	Spirits of the Feralfen	The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored. Find the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, George, and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings. 
Magasha at Swamprat Post wants you to kill Sporewing.	A Job Undone	Someone needs to find a way to make Reavij come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work. Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the Dead Mire and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime. 
Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to burn 8 Slain Auchenai Warriors and 8 Slain Sha'tar Vindicators.	An Improper Burial	Is there nothing that can be done to stem the tide of corruption? My soldiers have been battling the Auchenai for days now with no end in sight. Each casualty, whether Auchenai or Sha'tar, is snatched from the battlefield - their souls lifted and taken to parts unknown. I will not have it! A proper burial is out of the question but those fiends will not have their souls! Take this torch and travel to the field of battle, directly east of here. Burn every corpse you see! We will not fuel their rituals. 
Speak with Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village.	Chief Apothecary Hildagard	The history of Shadowmoon Valley is a long and troubled one. Few study it for fear of breathing new life into the unspeakable atrocities that took place there. Not all are so timid, though. Chief Apothecary Hildagard's research delves into the ghosts of Shadowmoon's past. It is a staggering undertaking, one with which she would welcome help, I'm sure. If your travels bring you there, seek Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village, in the northwestern reaches of the valley. 
Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to destroy 10 Ravenous Flayer Eggs on the Shattered Plains.	A Lesson Learned	We need to show those flayers what happens when you mess with Oronok's business! I want you to go back to the Shattered Plains and destroy every flayer egg that you see. They'll be deep in flayer territory so keep your guard up. 
Chu'a'lor suggested that you speak with Jho'nass at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.	A Special Thank You	You honor us with your efforts on our behalf. And now there is someone that we would like for you to meet. Jho'nass is our most trusted quartermaster. He maintains a stock of goods that we provide for sale to only the most dedicated of friends to Ogri'la. You are one such friend, George. When you find the time, go and speak with him. As we understand it, he has prepared a little something for you as a token of our appreciation. 
Slay Chancellor Bloodleaf and Corok the Mighty and recover Illidan's Command. Use the Wildhammer Flare Gun to signal another Wildhammer Gryphon Rider once you have accomplished this task. Speak with Thane Yoregar at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley should you lose your Wildhammer Flare Gun and require a replacement.	Blood Elf + Giant = ???	At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. What are giants even doing here? Something is just not right about all of this, grunt. I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun. 
Obtain Lianthe's Key from any of the blood elves at Eclipse Point and use it to open Lianthe's Strongbox and claim the Rod of Lianthe. Return the rod to Parshah in the Magma Fields.	The Rod of Lianthe	The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave. We can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them. One of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, George. 
Find Tyri at the north end of the Celestial Ridge and speak with her.	Formal Introductions	Greetings, George. Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves. The ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further. 
Investigate the cause of the water depletion at Umbrafen Lake. Then return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake	We came to Outland expecting to find small pockets of life. What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem. Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however. The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements. The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous. Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion. 
The Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim was attacked by Quillfang Ravagers while camped in Dustquill Ravine. Find her camp and search it for the missing pack.	A Pilgrim's Plight	That wounded pilgrim seems to be shouting something about a pack. When you encountered her, did you see a pack nearby? Hmm...She must've left it when fleeing from her attackers. The quillfang ravagers, in their ravine to the south, are known to attack solitary travelers. If she doesn't calm down, I won't be able to tend her wounds. Her stubbornness may just cost her her life. Go to Dustquill Ravine and see if you can find her campsite. I'm willing to bet she left it there. 
Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers.	Daggerfen Deviance	The Kurenai and the draenei don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the Lost Ones. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all. However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the Daggerfen. In their village to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us. We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence. 
Escort Letoll and his crew and protect them while they make their dig. Return to Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Outpost if you succeed.	Digging Through Bones	Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, Human. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees. If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya. 
Speak with Lieutenant Amadi at the old guard tower just west of Honor Hold.	Know your Enemy	Rumors have surfaced that some new breed of orc is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with. If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit. I have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold. And George - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world. 
Try out each of Dertrok's wands on an Arakkoa Ogre Slave, then return to Dertrok. Each wand will require an Infused Vekh'nir Crystal to use.	Trial and Error	I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves. You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area. When you figure out which is best, come back to me. 
Lieutenant Amadi in Honor Hold wants you to bring 1 Cursed Talisman to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point.	Ill Omens	George, in our battles with the Bleeding Hollow clan of fel orcs, we have found upon them foreboding trinkets. These orcs have collected the insignias of fallen Honor Hold soldiers and created cursed talismans from them. We fear the dark magic of the Bleeding Hollow orcs have transformed our insignias into evil charms with powers against us! Find such a talisman from the Bleeding Hollow orcs of Zeth'Gor, to the east, and bring it to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point, northeast of Zeth'Gor. 
You have received an invitation to speak again with Baron Sablemane on some matter of import. Go to him at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Baron Sablemane Has Requested Your Presence	George, while you were out being one hell of a Mechanic, Baron Sablemane sent his pet dragon up here with a message. He's asked for you personally. From what I understand, he wants you to head up his own fight against the gronn. I guess you're the most qualified person in all of Outland to help him, but if I were you, I'd get in contact with a couple of friends first and ask them to join you at the Circle of Blood. 
Defeat 10 enemy players in Halaa and return to Lakoor in Telaar.	In Defense of Halaa	We are not a warlike race, Human. However when war comes to our lands, we do not run away from it. The Alliance and the Horde wage war in the city of Halaa, to the northwest. We do not know what the blood elves are scheming, but any victory for the Horde would be disastrous. The history between our people and the orcs is one of bloodshed and betrayal. Go and slay the enemy in Halaa and you will be rewarded in coin, honor and renown. 
Slay Rajis Fyashe at Serpent Lake and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh for a reward.	Leader of the Bloodscale	A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the Bloodscale naga. The naga sorceress was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh. The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge. 
Speak to Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.	Atonement	Our history with the orcs is one of constant conflict, George. We were once near driven to extinction due to their bloodlust and have since then avoided them even when not under demonic influence. Yet, this retaliation... it's not what Sedai would've wanted. Speak with our elder, Amaan the Wise. He will help shed light on these events. 
Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to bring him 8 Mature Bone Sifter Carcasses.	Fumping	How would you like to do a little more work for the Explorers' League? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued. I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample. 
Vindicator Vuuleen has asked you to kill Gorr'Dim, leader of the Bladespire Hold ogres. Once you have done so, return to her at Bladespire Hold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Gorr'Dim, Your Time Has Come...	The leader of Bladespire Hold is known as Gorr'Dim. Trust me... the name is appropriate. Still, I wouldn't underestimate him. He's crafty enough to have elevated his clan to be the favorite of Gruul the Dragonkiller and they now dominate these mountains. And Gorr'Dim keeps an entourage about him at all times, including defenders who are sworn not to drink the Bloodmaul brew. For the safety of Sylvanaar, I'm asking that you go back in there and deal with him. 
Bring a Legion Teleporter Control to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. The Mo'arg Weaponsmiths at Legion Hold are known to carry the devices.	Gaining Access	According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's located in the mountains behind our village! The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter at Legion Hold. Certain Legion minions carry a device allowing them to use the teleporter. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed. Do not delay; the enemy is perilously close. 
Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to find the Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit. If you lose your Spectrecles, Chief Apothecary Hildagard can make you a new pair.	Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend	Stories abound about the life of Teron Gorefiend, but most are just that - stories. We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to Draenor. The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once. I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the Altar of Shadows, far to the southeast, across the Netherwing Fields and through Netherwing Pass. Take the Spectrecles and track this orc down. He will surely have more information on Gorefiend. 
Gather 10 Fel Reaver Parts and return them to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.	One Demon's Trash...	You look like a capable young <man/woman>! I was wondering if you could lend me a hand? To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into. It's full of huge fel reaver parts. There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about. I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts! 
Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to return to Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand.	It's Just That Easy?	<Sal'salabim points to the blueprint.>You see where fel cannons are?<Sal'salabim draws an arrow denoting a change of direction.>You turn fel cannon around and use on structures. Wait! Don't be mad! One thing you not know. Overseers have key to turn cannons. You need key first! One from each overseer! Not so easy, eh? Take information back to Altruis. 
Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Ironvine Seeds on the Steam Pump Controls at Serpent Lake, Umbrafen Lake, Marshlight Lake and the Lagoon. Then return to her at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh with any leftover seeds you have.	Balance Must Be Preserved	I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat. What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations. These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth. Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls. The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron. Go, George. Restore the balance that the naga have upset. 
Investigate the Strange Object next to the Broken Corpse to determine what might have befallen the Cenarion Thicket. Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the thicket in Terokkar Forest.	Clues in the Thicket	I have no idea what killed all of the druids here. I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south. Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy. Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us. When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless. 
Gather 6 Feralfen Idols and return them to Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor.	Idols of the Feralfen	From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs. Return to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, George, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them. 
	Have You Ever Seen One of These?	This marsh be missin' one thing, mon! There be no murlocs here. Don't worry, mon, I got a plan to fix the problem. See Gargle 'n' Gurgle over there? I plan to give the gift o' murlocs to the Lost Ones! Take this cage with you to Daggerfen Village an' release 'em in the northeastern cluster of huts. Now you know I can't be riskin' Gargle 'n' Gurgle with you, but I'll give you a cage full o' colorful young murlocs. Just set it on the flat rock you be findin' up there and open the door! 
Locate and speak with Scout Neftis near the south entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.	Speak with Scout Neftis	I am informed that one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village is currently observing a shadowy band that has recently moved in there. George, I want you to speak with Scout Neftis and see how you can assist her in figuring out what this unknown group is up to. Just head south out of here, and then due west, skirting the north of the Bone Wastes. Her last report puts her position near the southern entrance to the village. 
Use the Sanctified Crystal against a wounded Uncontrolled Voidwalker and return to Elsaana at the Temple of Telhamat.	An Ambitious Plan	The blood elves epitomize the irresponsible use of magic, Mechanic. They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics. I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel. 
Speak with Sergeant Altumus at the East Supply Caravan just outside of Honor Hold, to the east.	The Legion Reborn	While the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth, they were also at work here, in Outland. We have tracked their movements over the years, but this latest activity, Mechanic - well, this is beyond anything we've seen. Seek out Sergeant Altumus near the eastern supply caravan. She has been monitoring the invaders and may have insights into their purpose. Be swift - and take care, George - the Burning Legion is not to be underestimated. 
Mordiba wants you to defeat 12 Unyielding Footmen, 8 Unyielding Knights, and 6 Unyielding Sorcerers at the Expedition Armory to the west of Spinebreaker Post.	Make Them Listen	I was sent here to make contact with the Unyielding spirits. These once proud Alliance soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west. If they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally. Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies. But these undead are mad with hatred and will not listen to me. Perhaps they can be forced to join us. 
Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 10 Airy Souls.	Enraged Spirits of Air	Venture southeast, hero. When you see fields of gigantic blue crystals jutting out from the land, you will have reached your destination. It is there, at the Netherwing Fields, that you will find the enraged spirits of air. They roam the cliffs and mountain bases that surround the fields. Destroy their tortured forms and capture their souls with the totem of spirits. Return to me when this is done. 
Slay 20 Eclipsion Soldiers, 10 Eclipsion Cavaliers, and 5 Sons of Corok and then use the Wildhammer Flare Gun to signal another Wildhammer Gryphon Rider to report your task complete. Speak with Thane Yoregar at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley should you lose your Wildhammer Flare Gun and require a replacement.	Breaching the Path	We're going to need more time, Human. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other gryphon riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us! Call for a gryphon rider with the Wildhammer flare gun once you have thinned their numbers. 
Go to Manaforge Duro and retrieve the Sunfury Military Briefing and the Sunfury Arcane Briefing from the Sunfury units stationed there. Return to Exarch Orellis when you've completed this task. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Sunfury Briefings	Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, George. Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it. Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication. We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures. It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings. Obtain them and bring them to me. 
	Magisters' Terrace Reward Quest	 
Fahssn at the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh wants you to bring him 6 Bog Lord Tendrils.	Natural Enemies	Us sporelings and the bog lords have never gotten along well. In the past, we've managed to keep them at bay with spears and stones. Lately they seem to have become more aggressive... or more desperate. They do not fear us or our weapons. You are much scarier and better armed than us. If you were to fight the boglords for us, we'd be forever in your debt! Bring me their tendrils so I know how many you've killed. 
Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to use your Phase Disruptor when you get in range of the Void Conduit that rests atop Ultris. Drop as many charges of the Phase Disruptor as you can to ensure total annihilation. The Phase Disruptor charges will automatically home in on the Void Conduit so long as you are close enough to use it. Return to Professor Dabiri should you succeed!	On Nethery Wings	Here it is, George. Take this phase disruptor and mount up! The Protecotrate nether drake will fly you close enough to Ultris so that you can drop the disruptor on top of the void conduit. Drop as many disruptor charges as possible to ensure complete annihilation! When you are ready, speak with the nether drake and he'll take you up. If you miss the mark you will have to get more bombs from me before you can go up again. 
Travel to Shattrath City and speak with Rilak.	Return to Shattrath	Your actions, while brave, will surely rouse a vindictive response from Terokk. Hurry to Shattrath. Send word to Rilak! 
Lieutenant General Orion at the Dark Portal in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring Orion's Report to Vlagga Freyfeather.	Arrival in Outland	Aided by the Alliance, my forces will hold the line here, but I need you to deliver my report to General Krakork in Thrallmar. With his help, we'll be able to drive these demons back into the abyss that spawned them! Speak to Vlagga Freyfeather who stands on the platform behind us. She'll speed you on your way. 
Take the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg and use it in an attempt to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk. If you're successful, return to Borgrim at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Getting the Bladespire Tanked	I'll not take another sip of that ill-smelling muck! But it does give me an idea.<Borgrim gets a twinkle in his eye.>So here's the plan. We know that the Bloodmaul practically live off of this swill. But I wonder what their enemies, the Bladespire ogres, think of it? George, I want you to take the rest of this rubbish and see if you can get the Bladespire ogres tanked. You can find them by heading north from Bloodmaul Outpost through the ravine. 
Dizzy Dina wants you to kill 10 Ridgespine Stalkers. After you have done so, return to her at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Ridgespine Menace	We hired on to help Toshley when he decided to move to Outland, and we've been on the move ever since. Now it looks like we've finally put down some roots. All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us Roughriders are here to protect them. What we need right now is for you to go north into Razor Ridge, or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers. They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersby. 
Collect 10 Illidari Tabards and then use the Kor'kron Flare Gun to signal another Kor'kron Wind Rider. Speak with Overlord Or'barokh at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley should you lose your Kor'kron Flare Gun and require a replacement.	Tabards of the Illidari	The wind riders must return to Shadowmoon Village to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear. When you have collected enough tabards, call for a wind rider using the Kor'kron flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, Human! 
Equip the Unfinished Headpiece, travel to the Altar of Damnation, and use it while standing near Gul'dan. When the headpiece is energized, return to Parshah in the Magma Fields.	Imbuing the Headpiece	The staff is nearly finished! All that remains is to imbue the headpiece with power flowing from the echoes of Gul'dan in this accursed place. To the east, near the Fel Pits and south of the Deathforge, is the Altar of Damnation. There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm. 
Obtain a set of Sunfury Arcanist Robes, one pair of Sunfury Researcher Gloves and a Sunfury Guardsman Medallion and bring them to Caledis Brightdawn at Manaforge Coruu in Netherstorm. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	A Convincing Disguise	Infiltrating the ranks of Kael's army will not be an easy task. With my knowledge of illusionary magic I could pass you off as one of Kael's followers, but there are certain details in their uniforms I could not replicate. Bring me a set of their robes, a pair of their gloves and a Sunfury guardsman medallion. This will make the results of my magic much more convincing. 
Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 25 Boulderfist Warriors and 25 Boulderfist Mages.	An Audacious Advance	Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin. Within the basin are the twin clefts of Nagrand: Northwind and Southwind. Boulderfist shock troops use the clefts to hide their ogre mounds. I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har. 
Defeat Skra'gath. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.	The Ring of Blood: Skra'gath	You're murderin' 'em out there, kid! They got a ringer for the next match. They say he's a void lord or something... No way do they want you up against their champion. Did you here that palooka, Mogor, yapping at you? The bets are through the roof! Get in that ring and take this one out fast! 
Bring 30 Olemba Seeds to Rakoria in Stonebreaker Hold.	Olemba Seed Oil	The oily seeds from the forest's olemba trees could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it. Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste! Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place. 
Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to recover 8 Fragments of Dimensius.	Recipe for Destruction	Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius. To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work. 
Jenai Starwhisper wants you to report to Lieutenant Meridian at the Allerian Post in Terokkar Forest.	Report to the Allerian Post	This calls for immediate action! We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with. He'll have a better idea of what our next step should be. Report to Lieutenant Meridian out at the Allerian Post and apprise him of the situation. You'll find the post to the northeast on the southern bank of the river just south of Firewing Point. Godspeed, George. 
Gather 5 Parched Hydra Samples and 5 Withered Bog Lord Samples and bring them to Ruam at Telredor.	Withered Flesh	We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants. It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too. Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area. 
Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to return to Sedai's Corpse, northeast of the Temple of Telhamat, and use the Seer's Relic at that location. Return to him after you've completed this task.	The Seer's Relic	The stubborn close their mind and convince themselves of one truth. The wise keep an open mind to the different possibilities leading to and stemming from the present. Take this relic with you to where you found Sedai. See not with your eyes, George, but with your mind. 
Kirrik the Awakened wants you to speak with Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City district of Shattrath.	Speak with Rilak the Redeemed	You look surprised to be talking to me. I do not blame you. My people, the arakkoa, deserve to be feared. Speak with Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City if you wish to know more. He can be found in the northern part of the Lower City, with the other outcasts of Skettis. And, George, we will speak again. 
Rina Moonspring has asked you to bring her 4 Thunderlord Dire Wolf Tails. After doing so, return to her at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Marauding Wolves	The filthy races of the Horde have taken over a settlement to the east. They've brought with them a large pack of the dire wolves that they prefer to use as mounts and sentries. These sentries have been marauding across the bridge that separates us. They've been stalking our fey drakes, which are critical to the pollination of the Living Grove. Use the east exit to traverse the bridge over Bloodmaul Ravine that leads to the Jagged Ridge to the east, and bring me their tails as proof! 
Arcanist Thelis wants you to enter the Warden's Cage, south of the Ruins of Baa'ri and interrogate Sanoru on Akama's whereabouts. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	The Warden's Cage	The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion. The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half. I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning. He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage. I want you to find that dreaded prison, and find the whereabouts of Akama. His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to. 
Nazgrel in Thrallmar wants you to attack Forge Camp: Mageddon and kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and return with the head of Razorsaw.	Forge Camp: Mageddon	George, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The Legion's gan'arg servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen. Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's fel reaver production will grind to a halt! 
Slay Overmaster Grindgarr. Then return to Wind Trader Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing in the Netherstorm.	Dealing with the Overmaster	I used to be the foreman here. But now that I've been demoted, I've come to realize our pilgrimage from Quel'Thalas to Outland was all a lie. A lie perpetrated by Kael'thas to strengthen his forces here in the Netherstorm. I've tried to convince my brethren that we should leave, especially with the Burning Legion here, but they are all too stubborn. Do me a favor? Kill Overmaster Grindgarr. Then return to your ethereal and tell him that I am no longer his enemy. 
Gather 30 Olemba Seeds and return them to Ros'eleth in the Allerian Stronghold.	Olemba Seeds	Aren't the trees in the forest beautiful? I've often wondered if they would survive on Azeroth. I'm hesitant to send back seedlings, though. It's a rough trip and they're much harder to transport than something like a sack of seeds. The seeds are stored in tough cones that fall from the tree's branches once they've reached maturity. If you come upon some of those cones in your travels, would you mind bringing some of the seeds back to me? 
Search for Scout Jyoba.	Searching for Scout Jyoba	Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The Dead Mire, we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either. Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, George? 
Speak with Ghabar at the Stormspire.	To the Stormspire	Master Engineer Ghabar will want to know about the results of the diagnostics. If anything, they caution us to keep a close eye on the workings of our dome generators. As the fields become more and more unstable, their effects will become harder to control. It could spell disaster for our expedition and anything else housed within the domes. You'll find Ghabar at the Stormspire. Just follow the road north from this eco-dome and across the bridge. It'll lead you to the elevator at the base of the spire. 
Bring the Daggerfen Poison Manual and a Daggerfen Poison Vial to Timothy Daniels at the Orebor Harborage.	Secrets of the Daggerfen	Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them. Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen. The whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial. 
Amaan the Wise wants you to travel to the Pools of Aggonar and use the Cleansing Vial at Aggonar's corpse. Return to him when Aggonar's essence is cleansed from the water.	Cleansing the Waters	I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion. Now that the demonic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse. You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools. Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left this world. 
Toshley wants you to use the Repolarized Magneto Sphere to absorb 25 lightning strikes from the Scalewing Serpents. As well, collect 5 Scalewing Lightning Glands. Then, deliver them back to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Ride the Lightning	We haven't kept the use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium under budget. But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the Scalewing Shelf to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of. I've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents. 
Baron Sablemane has told you to bring him 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands. Return to him at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have procured them.	Into the Churning Gulch	Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return. There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway. So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters. You'll find them in the Churning Gulch to the southwest. Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it! 
Commander Haephus Stonewall has asked you to kill Dorgok at Bloodmaul Camp. Return to him at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done the deed.	A Date with Dorgok	Good, I've seen you around and I've been meaning to speak to you about a matter of some importance. There are reports coming in that for some reason the Bloodmaul ogres are planning an offensive against Sylvanaar and Ruuan Weald. We don't know who or what is pushing them to do this, but I intend to nip their plan in the bud! Bloodmaul Camp is where the attacks are to be staged from. Head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald and you will find it. I want you to kill their leader, Dorgok! 
Travel to Manaforge Coruu and slay 8 Sunfury Arcanists and 5 Sunfury Researchers. Return to Exarch Orelis when you've completed this task. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Attack on Manaforge Coruu	Your success at Manaforge B'naar was quite noteworthy. I'm sure that Anchorite Karja will ask you for a repeat performance at Manaforge Coruu next. We've learned of a particularly important regiment of Sunfury arcanists and researchers being deployed there and I would like you to target them. Succeed and you will deliver a crushing blow against our enemy's forces. 
Ryathen the Somber at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 6 Felblood Samples from the Terrorfiends that inhabit the Pools of Aggonar.	In Need of Felblood	Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar. Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the demon Aggonar was spilled into them. That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power. Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood. Slay them and retrieve as much felblood as you can. I'll make it worth your while. 
Bring the Cabal Orders to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan in Terokkar Forest.	Cabal Orders	This message bears a dark seal and though the language seems somewhat familiar, it appears to be encoded. Perhaps someone at the Refugee Caravan will know something about it. 
Retrieve Vindicator Vuuleen's Blade and Vindicator Vuuleen's Shield. Then return them to Vindicator Vuuleen at Bladespire Hold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Trappings of a Vindicator	I know it's strange, but I do want to stay in this cage. It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the Bladespire. I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back. Two of their leaders have my trappings. Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield. If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink! 
	Entry Into the Citadel	This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort. From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel. Maybe this could prove to interest to Danath, the force commander at Honor Hold. 
Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to bring him 15 Digested Caracoli.	A Rare Bean	You are ill-equipped to face the restless elements of Nagrand. Before you can help the Earthen Ring, you must help yourself. To the west you will find dung heaps left behind by the wildlife of Nagrand. You must search the dung for the digested remnants of the Nagrand caracoli. From this bean I am able to make a tablet that will aid you in your battle against the restless forces of nature. Return to me when you have collected no less than two fists worth of caracoli... Ogre sized fists. 
Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	A Gift for Voren'thal	I don't want to send you to Voren'thal empty-handed. It's not in my style to be underwhelming. To gain access to Socrethar's Seat in the north, we'll need to use his own teleporters - locked by Socrethar's teleportation stone. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base Oblivion. The second half is held by the demon Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. Obtain these and Voren'thal will be impressed beyond words. 
Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Dumphry at Honor Hold.	Waste Not, Want Not	Reinforcements are great, but I don't see 'em haulin' any wagons loaded with ingots or timber. Take a look around, friend. Trees are in short supply, and the mines are overrun with Legion scum. I'm in a bad way fer supplies, and I'm makin' what substitutions I can, but it's time to start reusing what we can. The southern edge of the Path o' Glory is strewn with the ruins of siege machinery. Some pieces of 'em are still usable. Feeling up to a bit o' a salvage operation? 
Acquire Stronglimb Deeproot's Trunk and deliver it to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Felling an Ancient Tree	WANTED! Stronglimb Deeproot, ancient of war and chief defender of the Living Grove south of Sylvanaar. Find him by heading west across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine. Return his hewn trunk to Tor'chunk Twoclaws inside the Thunderlord Stronghold inn. 
Mar'nah at Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to travel to Razorthorn Rise in Outlands, collect 5 Razorthorn Roots, and return to her.	Discovering Your Roots	Greetings, Human. I'm afraid I have little to offer here until my reagents are stocked. Of the supplies I require, there is a special reagent, razorthorn root, that is particularly difficult to harvest. Fortunately, I know a secret....Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root. To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise. 
Venture out into the Ruuan Weald and slay 10 Wyrmcult Hewers, then return to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	...and a Time for Action	We will not stand idly by while they decimate the Ruuan Weald around us. Our first priority must be to the trees. Mechanic, I want you to go back out into the Weald and deliver a very different message for us. I want you to slay every one of their hewers that you come into contact with! If they will not listen to reason, perhaps they will listen to a more assertive method of persuasion! 
Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in Forge Camp: Rage and return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.	Cannons of Rage	There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons. George, you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the Legion from raining fiery hell down upon our heads! 
Assistant Klatu has informed you that Force Commander Danath Trollbane has been seeking you. Speak to him in the barracks at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.	Trollbane is Looking for You	While we were busy, a messenger was waiting out in the hall. I suppose he grew tired, or perhaps he simply ran away at the sight of Jules floating around the room. Either way, Force Commander Danath is looking for you. I suggest that you seek an audience with him inside the barracks as quickly as possible! 
Obtain 4 Flawless Crystal Shards from the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins and return them to Ravandwyr at Area 52.	Rebuilding the Staff	<Ravandwyr inspects the staff, noting that part of the headpiece seems to be missing.>Simply barbaric! Ekkorash must've taken the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket, not realizing that it works in concert with the rest of the staff. As long as it remains broken, the staff's power is greatly diminished. With a suitable draenei crystal, I should be able to repair it. I've heard the goblins remarking about the crystals carried by the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins to the north. 
Use the Protectorate Igniter on 12 Withered Corpses. Return the Protectorate Igniter to Agent Araxes outside of Access Shaft Zeon when the task is complete.	The Flesh Lies...	You see these corpses, Human? Arconus is responsible for this slaughter. He's sucked them dry, leaving nothing more than a fleshy husk. But don't let the bodies fool you! Inside those corpses lie flesh beasts, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting fool that gets too close. I've got my orders. I must remain here until backup arrives. That doesn't mean that you can't take my igniter and destroy the withered corpses that litter the mines. One way or another, the mission must be completed. 
Speak to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	The Cenarion Expedition	The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost. Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh. Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there. 
Kronk has asked you to use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror atop the Blade's Edge Mountains. Return it to him once you have done so.	Banish the Demons	You've arrived at the perfect time, friend! We are in need of assistance. In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end. We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the Skyguard. The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies! But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came! 
Bring the Sketh'lon War Totem to Parshah in the Magma Fields.	Asghar's Totem	What you read in the commander's journal is true. While the orcish Horde massed under Gul'dan, my people sought to defend ourselves from the threat by striking against him. Gul'dan learned of their intentions and cast a mighty spell that destroyed our camps and twisted the spirits of my brothers. They must be stopped before they unleash a greater evil. In the Sketh'lon Wreckage to the north, seek out Asghar and bring me the totem he carries. With it, we can begin to thwart the dark conclave's plans. 
Return to Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 in Netherstorm.	Return to Thalodien	It would be best if this information got back to Thalodien as soon as possible. I'll stay here and cover our tracks. It wouldn't do us much good to have Kael'thas find out what we were snooping around here. Secret information is always better if your enemy doesn't know you have it. 
Ohlorn Farstrider wants you to speak with Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.	The Nesingwary Safari	These orcs have never seen a tauren before - if you can believe such a thing. If it weren't for Captain Kroghan, they would have probably been serving me for their next meal right about now. But where are my manners? I am Ohlorn Farstrider, hunter extraordinaire! I am part of the Nesingwary expedition that came up here from Azeroth in search of big game. If you are interested in the hunt, perhaps you should visit my crew at the Nesingwary Safari, due east of here near the border of Zangarmarsh. 
Return to Manaforge Duro and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from Overseer Athanel. Use it at the Duro Control Console to shut it down and report back to Spymaster Thalodien. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Shutting Down Manaforge Duro	So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control? What a dilemma! If Duro goes down, then Tempest Keep goes down. Only drawback is... if Tempest Keep is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it. Dead Kael'thas is good. Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose. It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames. The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel. 
Noraani at Telredor wants you to bring her 8 Eel Filets.	Umbrafen Eel Filets	It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago. Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others. If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet. 
Destroy 10 Lost Spirits and 10 Broken Skeletons, and then speak with Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest.	Helping the Lost Find Their Way	Many spirits of the draenei were corrupted by the explosion of Auchindoun. Now they wander the wastes in torment. George, I beseech you to put them to rest. Destroy the lost spirits and broken skeletons that haunt the Bone Wastes beyond Auchindoun's walls. What? You think leaving them to wander in blind agony would be better? Afterward, return to Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan and tell him of that which you have done. 
Ethan wants you to find 12 of his missing friends in Veil Skith and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan.	Missing Friends	We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise. It was scary. I don't know when we are going to get moving again. Some of my friends are missing though. I don't know where they are. I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest. They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff. If you find them that would be great. I'm kind of worried about them. 
Rokgah Bloodgrip has tasked you with the retrieval of the Thunderspike. Return it to her at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Thunderspike	If the vision that I granted you is true, then you must travel down into the ravine and to the south end of Bloodmaul Ravine. There you will find the Draenethyst Mine. Journey to the back of the mine, and retrieve the Thunderspike. Ignore everything else! I have no interest in the crystals of the mine, nor the ogres therein. As soon as you have the spear return it to me here! And, George, be very careful with it... I would hate to think what would happen to you should you break it. 
	More Tendrils!	 
Kill Overlord Gorefist, 10 Ango'rosh Maulers, and 10 Ango'rosh Souleaters and report back to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.	Us or Them	In order to end the Ango'rosh threat, we must kill their leader, Overlord Gorefist. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers. Go to the Ango'rosh Stronghold and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the Ango'rosh Camp. Show no mercy, George. They certainly wouldn't spare any of us. 
Travel to Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains and speak with Nekthar.	The Ogre Threat	As if the naga and their allies weren't enough, the ogres are extending their reach in the marsh. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left. For each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold Zabra'jin once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome. 
Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to slay 12 Auchenai Initiates and 5 Auchenai Doomsayers.	A Hero Is Needed	It is not enough. A hero is needed. Our forces are overwhelmed as the Auchenai continue to grow in number.<Commander Ra'vaj looks at you.>Will you be the hero? Return to the field of battle and strike at their soldiers. Keep them occupied so that my scouts can get behind their lines and see what they are creating. 
Gather 8 Sketh'lon Feathers and bring them to Parshah in the Magma Fields.	Sketh'lon Feathers	There is one last element missing from the staff. We must direct the staff's power toward the Dark Conclave spirits. We can do that by gathering feathers scattered on the ground at the Sketh'lon Base Camp and using them in the staff. The base camp is to the south, east of Wildhammer Stronghold. Gul'dan's magic utterly destroyed my brethren, leaving only their spirits, but it did not stop there. The magic fed on the spell the arakkoa were preparing, forging a sinister force that engulfed the spirits. 
Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Hail, Commander!	Captain George!<Taskmaster Varkule salutes you.>Overlord Mor'ghor has asked to see you in his chambers at once! 
Speak to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Valley in Outland.	Warchief's Command: Shadowmoon Valley!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Valley in Outland. The Burning Legion is attempting to lay siege to Shadowmoon Village, but our elite Kor'kron force is showing them what it means to fight against the Horde. Crush the Legion. For the Horde! 
Take Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light on the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	Ishanah's Help	The time has come to face Socrethar, George. Confronting an eredar leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us. A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared. Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City. She will determine how we need to handle the situation. 
Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to Taela Everstride at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.	WANTED: Bonelashers Dead!	A bounty is declared on the bonelashers of the Bone Wastes. As known carriers of the plague, they are to be destroyed forthwith! While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at Carrion Hill in the north. Report to Taela Everstride afterward to collect your reward. 
Return the Eroded Leather Case to Thiah Redmane, camped near the Ruins of Sha'naar in western Hellfire Peninsula.	Missing Missive	Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out. The only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member. 
Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners.	Minions of the Shadow Council	<Zagran listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding.>That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that. The Shadow Council has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge! 
Mosswood the Ancient wants you to kill 8 Scorch Imps and then return to him in Ruuan Weald.	Little Embers	Northeast of here, on the plateau above us lies the burnt ashes of my ancient home. A great wood flourished there before the Burning Legion sent their imps to burn us away. So many died that even centuries later my tired old heart hungers for revenge. There are too many of them for us to ever reclaim the land, but you could make them afraid. Surely you will help me? 
Destroy a Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula and plunge the Unfired Key Mold into its remains. Bring the Charred Key Mold to Dumphry in Honor Hold.	Hotter than Hell	It's not working, <lad/lass>. I cannot give it enough heat... the materials will not be properly tempered. You know, the Fel Reavers used by the Burning Legion are powered by a scalding core of fel fire - it burns much hotter than normal fire. If you could find enough people to take one down, you could heat the mold in the insides of the fallen reaver. Beware, Mechanic, those fel reavers pack quite a punch. 
Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you bring him 15 Enraged Crusher Cores.	Eating Damnation	<Gordawg picks up a rock and begins to chew on it.>Gordawg tastes. Gordawg knows where this earth has been.<Gordawg raises one of his massive legs and stomps the ground.>Look. See Nagrand.<Gordawg directs you to the imprint of his foot. Within the imprint you see what appears to be a perfect geological map of Nagrand, marked with the locations of where you can find the elementals Gordawg wants you to destroy.>BREAK THEM! Bring Gordawg the pieces to eat. Take the map. 
Speak with Olrokk at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley.	Learning to Fly	Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his/her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place. I understand the feeling completely. You, my friend, need to head to Shadowmoon Village in the northwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Olrokk about some flight instruction. Mind you, his training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while. 
Windcaller Blackhoof wants you to speak to the ancients Ashyen and Keleth at Cenarion Refuge and obtain their blessings.	Blessings of the Ancients	You've earned the trust of the Cenarion Expedition, George. It is time you spoke to the ancients allied with our cause, Ashyen and Keleth, and asked for their blessing. Carrying the mark of an ancient will fill you with great power. These boons will become more powerful as your renown among us increases. Go, George, and ask the ancients for their blessing. 
Bring 8 vials of Warp Chaser Blood to Sab'aoth at Cosmowrench.	Bloody Imp-ossible!	The blood of the warp chasers in this area is a powerful and rare reagent. It's one of my biggest sellers. Normally, I take my imp, Zeppit, out to help me gather it. Warp chaser blood is simply too caustic to be handled safely by you or I, but it doesn't bother Zeppit. Things are getting busier here at the shop, so if I send Zeppit with you, will you help gather the blood? Zeppit's attention tends to wander, so you'll need to be close to the chaser when it dies for Zeppit to do his work. 
Bring Stonegazer's Blood to Sha'nir in Shattrath City. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	A Cure for Zahlia	The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head. She survived, but lost her eyesight. A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old basilisk. Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, Terokkar basilisks don't tend to live very long. There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling. It is known only as ""Stonegazer"" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge. Bring me its blood so that Zahlia may see once again. 
Speak with Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold.	Zorus the Judicator	The history of Shadowmoon Valley is a long and troubled one. Few delve into it for fear of breathing new life into the unspeakable atrocities that took place there. Not all are so timid, though. Zorus the Judicator searches for the truth about the ghosts of Shadowmoon's past. It is a staggering undertaking, one with which he would welcome help, I'm sure. If you should venture into the valley, look for Zorus at Wildhammer Stronghold, in the central portion of the valley's southern region. 
Blow the Unyielding Battle Horn near the Alliance Banner. Kill Urtrak and then return to Althen the Historian at Spinebreaker Post.	Bloody Vengeance	East of here is an old destroyed Alliance siege tower. Now scavengers loot it for old nails and bits of scrap. Long ago, many Alliance warriors lost their lives at this tower and their banner was captured by Urtrak, a foul orc commander. Blow the Unyielding battle horn near the Alliance banner. This will get the attention of Urtrak. It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago. 
Deliver the Orb of the Grishna to Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Truth Unorbed	This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the arakkoa. Suffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat. Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack. Perhaps Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the Wyrmskull Bridge, would be interested in examining it? 
Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.	Intercepting the Mana Cells	I have devised a plan to acquire a power source strong enough for the creation of our portal. The ethereal forces at Bash'ir Landing, atop the northwestern Blade's Edge Mountains, have been smuggling mana cells out of Tempest Keep and transporting them to the Sunwell for Kael'thas. They have hidden the cells, but there is a way for you to find them; the ethereal carry phase devices that you can use to see the smuggled goods. Just beware the mana cells' phase wyrm guardians. 
	Membership Benefits	 
Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 15 Boulderfist Crushers and 15 Boulderfist Mystics.	Message in a Battle	Ogres are moved by one thing: Might. If we expose ourselves to them as being weak, they will take advantage of that weakness and wipe us out. Garrosh might be ready to lie down and let the ogre dogs take our lands but I am not! I need you to deliver a message to the Boulderfist, George. The only type of message that they are capable of understanding: Brutality. Travel to the Burning Blade Ruins, southeast of here and show them the might of the Mag'har. And George, check in with the others before leaving. 
Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay 15 Warmaul Brutes and 15 Warmaul Warlocks.	War on the Warmaul	We were en route to the Ancestral Grounds when we were ambushed by Warmaul. They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon. And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low. I am a spiritual orc, George, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them! 
Deliver the Surveying Equipment to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.	An Audience with the Prince	Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally. I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead. It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the Netherstorm. Seek out his chamber atop the Stormspire to the north. He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address. 
	Mana-Tombs Reward Quest	 
Bring ""Count"" Ungula's Mandible to Watcher Leesa'oh.	The Count of the Marshes	This bloody mandible comes from an unbelievably large creature. The nether ray that it belonged to has to be the largest ever seen in Zangarmarsh. Judging from the condition of the mandible, the count must've abandoned a diet of carrion in favor of living flesh. Surely the Cenarion Expedition would be interested in such a specimen. Watcher Leesa'oh has a small camp to the west of Quagg Ridge. 
Seek out and slay Painmistress Gabrissa at Illidari Point and return to the corpse of Ar'tor, Son of Oronok with the Crystalline Key.	Demonic Crystal Prisons	From assessing the scene, you note that Ar'tor is being held in place by energy beams emanating from the crystals hovering around the rune. Try as you might, Ar'tor is unmovable. You note that the crystals have an empty slot at their base - perhaps for a key. It also seems as if succubi periodically perform some sort of ritual at the site. Search Illidari Point for their leader. Perhaps she holds the key to releasing Ar'tor. 
Bring the Mystery Mask to Wildlord Antelarion in Ruuan Weald.	Mystery Mask	Ok, it should work now. What is it, you ask? Why, it's a communication device - it allows those blockheads to communicate with each other. You know, the Burning Legion! I would suggest that you hand this mask to Wildlord Antelarion. He's over there pacing around. Always moving, he is. Well get moving, he's been trying to get his hands on one of these for sometime now. 
Obtain the Lexicon Demonica from Grandmaster Vorpil and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.	The Lexicon Demonica	Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic. It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock. Deep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me. 
Deliver the Etherlithium Matrix Crystals to Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Report to Engineering	George! I need you to take all of these etherlithium crystals over to Chief Engineer Trep, my, uh, chief of engineering. He should know what to do with them. And if he doesn't, you see to it that he finds out! 
Return to Garadar and speak to Greatmother Geyah.	Return to the Greatmother	Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar with news of your victory, George. This will surely lift the spirits of the Mag'har. Perhaps even the young Hellscream will be lifted from his malaise. 
Commander Skyshadow has asked you to look in the southern area of the Jagged Ridge of the Blade's Edge Mountains for a clue as to the whereabouts of Toshley and the other gnomes.	Where Did Those Darn Gnomes Go?	Despite the good that we've done here, I feel bad about one thing: driving Toshley and his gnome friends away. We had no choice; they were making a mess of our efforts in the grove with all of their technology and experimentation. I would appreciate it if you would find out what became of them. Last we heard, they headed east across the bridge. I'm certain that they must have turned south, away from Thunderlord Stronghold. Look for a clue as to their whereabouts in the southern Jagged Ridge. 
Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring her 15 Ever-burning Ash samples.	A Haunted History	Have you felt the cold chill? Perhaps what you thought was a hand on your shoulder? That was not your mind playing tricks on you, Human. The land is haunted. Ghosts litter the landscape, stuck here for all eternity. Would you like to see them? Are you sure about that? These types of things tend to change a person - and not for the better. Very well, I will need you to collect for me the ever-burning ash that is found near any of the fel lava pools of western Shadowmoon. Anywhere near green lava... 
Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to defeat 20 Severed Spirits in Kirin'Var's Town Square.	Malevolent Remnants	Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger. It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger. 
Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Theloria Shadecloak at Allerian Post.	Unruly Neighbors	The recent arrival of the fel orcs at the ruins to the east both puzzles and troubles Thander. They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings. The construction goes on day and night, George. I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions. 
Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 1 Overdeveloped Felfire Gizzard.	The Second Course...	I remember seeing larger diemetradons east of the Hand of Gul'dan, near the lava flows around the Ruins of Baa'ri. What I want you to get for me now is one overdeveloped felfire gizzard from the beasts around that area. You might have to kill several to find a gizzard like the one I described. Keep at it! One of them is bound to have my next meal. 
Escort the Maxx A. Million Mk. V through the Ruins of Enkaat and back out to safety. Then speak with Bot-Specialist Alley just outside the Ruins of Enkaat in the Netherstorm.	Mark V is Alive!	Greetings, Human. I am charged up and fully functional. There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve. I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers. Handling them with care will not be an issue. However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection. 
Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Thander at the Allerian Stronghold.	Stymying the Arakkoa	We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers. My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them. 
Take the Withered Basidium to Ruam in Telredor.	Withered Basidium	A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform. Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium. 
Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Reavij at Swamprat Post.	The Respect of Another	Magasha is the fiercest troll in the Marsh, but she only respects mighty hunters. I tried to prove myself to her, but the one beast that could impress her is beyond my skill. Maybe you could help me out? It's the giant bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. If you bring me its stinger maybe she'll give me a chance to join her hunters. I know it's a little sneaky, but I promise to learn under her and do ya both proud. 
Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar and retrieve 10 Sha'naar Relics.	Sha'naar Relics	As I've told you before, I do not require eyes to see what others cannot. I will not pass judgment on what you did on Makuru's behalf, yet I think you need to see beyond what your eyes show you. Travel southwest to the Ruins of Sha'naar and salvage any relics you find. If fate wills it you will find what we need. The meaning of my request might not be immediately apparent. Have faith though, George. Clarity comes to those with patience. 
Silmara at Mok'Nathal Village wants you to collect 12 Iridescent Wings.	The Softest Wings	Hunting silkwing larva is a difficult challenge for our young warriors, but luckily, even if they fail to harvest the cocoon from the larva, we can still use the wings of hatched silkwings. In fact, we use the wings for much more than the cocoons, and we can never have too many. If you'll be out there, it would be a great help if you could bring me some. 
	Return to the Scryers	This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold... No! It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of. Return to those who sent you here, George. You now have the means to stop Varedis. Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence. That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power. 
Speak with Brunn Flamebeard at Wildhammer Stronghold.	Building a Better Gryphon	I've heard that the Wildhammer dwarves maintain a gryphon roost at their fortress down in southern Shadowmoon Valley. If you're going down there, would you speak to them on my behalf? I have some ideas on how to improve their gryphons! Why stop at armoring them when you could attach an altimeter, a rear view mirror, and rocket? Imagine how fast you could go with one of those babies strapped to your gryphon's back! I'll call it the TurboGryphon 8000! 
Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you recover the Master Planner's Blueprints.	The Master Planner	All forge camps have a master planner. The master planner dictates what types of structures are present at a forge camp and how each structure is situated. Moreover, this information is kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carries around on their person. We need the master planner's blueprints. Armed with such exacting information, we could persuade an acquaintance of mine to lend some assistance. Find the mo'arg master planner and take his blueprints. He will be stationed behind the forges. 
Take the Vial of Void Horror Ooze to Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.	The Horrors of Pollution	You carefully fill a vial with the fallen void horror's ooze. Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post would be quite interested in such a find! Take it to him at once! 
Retrieve 5 of Lathrai's Stolen Goods. Return them to Wind Trader Lathrai near the World's End Tavern in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.	A Personal Favor	Hmmm? A box you say? Or was it several? Do you know what material the box was constructed from? And what was the name of this merchant? Empoor? Are you certain that he's one of the Broken? I don't do much business with their kind. Perhaps my memory would be jogged if you were to do me a favor? The Skithian arakkoa - primitive casters that they are - recently stole a huge shipment of my more exotic goods. I want it all back! You can find Veil Skith just to the south of Shattrath City. 
Bring 4 Haal'eshi Scrolls to Arcanist Calesthris Dawnstar at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.	Magic of the Arakkoa	Outland holds many secrets, George. It's only a matter of time before we uncover them all. The half-bird, half-man species of the arakkoa possesses ancient arcane knowledge that would aid us greatly in our exploration of this world. Travel to the Den of Haal'esh, south of here. Obtain any magical scrolls that the Haal'eshi might be carrying on them and bring them to me. 
Cleanse 8 Trampled Skeletons on the Path of Glory with Draenei Holy Water, then return to Warp-Scryer Kryv at Honor Hold.	The Path of Glory	The 'Path of Glory,' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people. It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light. Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, George, help me in this undertaking. 
Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Eastern Alliance Cannon and the Western Alliance Cannon, and then return to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.	Burn It Up... For the Horde!	I'm a lucky, lucky goblin. I get to make explosives and killing machines, knowing they'll be used immediately on important missions! Speaking of missions, I just got one from Thrallmar command: burn the Alliance cannons on the far side of the Path of Glory... the ones pointing dangerously close to Horde fortifications. Take this torch and make your way to each cannon. Fire the torch and watch the sparks fly! 
	Felspark Ravine	Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground. They have stationed dreadlords in Felspark Ravine, east of here. They are responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion. 
Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you destroy 30 Void Waste Globules and 30 Seeping Sludge Globules.	Electro-Shock Goodness!	Around the ruined manaforge you will find the run-off of Dimensius's handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround Ultris. Directly below those pools, where the Ethereum Staging Grounds now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of void waste. The best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules! 
Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold.	An Unseen Hand	The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Rokag might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to Stonebreaker Hold and show him the map. 
Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold.	Patriarch Ironjaw	You've done well in gathering the first pelts. The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter. In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path. Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored. 
Slay 5 Raging Colossi and then return to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Colossal Menace	You see that huge red crystal to the north? It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake. When we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these colossi wandering about that weren't previously here. There's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that. Those mountain giants are my immediate concern. I want you to head up to Fallen Sky Ridge with some friends and deal with them. 
Report to Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower.	The Deathforge	From your findings at Legion Hold, we know that the Legion's Shadow Council allies are producing infernals in the Deathforge. I've dispatched a small scouting party to keep watch over the area, but they're not able to accomplish everything we need. If the Deathforge is left alone to operate, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold. I want you to meet up with Stormer Ewan Wildwing, at the Deathforge Tower, to the northwest, overlooking the Deathforge itself. 
Stormer Ewan Wildwing at Deathforge Tower wants you to search the Deathforge for Flanis Swiftwing and recover Flanis's Pack.	The Fate of Flanis	Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days. I fear the worst, George. Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected. 
Go to Boulder'mok and collect 3 Grisly Totems from the Boulder'mok ogres. Use Sablemane's Trap at Gorgrom's Altar to set the trap and summon and kill Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater. When Gorgrom is dead, place the 3 Grisly Totems near his corpse, then return to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater	The gronn we seek is Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater. With Sablemane's trap, you will make short work of the gronn. You will find him accepting sacrifices from the ogres of Boulder'mok. Follow the road north from the Circle of Blood, then west at Ruuan Weald. Go northwest through the tunnel. First, kill the ogres for their heads. We will send a message. Set the trap at his altar. When he is dead, plant the grisly totems near him - none can mistake that message. Take the bear.<Misha growls.> 
Bring Albreck's Findings to Apothecary Antonivich in Thrallmar.	Apothecary Antonivich	George, I have prepared a preliminary report of my findings regarding the Bleeding Hollow orcs. My colleague in Thrallmar, Apothecary Antonivich, will be happy to receive them. He too studies the phenomenon of fel orcs... in hopes of preventing such a tragedy from again befalling our orcish allies. Take him this report, and I will continue my study of the blood you brought me. If fortune is with us, we will isolate the cause of the fel orc affliction. 
Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to make contact with Archmage Vargoth. If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.	Curse of the Violet Tower	Now, you will be able to use the archmage's staff to contact him. He resides in the Violet Tower, on an 'island' to the southeast. The tower is both sanctuary and prison to him, cursed as it is. Kirin Tor can neither enter nor leave, keeping me apart from my master. The staff's magic can penetrate the tower's defenses, but only if invoked by one outside the Kirin Tor. Take the archmage's staff and use it to conjure his image. Tell him what has happened and that I have not completely failed him. 
Collect 7 Mana Wraith Essences and return them to Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Essence for the Engines	As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape. Unfortunately, I haven't built them yet. Mechanic, I'm in dire straits here! I have almost all of the parts. All that I'm missing is the engine core. Luckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines. They can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island. Except for here in Area 52, of course. 
Wazat across from Clan Watch in southern Nagrand wants you to bring him 3 Air Elemental Gases.	I Must Have Them!	Do you see them?? By Gazlowe's horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs! Say, you look like you might be of some use. I'll tell you what, Human; if you gather a few items for me to make my Jump-a-tron 4000 functional, I'll give you a key that will let you operate the machine as well! What can you do with a Jump-a-tron 4000 you say? What can't you do is more like it...I'll need air elemental gas from the air elementals of Nagrand. They're all over the place so don't ask me where to find 'em! 
Bring Witch Doctor Tor'gash 6 Burstcap Mushrooms.	Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!	You like mushrooms, mon? There be a powerful one here in Zangarmarsh, growin' real close to Zabra'jin. You gotta be careful, though, mon. They be callin' it the burstcap for a reason. If you be gettin' too close without takin' the proper precautions, it'll blow right up on you! Poof! Right into a cloud o' toxic spores. I been usin' them for readin' the omens, but they be almost gone now. 
Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.	A Mystifying Vision	A strange vision haunts me, George. I see a continuous cloud of smoke ascending toward the sky, left in the wake of a giant fire moving ever faster away. It is not a natural phenomenon, nor a creation of evil; that much I know. I have no knowledge of what it looks like, save that it is the product of the labor of many. Yet, without more hands, it may never come to be. Travel to Netherstorm, Mechanic. Locate those responsible for this creation and offer them your aid. 
Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Far Seer Regulkut at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.	The Warchief's Mandate	As you know, the warchief put his power behind this expedition for one reason. This is the world we came from. This is where our roots lie. This journey means different things to orcs and blood elves. To them it's a search for the promised land. To us it's more like returning home. Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them. This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods. Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do. 
Makuru at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 10 Mag'har Ancestral Beads.	Makuru's Vengeance	Sedai was like a brother to Makuru. We owe him our lives and more! They call Makuru crazy but if the Omenai are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones! Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in this world, but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai. I've seen the brown orc Mag'har grunts before, up in the hills to the northeast. They hate us! They don't deserve our mercy! Go, avenge Sedai! Bring me their ancestral beads as proof! 
Bring Ishaal's Almanac to Rilak the Redeemed in Lower City inside Shattrath.	An Ally in Lower City	There is an arakkoa in Lower City by the name of Rilak... He can be trusted. Take the book... to him.<Adaris drifts into unconsciousness as he returns the book to you.> 
Locate and kill Z'kral in the mines beneath Honor Hold, then report back to Foreman Biggums.	The Mastermind	Those infernal gan'arg keep scurrying into the mine! For each one you kill, two or three more seem to take its place! There's got to be someone down there in the deepest reaches of the mine directing the incursion. You seemed to do well against them last time, and Light knows you're the only one brave enough to venture back into the mine. Find out who's responsible for this disturbance and make him pay! 
Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.	Hero's Call: Terokkar Forest!	We have lost contact with the druids of the Cenarion ThicketThe King has commanded any able bodies of the Alliance to venture into Terokkar Forest and discover what has happened. The thicket can be found by heading northwest through Terokkar Forest from Zangarmarsh. 
Search for crash survivors.	Investigate the Crash	When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a goblin zeppelin crash. It went down to the northwest, beyond the Expedition Armory. The zeppelin was on fire. Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky. Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood. I may have imagined the whole thing. If you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at Spinebreaker Post. 
Speak with Nazgrel in Thrallmar.	Report to Nazgrel	George, during your foray with the Demoniac Scryer, I sent word of your exploits against the fel orcs. Nazgrel, our illustrious leader in Thrallmar, wishes to speak with you. I believe he has a bloody mission in mind... 
Garm Wolfbrother has told you where the Mok'Nathal, Rexxar's people, live. Speak of this to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Spirits Have Voices	George, now that you can see me, there is something you must tell Rexxar. I know that he seeks his people, and I know where they are. The Mok'Nathal, as they are known, have a village to the east beyond the Razor Ridge. Go, give Rexxar this news. His people are in danger, and I know that he will want to come to their aid. 
Tree Warden Chawn has asked you to seek out and speak with Treebole, an ancient of lore who lives in the Raven's Wood of the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Treebole Must Know	This is troubling! The arakkoa are causing the ancients and protectors to become possessed by evil spirits! But, there is one ancient that could not possibly have been affected. His name is Treebole, and you must go to him at once if we're to save the trees of the Raven's Wood! Go back to the Raven's Wood. You will find him at the fork in the path just past Grishnath. 
Kill 40 Murkblood Scavengers and 20 Murkblood Raiders.	Once Were Warriors	I do not know you, stranger, but I ask for your help. I feel shame for this, but I am only one orc. Emotions have surfaced that I have never felt. I... I seek vengeance. Blood for blood. Do your people ever feel this? I wish to pick up my axe and split my enemies in two. To swing the weapon until my arms fall lifelessly at my sides, exhausted. Sunspring Post is directly south of this procession. It is there that you will find our enemies... Kill them... Kill them all... 
Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to drive 20 Kil'sorrow Banners through the bodies of Warmaul ogres at the Laughing Skull Ruins. Return any unused Kil'sorrow Banners.	Returning the Favor	Now you must plant the seed of war in the fat, useless heads of the Warmaul. To the northwest, near the mountains, you will find the Laughing Skull Ruins.<Lantresor points into the crate of armaments you brought him.>Do you recognize those banners? They are Kil'sorrow banners. I want you to take a stack of Kil'sorrow banners and plant them on the corpses of Warmaul ogres. Remember, northwest is where you will find the ogres. 
	Earning Your Wings...	 
Escort Kayra Longmane to the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. Report to Ysiel Windsinger when you've completed this task.	Escape from Umbrafen	You must help me get out of here! I was gathering herbs nearby when a handful of these little savages abducted me. I tried to fight them off, but there were too many of them. Help me return to the Cenarion Refuge and away from these cruel wretches and their vile magic! 
	Mana-Tombs Bonus Objective	 
Follow the trail of golden feathers to find what dropped them.	Birds of a Feather	I have seen many ebon wings in the Maw, but never brilliant golden ones. Now that the aural sequencers are relaying information reliably, we should discover the source of these feathers. Follow the trail, Maw Walker. There is a mystery here... and very likely profit. Gold has value where you come from, does it not? 
Obtain Blacktalon's Claws from Blacktalon the Savage at the Great Fissure and bring it to Ikan at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.	The Rock Flayer Matriarch	Rock flayers are mean, nasty, violent creatures. But the plain ones are like tame beasts when compared to their matriarch, Blacktalon the Savage. My cousin got eaten by her and it wasn't pretty. I swore that one day Blacktalon would pay for that. You bring back proof of that monster's death and I will give you my life's savings. Deal? You're going to need some friends to kill Blacktalon. Big tough friends with sharp swords. You'll find her inside a cave in the Great Fissure. Good luck! 
Samia Inkling has asked you to acquire 5 Wyrmcult Nets and return them to her at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Poaching from Poachers	Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn. I'd like to help. I'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them. I am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere. But first, we're going to need to acquire some nets. I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them. 
Use the Staff of Dreghood Elders on Arzeth the Merciless and slay him after he's lost his powers. Return to Naladu at the Ruins of Sha'naar after completing this task.	Arzeth's Demise	Yes, the elemental spirits have returned to us! We are not as strong as we once were, but a little magic can go a long way in the right hands. Arzeth has great powers bestowed upon him by his dark lord. Take this staff. It was once a great symbol of our tribe. Use it against Arzeth and his powers will be temporarily removed from him. Defeat him then, so that my people may finally be free! 
Baron Sablemane wants you to steal Grulloc's Sack, and then return it to him at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Goodnight, Gronn	I've outdone myself again. I've fashioned a sleeping powder for you to use on Grulloc, the gronn I spoke of who is guarding what I want. Grulloc keeps himself at the Cursed Hollow, an area at the eastern edge of Dragons' End on the other side of the Circle of Blood. If I were you, I wouldn't tarry long once you have his sack. The effects of the dust won't last long. 
Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to bring him 12 Timber Worg Tails. The tails can come from either Timber Worgs or Timber Worg Alphas.	Timber Worg Tails	Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat. They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory. It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help? 
Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 3 Stonescythe Alphas at the Great Fissure, east of Falcon Watch.	The Great Fissure	We're dangerously close to becoming fenced in by Alliance forces. With the influx of sin'dorei pilgrims from Azeroth, we must establish a route that's safe from our enemies' prying eyes. I've given it some thought and have arrived at a solution. We're to establish a secret path through the Great Fissure. Yes, even though the area is crawling with brutal rock flayers, they are merely beasts and can be taught to fear us. I want you to go and kill a good number of them. They shall learn fear. 
Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Prospector Conall at Telredor.	Blacksting's Bane	By Khaz'goroth's flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was Blacksting, although they won't admit it. They were camped just to the south of the glowing draenei towers to the west, just north of the Feralfen Village, when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to Ironforge and show it to them! 
Speak with A'dal in Shattrath City.	The Tempest Key	You have proven yourself capable of great feats, George. Your discovery of the Cipher of Damnation and Kael'Thas' involvement is most important to our cause. Should Kael use the cipher, what little is left of this world may collapse. A'dal is convinced that Kael must be stopped and now seeks adventurers willing to undergo trials. Those that prove their strength will be granted favor by the naaru.<Khadgar nods.>A'dal awaits... 
Take the Mysterious Tome to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post.	Decipher the Tome	This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret Alliance cipher. Althen, the historian in Spinebreaker Post, has studied the Unyielding for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book. 
Kill Void Baron Galaxis and collect his soul shard. Take the shard to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.	From the Abyss	My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the void, a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond. Go south in Void Ridge and use my warp rift generator near the void stones. Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss. A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear. Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard. 
Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. Return to Tally Zapnabber at Toshley's Station.	Test Flight: Razaan's Landing	George, I raised the efficiency of the Zephyrium Capacitorium by 30 percent. That will launch a test subject of your weight and wind drag ratio to new heights! Want to test my theory? This experiment ought to send you near Razaan's Landing. Speak with Rally... he'll get you prepared for launch. 
Kill 20 Bonechewer Orcs and return to Amadi in Honor Hold.	Fel Orc Scavengers	Scavengers, orcs of the Bonechewer clan, skulk about the ruined battlements overlooking the Path of Glory. We must assume that these fel orcs are gathering war machine parts for their masters within Hellfire Citadel -- they must be stopped! Find Bonechewer orcs to the north, George. Find them and slay them! But use caution, for although these orcs are the lesser of the fel orc clans, their strength is the match of any green-skinned orc we've faced thus far... 
Kill Doctor Gutrick and obtain the Doctor's Key. Use the key to open the Doctor's Strongbox to retrieve The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance and deliver the book to Plexi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.	The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance	The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below. There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Gutrick keeps locked in a chest at the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest! 
In order to prove yourself to the Mok'Nathal, Leoroxx has ordered you to slay Gnosh Brognat, leader of the ogres at the Bladespire Outpost. Return to Leoroxx at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains after you have done so, or do not return at all.	Since Time Forgotten...	Since time forgotten we have fought with the Bladespire ogres. We have managed to push them back so that now they only hold a tenuous grip at Bladespire Outpost. It's back the way that you came, on the southwestern edge of the Razor Ridge. Prove your worth to me by killing their leader, Gnosh Brognat. Let us see what stuff you are made of when fighting the ogres. 
Chu'a'lor has asked you to speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened atop one of the towers just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Trouble Below	We commend your zeal in wanting to help out here in Ogri'la, Mechanic. However, we have a favor to ask of you before we can accept your assistance. Down below our brethren are enslaved to the Sons of Gruul. Please, speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened, who is leading an ogre resistance against their gronn masters. Seek him out atop the tower on the eastern side of the Circle of Blood arena. 
Report to Nakansi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.	Invasion Point: Cataclysm	Now that we have access to the Legion's base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. Shadowmoon Village won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from the valley. I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to Legion Hold and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Nakansi will meet you at your destination. 
Magistrix Larynna wants you to go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain a Bloodgem Shard from a Sunfury Magister. Use this shard near the larger Bloodgem crystals and return to her at Area 52. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Bloodgem Crystals	Kael's magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds. They do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones. Go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a Sunfury magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals. Return to me so that I may study the effects of the aura. Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary. 
Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you kill 2 Felguard Legionnaires, 3 Mo'arg Engineers and 8 Gan'arg Tinkerers.	Buying Time	As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the forge camps will have any permanence. We must find a way to destroy the Legion structures. I need time to devise a plan of attack. If you can keep their engineers and tinkerers busy, it would greatly slow down their progress, buying me the time I need. Stay as far away as possible from the overseers, George. They are extremely dangerous beings. 
Give the Dragonmaw Flare to Commander Arcus at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley.	Commander Arcus	The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared. I want you to let them come, George.<Ceyla nods.>Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Arcus. He is standing guard right outside this building. 
Collect 5 Shaleskin Shale and give them to Boots at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Securing the Shaleskin Shale	I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here. But I want something more! The rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground. We can solve that little problem for him. For starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local shaleskin flayers! It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind. Find the flayers, and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks. 
Speak with Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar in Nagrand on Outland.	Hero's Call: Nagrand!	The King has requested you represent him with the Kurenai settlement of Telaar in Nagrand. Seek out Warden Moi'bff Jill upon arrival. 
Audi the Needle at the Stormspire wants you to bring her 10 Dome Generator Segments.	Retrieving the Goods	<Audi looks around and then lowers her voice.>I'm sure Shauly told you a bit about our work here. When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield. It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces? 
Speak to Veronia when you're ready to depart to Manaforge Coruu. Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Behind Enemy Lines	All arrangements have been made to take you to where our spies are hiding. Just come see me when you're ready and we'll get you on your way. 
	Single Firewing Signet	 
Rescue Manni, Moh and Jakk from the Fel Orc camps and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.	How to Serve Goblins	Why would fel orcs steal my shredder parts? I hate them so much. They just sneak into my camp here and take things all the time. A couple of days ago they stole three of my peons! Now the rest of my peons have run off because they are afraid they are going to be eaten by fel orcs. I can't run a mine without peons. If you could save the peons that I lost maybe the others would come back. The fel orcs have their camps along the wall to the southwest. 
Deliver the Meeting Note to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Did You Get The Note?	The cultist dropped this note, which apparently was to be delivered to Overseer Nuaar. It is signed by someone named Kolphis Darkscale. It is likely that Tree Warden Chawn will be interested in looking at this. 
Slay Chancellor Bloodleaf and Corok the Mighty and recover Illidan's Command. Use the Kor'kron Flare Gun to signal another Kor'kron Wind Rider once you have accomplished this task. Speak with Overlord Or'barokh at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley should you lose your Kor'kron Flare Gun and require a replacement.	When Worlds Collide...	At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. You've probably already noticed the smaller giants on the path as well. Something is just not right about all of this, grunt. I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun. 
Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village wants you to capture 10 Energy Isolation Cubes from the blood elf operations at Manaforge Coruu.	Potential Energy Source	We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why. Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy. Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself. 
Deliver the B'naar Console Transcription to Anchorite Karja at Area 52 in Netherstorm. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	B'naar Console Transcription	You try to transcribe the shapes as you see them flash across your eyes. The results are less than exact, but should serve as adequate evidence to prove or disprove the Aldor's suspicions. 
Gather 4 pieces of Raw Farahlite and return to Zuben Elgenubi at the Stormspire.	In Search of Farahlite	To the northeast is an area called the Netherstone, a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity. The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite. 
Retrieve the Annals of Kirin'Var from the town hall of Kirin'Var Village and return it to Custodian Dieworth.	The Annals of Kirin'Var	Silencing the spirits has not bled them of their aggression as we had hoped it would. The malevolent spirits you subdued have reemerged in the streets of the town. We must uncover what is causing this to happen. The destruction of Kirin'Var was just the beginning, or else the spirits would have been quieted by now. The town hall in the southern section of Kirin'Var maintained a logbook of all the residents. Last I heard, it was in the keeping of Battle-Mage Dathric. Perhaps his spirit still has it. 
	The Botanica Reward Quest	 
Bring a Dead Mire Soil Sample to Vindicator Idaar at Telredor.	The Dead Mire	I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, George, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast. Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery. 
Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold.	Fel Orc Plans	The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Bertelm might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to the Allerian Stronghold and show him the map. 
Scout Vanura at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 4 Stonescythe Alpha.	Deadly Predators	The Broken that live in Outland have endured endless violence. It is of little surprise that as soon as the Dark Portal opened they flocked to it in droves with hopes of escaping this land. Unfortunately for our confused brothers and sisters coming from the south, the rock flayers that inhabit the Great Fissure see them as easy prey. Go there and thin the rock flayer population, so that our kin might have a chance. 
	More Sunfury Signets	 
Tradesman Portanuus has asked you to speak with Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.	Report to Nasuun	I am most glad that you are here, Mechanic! Now that we have taken this sanctum, we must hurry to create a magical portal that will lead to here from Shattrath City in the Outland. My liege lord, Exarch Nasuun, is heading up the Offensive's efforts to do just that. He asked me to send along any promising candidates who have what it takes to help with the portal's creation. Please, travel to Shattrath City and speak with him inside A'dal's chamber on the Terrace of Light. 
Bring 12 Cursed Talismans to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point.	Cursed Talismans	George, we cannot allow the Bleeding Hollow orcs to possess their cursed talismans! You must acquire them for us so they may be disposed of, and so the soldiers who owned them may be honored for their sacrifices. Go to Zeth'Gor, the cursed abode of the Bleeding Hollow, and perform your grim task... return to me when you have collected the talismans. 
Use a Fel Reaver Control Console to take control of a Fel Reaver Sentinel. Destroy 60 Deathforged Infernals before your fel reaver fails. When your mission is complete, report to Plexi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.	The Fel and the Furious	<Plexi leafs through the manual.>Well, this has everything we need, but there's just one problem. Fel Reavers aren't really built to respond to remote control. We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the Legion's lackeys, either. Keep an eye out, and whatever you do, don't forget to destroy as much as you can! 
The Mistress of the Mines at the Netherwing Mines in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 15 Nethermine Cargo crates.	Picking Up The Pieces...	Much of our hard work lies scattered about in these mines. Carts full of cargo are littered across every inch of this mine! We just can't get to any of it with the current infestation. That's where you come in, George. Your daily duty here at this mine is to collect the cargo left behind by the miners and deep mine workers. Gather the nethermine cargo and return it to me or my sister. 
Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds in Nagrand has asked that you Visit Sunspring Post, Visit Laughing Skull Ruins, Visit Garadar and Visit Bleeding Hollow Ruins.	A Visit With The Ancestors	I need for you to journey to the villages of the ancestors, George. Seek each one out and see if the ancestors remain. Visit Sunspring Post to the north, visit the Laughing Skull Ruins far to the north against the mountains, visit Garadar to the northeast, and finally, visit the Bleeding Hollow Ruins on the borders of Nagrand and the Terokkar Forest, to the east. Return to me once you have observed the ancestors in their homes. 
Honor Guard Wesilow wants you to defeat 12 Unyielding Footmen, 10 Unyielding Sorcerers, and 5 Unyielding Knights at the Expedition Armory to the south.	Unyielding Souls	Near the end of our invasion, the Armory to the south fell under attack by the Horde's insidious Death Knights. Those vile shades cursed the Armory's defenders - and trapped their souls between the realms of the living and the dead. Those noble souls must be set free! I beg you, George, end my comrades' torment, for I have not the heart to slay them myself. 
Take the Crimson Crystal Shard to Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	The Earthbinder	You should take the crystal lump over to the earthbinder. She's just like you... always needing to get to the bottom of a mystery and thinking all of the time. If you ask me, she thinks a little too much. Just give it to her and I'm sure that she'll get you into a heap of trouble figuring out what is going on up there on the ridge. 
Kill 4 Felsworn Scalewing, 4 Felsworn Daggermaw, and 2 Fel Corrupters.	Culling the Wild	The number of atrocities committed by the Burning Legion is countless. Even as we speak, they send their legion forces against the creatures of this land. Helpless to defend against their power, they fall one by one. George, help me stop these crimes of nature destroy all which they corrupt. Over the hill, east of here, you will see the corruption spreading across Bladed Gulch. Kill the ones causing the crime, the Fel Corrupters, and as many Felsworn as you can. 
Gather 15 Nether Dragonkin Eggs, then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.	A Promising Start	We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though. We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help? 
Mother Kashur has asked that you put to rest 15 Agitated Orc Spirits.	The Agitated Ancestors	Do you see them walking around us? The Ancestral Grounds are normally quiet and undisturbed. As of late, the ancestral spirits have risen and are extremely agitated. Something is causing a great disturbance to the spirits. We must discover what that something could be, but first, we must put the immediate threat to rest. These ghosts that you see walking about are not truly the ancestors but a representation of their state of being. You must destroy the agitated orc spirits. Do this and return to me. 
	Old Hillsbrad Foothills Reward Quest	 
Kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers and return to Theloria Shadecloak.	Thinning the Ranks	Knowing Thander and Bertelm, they won't tolerate such a large buildup of hostile forces on our doorstep. Asking them to dispatch members of the garrison to participate in an attack on the camp isn't an option either. It would just leave us too vulnerable to attack. It falls to us to do what we can to diminish the threat the fel orc buildup poses. Kill what you can of their forces and I will look for ways to stall any reinforcements. 
Obtain 8 Orders from Kael'thas from demons at Manaforge Ara and bring them to Spymaster Thalodien in Area 52. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	Damning Evidence	As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara. Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion. He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly. If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage. I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal. Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien. 
Travel to Shattrath City to tell A'dal about Akama's request.	The Hostage Soul	You might wonder why I go to such lengths to hide my intentions. Why not throw my lot in openly with the naaru? My very essence - my soul - is held prisoner inside the Black Temple. Illidan could destroy me any moment... until now! This phylactery will allow me to regain control of my soul. The time has come, George. I'll lead Maiev and my Deathsworn to Illidan's doorstep. Speak to A'dal and and tell him of our plan. If we strike together we'll break through Illidan's defenses. 
Find Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley.	Grom'tor, Son of Oronok	My first born, Grom'tor, left to search Coilskar Point - directly southwest of here. He's the warrior in the family - ill-tempered and blood-thirsty... Traits he inherited from his mother. Search along the outskirts of Coilskar Point. If you see naga corpses, Grom'tor is sure to be close. When you find him, tell him this: ""We spill blood for just cause."" It will let him know that you are a friend to Torn-heart and prevent your premature death. 
Slaughter 5 Boulder'mok Brutes and 3 Boulder'mok Shaman, and then return to Lieutenant Fairweather at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Slaughter at Boulder'mok	I know that we have plans for you to head to Boulder'mok. I have something that I want you to do while you are there. We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing! Boulder'mok lies to the west. Travel southwest, cross the bridge and head through the tunnel. On the west side of the Raven's Wood you will find them. George, I want you to wipe out the Bladespire ogres of Boulder'mok. 
Bring the Primed Key Mold to Dumphry in Honor Hold.	Grand Master Dumphry	The symbol on the key's handle... it is hard to make it out inside the mold, but I recognize it at the Shattered Hand's own. There is a good chance this key will allow you to enter the Shattered Halls. Speak to Dumphry. He is a master of his craft. If he can't craft this key for you, no one can. 
Mog'dorg the Wizened has asked you to speak with Chu'a'lor at Ogri'la in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Ogre Heaven	Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans. This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome. But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west. You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight. When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed. 
Report to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.	The Consortium Needs You!	My organization, the Consortium, is looking for a few resourceful individuals just like yourself. You'll be hard pressed to find ethereals more honest, hard-working or pleasant to be around than us. All we require is loyalty, dedication and a reasonable amount of moral flexibility. If you're interested, speak to Gezhe, our ground operations leader. You will find him at Aeris Landing, north of Oshu'gun. 
Speak with Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.	Kroghan's Report	My original orders were to remain in Garadar for a short time, then continue on and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison. I know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival. 
Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to bring him 4 Sporebat Eyes and 4 Fen Strider Tentacles.	Gathering the Reagents	I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered. You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor. 
Bring 10 Condensed Voidwalker Essences to ""Screaming"" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.	Voidwalkers Gone Wild	Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here! To the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries. If you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too! 
Lord Torvos in Shattrath wants you to capture the Sunfury Attack Plans.	Sunfury Attack Plans	As we press the offensive on Quel'Danas, we've discovered that Kael'thas' minions are planning a counterattack. By ordering the Sunfury blood elves, based in Netherstorm, to attack our operations in Outland, he hopes to draw troops and attention away from the Sunwell. We must not allow this to happen, George. Each and every blade is needed on the front lines. Go to Netherstorm and capture their attack plans. Any of the Sunfury blood elves up there could be in possession of the plans. Good luck, George. 
Locate and deal with Boglash, then return to Lethyn Moonfire at Cenarion Refuge.	The Dying Balance	Have you observed your surroundings closely, George? This is an ailing landscape, struggling to keep itself in balance and losing the fight. If you know where to look, you can see the symptoms. Members of some species rapidly outgrow their peers and become more aggressive. A good example of this uncontrolled growth is the marshtrekker Boglash. If you wish to see it for yourself, look no further than the waterways south of the refuge. Be prepared to defend yourself. The creature knows no mercy. 
Bring 8 Nether Residue to Emissary Mordin in Shattrath City.	Gaining the Advantage	The troops of the Shattered Sun Offensive will need every advantage they can get to beat back the allies of Kil'Jaeden. My colleagues in Stormwind have created oils which will strengthen the blades and armor of our troops. The key ingredient, nether residue, pervades Outland -- if you know where to look. Any master herbalist, skinner, or miner who knows the signs can gather it while plying <his/her> trade. Those herbs, ores, and beasts native to Outland may all bear the residue. 
Find Ar'tor, Son of Oronok at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.	Ar'tor, Son of Oronok	My youngest son, Ar'tor, left to search Illidari Point - far to the southwest, nestled between Legion Hold and Wildhammer Stronghold. While Ar'tor is a hunter of remarkable skill and an expert tracker, I fear that he may be in over his head this time. Illidari Point is the proving grounds for Illidan's demons. These are demons that left the Burning Legion to join the Betrayer! Travel to Illidari Point and find Ar'tor, George. 
Return to Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch.	The Mistress Revealed	I'm Arelion's friend, but I'm not going to take the beating of my life for him. His mistress is Viera Sunwhisper. Go tell that harpy of a wife of his. What's she going to do anyway? 
Bring Warlord Morkh's Shattered Armor to Corporal Ironridge in Expedition Point.	Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow	You have shown great strength and fortune, for you have delved into Zeth'Gor and lived! Now, let us hope your fortune holds, for I have a dire task to ask of you...Warlord Morkh sits within the barracks of Zeth'Gor, commanding his fel troops against us. His tactics are as clever as they are cruel, and I must admit that his successes against us have cut deep. And so, George, I ask you to remove Morkh from his seat. Bring me his armor so that we might display it for our soldiers and bolster them. 
Collect 5 Bladespire Totems for Spiritcaller Dohgar at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Totems of My Enemy	There is the right way to honor one's ancestors, and there is the wrong way. The Bladespire ogres carry totems with them, but they do not use them to show their respect. Instead, they seek to use them to manipulate and control. We should steal their totems because they are unworthy! We will then put them to better use. Go to the Bladespire Outpost to the west, just southwest of the Razor Ridge. Slay the Bladespire mystics and crushers, and take their totems from them! 
Elkay'gan the Mystic at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to recover 20 Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates.	Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates	The Boulderfist have moved the supplies they stole from our village to the twin clefts of Nagrand, found west of here in the Halaani Basin. While you are in the area, keep your eye out for the supply crates. If we can get those back, it would ease much of the burden that has fallen upon the matrons of Garadar. 
Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Stand Tall, Captain!	Well, well, well... still alive I see. That's good, because Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his tower at once. Get a move on! 
Speak with Wind Trader Lathrai near the World's End Tavern in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.	Wind Trader Lathrai	I was asked to pick up and deliver some boxes of goods from an ethereal in Shattrath City. Last I saw him, he was standing outside of the World's End Tavern in Lower City. His name is Wind Trader Lathrai, and that's all that I know! Want more answers, go talk with him! 
Bring Blacktalon's Claws to Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.	WANTED: Blacktalon the Savage	By order of the Ranger Captain, a reward is hereby offered for the slaying of the vicious rockflayer matriarch known as Blacktalon the Savage. Blacktalon was last sighted inside a cave in the Great Fissure. Individuals seeking the reward are to present the creature's claws as proof of the deed. 
Speak to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.	Warchief's Command: Zangarmarsh!	The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost. Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh. Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there. 
Look for Gremni Longbeard northwest of the Den of Haal'esh, to the far west of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.	The Longbeards	We were having a problem with arakkoa bandits raiding many of our supply caravans, so I hired some dwarves to take care of them. They were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest. I'm a little worried about them. Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition! Maybe you can go check up on them? The arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the Great Fissure. They set up camp northwest of there, south of Dustquill Ravine. 
Deliver Timothy's Letter to Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	No Time for Curiosity	George, I have a favor to ask of you. Normally, I would do this myself, but my hands are already beyond full. I have an associate named Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains to the north. He's expecting to hear from me in the near future, although I suspect he won't like what I have to say. If you would deliver my response to him, you would have my gratitude. I must insist, and this is very important, that you not attempt to read the letter. It is for Kialon's eyes alone. 
Kill 12 Gan'arg Sappers and return to Foreman Biggums.	When This Mine's a-Rockin'	The mine's been overrun by a plague of gan'arg misfits! Not only did they run all my workers out of the tunnels, but they're pounding away in there night and day! To make things worse, now I've got Danath on me back! He says he's going to take away me ale ration if I don't get this taken care of soon! None of the miners'll go in there, and the guards are busy drinking themselves silly. I'm begging you, George, help me here. Danath can take me dignity, but he'll never take me ale! 
Speak with Wing Commander Gryphongar in Shatter Point.	Wing Commander Gryphongar	Wing Commander Gryphongar runs this outfit of Wildhammers. If this is your first time to Shatter Point, then you should report to him. You'll find him inside what's left of that tower over yonder. 
Take a gryphon to Honor Point and speak with Field Marshal Brock.	Go to the Front	Well, George, I hope you're prepared for the next phase of our operation. The Legion never rests - and neither shall we! Take a gryphon and fly over to Honor Point - it's a small post near the Legion Front. Speak with Field Marshal Brock. He'll have instructions for you when you arrive. Oh, and tell that pasty-faced shield-kisser I said 'hello'. 
Vertok Axebreaker in Thrallmar wants you to bring Bonechewer Blood Samples to Apothecary Zelana at Reaver's Fall.	Apothecary Zelana	Apethecary Zelana has been studying the beasts of Hellfire Peninsula in the field. She wants a sample of the blood you gathered; with luck, she might discover what turned those Bonechewer bastards' skins red! Zelana is at Reaver's Fall, southeast of Thrallmar. Follow the road east and when you see a destroyed, green-glowing hunk of metal, you're there. She has a camp set up behind the wyverns. 
Slay Uvuros and recover Uvuros's Fiery Mane. Return it to Warcaller Sardon Truslice at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley.	WANTED: Uvuros, Scourge of Shadowmoon	Wanted - DEAD:Uvuros, scourge of Shadowmoon Valley. By order of Overlord Or'barokh, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed. Return the fiery mane of the beast to Warcaller Sardon Truslice should you succeed. Uvuros was last seen at the Hand of Gul'dan, located in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - east of Shadowmoon Village. 
Varen the Reclaimer wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweavers. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	The Great Retribution	You did well against the Ashtongue Broken, George. I have another challenge for you, should you be up to it. Not too long ago, the Sanctum of the Stars suffered a tremendous attack by Illidan's fel orcs. We've determined it was perpetrated by the Shadowmoon orcs who occupy the Ata'mal Terrace. Show them that the Scryers are not to be trifled with. 
	More Heads Full of Ivory	 
Deliver the bad news to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.	Warn Area 52!	George, you have to get word back to Area 52 immediately! Hurry! Tell the rocket-chief that the Burning Legion is after us now! 
Go inside Manaforge B'naar and find the B'naar Control Console. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.	Naaru Technology	The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets. They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster. It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep. Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel. Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can. We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology. 
Speak with Wind Trader Marid and lure him away from his trading post. Deal with him and then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.	Troublesome Distractions	Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down. We've been able evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe. If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him. 
Retrieve the Smithing Hammer from the Kirin'Var Apprentices and bring it back to Apprentice Andrethan in Kirin'Var Village.	Indispensable Tools	You haven't seen a heavy smithing hammer lying around by chance, have you? I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it. I've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the smithy? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square. 
Bring Boss Grog'ak's Head to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.	WANTED: Boss Grog'ak	Wanted - Dead or Alive: Boss Grog'ak, overseer of the Ango'rosh mushroom-cutting operation. This brute and his axe-wielding cronies are responsible for chopping down the mushrooms to the north of town. Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin.<He/She> who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded. 
Lieutenant Gravelhammer asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to him in Allerian Stronghold.	Thin the Flock	The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could marshal our soldiers. Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northwest. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can. They may not fear us, but at least we can thin their numbers. 
Help Akuno find his way to the Refugee Caravan in Terokkar Forest. Speak to Mekeda after you've completed this quest.	Escaping the Tomb	I appreciate your help, George. I was certain I was going to be killed. Let's get out of here with a hurry. It won't be long before more cultists come after us. 
Retrieve T'chali's Hookah and 10 Bloodmaul Brutebane Brews. Bring them back to T'chali the Witch Doctor at Bloodmaul Ravine in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!	T'chali used to be a pretty friendly troll. Me come down here to teach the Bloodmaul how to brew their beer. But once me do that, the Bloodmaul bury T'chali and leave him here to rot! The worst part of it was that they stole me hookah! So, you want to help T'chali? You bring me hookah back. T'chali think the ogres that stole it headed southwest over by the mine. And while you're in there, pick up some brews, too! 
Kill Rema and then inform Commander Skyshadow at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	The Den Mother	WANTED! Rema, the den mother and primary defender of the Jagged Ridge south of Thunderlord Stronghold. Find her by heading east out of town and across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine. She keeps herself secluded in the tunnel at the southern edge of the ridge. Return with news of her demise to Commander Skyshadow of Sylvanaar. 
Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. While flying to Ruuan Weald, spin the Nether-weather Vane. Deliver the Spinning Nether-weather Vane to O'Mally Zapnabber in Ruuan Weald.	Test Flight: Ruuan Weald	Hey, George. I'm glad I caught you! I have a very important mission! Here is a nether-weather vane. I need you to take some in flight readings for me and deliver them to my cousin in Ruuan Weald. Speak with Rally and take a Zephyrium Capacitorium flight to Ruuan Weald. While you're flying, spin the vane! After you land, bring the spinning vane to O'Mally Zabnabber. Good luck, George. And don't delay! 
Speak with Nahuud at Telaar in Nagrand.	A Message to Telaar	You've been honorable in our dealings, George, at a time when trust is hard to win among my people. A large group of my brethren have made their home in the old draenei city of Telaar in Nagrand, to the south. To reach Telaar, take the road south into Nagrand, then continue southeast until you find yourself in the cliffs east of Oshu'gun. Anyone who has aided us, as you have, would be welcome among the people of Telaar. Seek out Nahuud and tell him you have earned my trust. 
Travel to Manaforge Coruu, east of Area 52, and obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from Overseer Seylanna. Use it at the Manaforge Coruu Console to shut it down and return to Anchorite Karja. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu	Your success at B'naar has given us a great deal of hope, George. We've shared our discoveries with the Scryers and in return they've given us more information on the remaining manaforges. Three other manaforges still stand, in full control of the Sunfury army. You will find Manaforge Coruu to the east. Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal there. Obtain it and use it on the manaforge's control console to begin the emergency shutdown. We're all counting on you, George. 
Take Vindicator Idaar's Letter to Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.	The Fate of Tuurem	Prophet Velen's search for allies has emboldened those draenei remaining in Outland to begin a search of their own. The Legion's war on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization. Tuurem, my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the orcs. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out. 
Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.	A Strange Vision	I've had a most unusual vision, George, and I don't know quite what to make of it. I've seen an arrow, an immense arrow, riding into the sky on a trail of fire. Such a feat is trivial for a skilled mage, but somehow I know the arrow I saw is not the product of magic. It will be unlike anything the people of Azeroth have ever achieved. You must seek out the people working on this, George. Lend them your help, for without it, their efforts may yet fail. 
	More Firewing Signets	 
Farseer Margadesh at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to bring him the Head of Ortor of Murkblood.	Murkblood Leaders...	We have lost many friends in recent weeks. For decades we have dealt with the ogres of Nagrand but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town. While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him. 
Speak with Rina Moonspring at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Hero's Call: Blade's Edge Mountains!	The Alliance forces of Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains require reinforcements. The King has asked for any able bodied members of the Alliance to journey to the mountains along the northern border of Zangarmarsh. 
Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to Manaforge B'naar and slay 2 Sunfury Warp-Masters, 6 Sunfury Warp-Engineers and 8 Sunfury Geologists. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	High Value Targets	Based on the roster information, we know that the brains of the manaforge operations are the warp-masters and warp-engineers. It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called ""warp-energy"" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes. The only other specialists in the area are geologists. Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced. Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most. 
Zurai at Swamprat Post wants you to bring him 12 Thick Hydra Scales.	Thick Hydra Scales	Reavij was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long. I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home. Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes. 
	The Blood Furnace Reward Quest	 
Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of Area 52, and speak to Kaylaan. Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	Outside Assistance	The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges. Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara. I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area. Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan. See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara. Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them. 
	More Fertile Spores	 
Slay 4 Illidari Taskmasters at the Ruins of Sha'naar and return to Ikan at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.	Cruel Taskmasters	You probably think most Broken are evil, don't you? In reality many just lack guidance. Before I met the Omenai, I too was lost. Our minds suffered terrible pain from the orcs' demonic magic. We are easily confused and taken advantage of. Demons allied with Illidan raid Hellfire daily and capture our kind as slaves. With the Omenai we now have hope. Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar, southwest of here, and slay the Illidari taskmasters so my people may be free! 
Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.	I Work... For the Horde!	Would you believe it? These orcs hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build explosives. What a dream job! It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever goblin like myself learns how to make do! Can you help me? I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory. Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those red-skinned orcs! When you're done, come back for big rewards! 
Speak with Baron Sablemane about fashioning a trap. He is located at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Pay the Baron a Visit	This is bad news. Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater is behind the recent Bloodmaul plans against Sylvanaar! Why he's manipulating them, and not just using the Bladespire, I don't know. But if we're to deal with a gronn, we're going to need help. I know a man who is wise in the ways of all sorts of exotic magics. Baron Sablemane is his name, and you can find him at the Circle of Blood, back down the ramp to the northwest, and then southwest through the canyon. Ask him to fashion us a trap for the gronn. 
Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Felspine's Hide.	The Main Course!	Long story short, I used to work with a blood elf named Tiorus. My partnership with Tiorus dissolved once I got into gourmet living. He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his Horde goons using my arcano-scorp probes at the Ruins of Baa'ri lava flow and discovered the mother of all diemetradons! I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, Felspine, and bring his hide back to me. Hurry up! 
Search Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard for clues about who is behind the manipulation of the spirits.	Searching for Evidence	Whoever is behind the transformation of the spirits has been very deliberate in their actions, taking care to target the most powerful mages first, but why? The kind of magic required to influence the spirits of slain Kirin Tor mages must be very powerful. Why would a powerful mage go to all this trouble? I'm inclined to say this is another plot of Kael'thas's, designed to cause more misery here. If there are blood elves here, they're likely to be hiding in the houses across the covered bridge. 
Bring the Repair Apparatus to Tashar at Eco-Dome Farfield.	Testing the Prototype	I've been working on a portable generator repair kit for use in some of the harsher climates that the Consortium operates in. Granted, it wasn't designed for Netherstorm, but we shouldn't have any problems with it. I had already scheduled a test with one of my best techs up at Eco-Dome Farfield beyond the Netherstone to the northeast. Take this prototype to Tashar. He'll know what to do with it. If it works, we can use it to reinforce the shield generators at the larger domes. 
Anchorite Obadei wants you to look for his brother, Sedai, nearby to the east in Hellfire Peninsula.	In Search of Sedai	Hear my plight, Mechanic. My brother, Sedai, left long ago to contact the orcs of Mag'har Post. Ever the idealist, he thought the time was ripe to set our differences aside and negotiate a peace with them. He's been missing for days and I fear for the worst. Would you set my mind to rest and look for him? Sedai must be somewhere nearby to the east. 
Locate Parshah in the Magma Fields and speak to him.	Find the Deserter	There's nothing here that would explain why the spirits of these arakkoa have remained in this world or how they came into thirst for the blood of orcs. I think our best lead is to try to find the deserter mentioned in the journal. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning. Start your search for him on the road through the Magma Fields to the southeast. 
Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to speak to Mo'mor the Breaker.	Mo'mor the Breaker	You must seek out Mo'mor immediately! You will find him in the center of Telaar, by the fountain. Tell him exactly what the ogre told you. 
Defeat 10 enemy players in Halaa and return to Karrtog in Garadar.	Enemies, Old and New	Our ancient enemy, the draenei, have returned with powerful allies. They wage war in Halaa, southwest of here. We cannot allow them a victory there as Garadar would be next without a doubt. Go and slay those who would aid our ancient enemy. 
Kaylaan at Tuluman's Landing in Netherstorm wants you to slay 6 Gan'arg Warp-Tinkers, 3 Daughters of Destiny and 3 Mo'arg Warp-Masters. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	A Dark Pact	We've been so blind, George, that the alliance of two of our most dangerous enemies went completely unnoticed. I wouldn't be surprised if the Scryers had something to do with hiding this information from us, but we must now face the reality. The Burning Legion and Kael'thas' Sunfury army serve under the same banner. These demons are the only reason Kael'thas was ever able to utilize the technology in Tempest Keep. Under Orelis's orders I must command you to destroy them. 
Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire wants you to bring her a Hulking Hydra Heart.	When Nature Goes Too Far	The dome technology possesses such power! Certainly, there are bounds beyond which we dare not go, George. Creatures allowed to grow too large or too fast could be just as bad as a barren landscape. I have heard rumors of just such a creature in the pool to the east. I've heard the ethereal merchants conspiring to catch the overgrown hydra for sport, but I have another purpose in mind for the giant. Bring me the creature's heart so I may study it. 
Shadowstalker Kaide wants you to kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers.	What Happens in Terokkar Stays in Terokkar	If word reaches Thrallmar that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it? If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now. Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs. 
Gather 12 Hellfire Spineleaf plants for a salve and return to Grelag at Spinebreaker Post.	Preparing the Salve	Just as Zeth'Gor came into view, a Legion patrol caught sight of me. I ran, hoping to duck into one of the towers in the distance, but one of their felhounds caught up with me and nearly hamstrung me! I managed to escape, but my leg is in terrible shape. Stone Guard Ambelan found me and brought me here. Now, I have to find a way to tend to my leg. Spineleaf grows in and around the Valley of Bones to the north . A salve made from it will dull the pain enough for me to travel. 
	More Glowcaps	 
Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan in Terokkar Forest wants you to kill 8 Cabal Skirmishers, 4 Cabal Spell-Weavers and 2 Cabal Initiates.	Before Darkness Falls	After our caravan fell prey to an attack by Shadow Council cabal cultists, scouts were sent to Shattrath to call for help. The guards think we're safe for now, but they underestimate these madmen. I, for one, am not looking forward to having my throat slit by some cabal initiate in the middle of the night. Do us all a favor and take the fight to them, before they come to us. You will find our attackers south of here, at Auchindoun's northern entrance. 
Collect 18 Plucked Lashh'an Feathers, then read the Lashh'an Tome in the treetops of Veil Lashh.	Malaise	The magic practiced by the Lashh'an arakkoa is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents! That doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me. You could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh. And unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those. 
Tor'chunk Twoclaws has asked you to slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks. Afterward, return to him at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Crush the Bloodmaul Camp	<Tor'chunk leans in close to whisper.>George, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far. And while I have every confidence in what Rexxar has planned, I would still ask that you crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp before returning. That way we'll be doubly certain of the outcome. To get there, head north down the ramp out of Thunderlord. Then, at the base of the ramp, head west across Dragons' End and north through the Churning Gulch and Daggermaw Canyon. 
Baron Sablemane has tasked you and your friends with the deaths of 10 Bladespire Enforcers, 5 Bladespire Battlemages, 5 Bladespire Ravagers and their leader, Fingrom. When you have managed this feat, return to him at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Massacre at Gruul's Lair	You've proven yourself resourceful, and now I think I'm going to put you to personal use in my own fight against Gruul and his sons. The Bladespire clan are the favored of the gronn, and while you may have thinned out their numbers elsewhere, you haven't yet dealt with their strongest. Gruul protects the exterior of his lair with only the toughest of ogres, and it is those that you must kill. Head north through the Daggermaw Canyon and you will find Gruul's Lair at the end. 
Bring 4 Fel Iron Bars, 2 Arcane Dust and 4 Motes of Fire to Dumphry at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.	Dumphry's Request	Fel orcs might be complete barbarians but their smithing is not as primitive as you might think. Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it. Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire. I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises. 
Speak to Veronia outside Area 52 and fly to Manaforge Coruu. Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.	Stealth Flight	While you were gone, my men uncovered another one of these manaforges. It is east of here and is known as Manaforge Coruu. Two of my best spies have arranged a secret landing spot outside of the manaforge. You are to help them infiltrate Kael's forces and obtain whatever information you can. Speak to Veronia just outside the city walls; she's arranged for a windrider that will take you to Manaforge Coruu. Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn; he will brief you on your mission. 
Locate and slay Lisaile Fireweaver, then return to Theloria Shadecloak.	The Firewing Liaison	Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying? My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost. Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again. 
Report to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.	Warchief's Command: Netherstorm!	The goblins of Area 52 in Netherstorm have called for assistance from any able bodied champions willing to provide them the support they need in their endevours. The Warchief feels their position and aid in the region will provide a tactical advantage against the nearby forces of Kael'thas. Area 52 can be reached by following the northeastern road of Blade's Edge Mountains until you see the world crumbling away into the Twisting Nether. 
Tooki wants you to report to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest.	Report to Stonebreaker Camp	This calls for immediate action! We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with. She'll have a better idea of what our next step should be. Report to Sergeant Chawni out at Stonebreaker Camp and apprise her of the situation. Take the road north out of the hold. From the middle of Tuurem, follow the road to the east. You'll find the camp on the bank of the river that lies just southwest of Firewing Point. Good luck, George. 
Bronwyn Stouthammer has asked you to collect 5 Draenethyst Mine Crystals and then return to her at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Into the Draenethyst Mine	Well it's good to see someone who's willing to help out around here! Borgrim and I are part of the Explorers' League, and we're here to learn what we can of these mountains. We've heard all sorts of tales, and I can't wait to get settled in and started. One thing in particular has caught my attention. The night elves speak of a place down in the ravine to the east known as the Draenethyst Mine. It's at the south end of Bloodmaul Outpost. I'd like some of the crystals that grow naturally therein. 
Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome wants you to slay 10 Crystal Flayers and then return to him at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Crystal Clear	The damned rock flayers are keeping me from my research down in the Singing Ridge! By digging at the crystals there, with every scratch they are ruining my chances of studying the harmonics of the singing crystals. You look like someone who can help me deal with this problem. Head south and clear those crystal flayers out. 
Wing Commander Brack at Reaver's Fall in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.	Return to the Abyssal Shelf	George, are you ready for another sortie over the Abyssal Shelf? I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the Legion forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large demon attack from the north. What say you, Mechanic? Do you want to take another windrider and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time? 
Escort Bessy safely back to her owner, Thadell.	When the Cows Come Home	Realizing that Bessy is still staring at you, you gesture toward Thadell's location. You find yourself promising to protect the cow on her way home. Upon finishing your sentence, you realize there's no possible way the cow could understand anything you've said. Shrugging your shoulders, you prepare to guard the bovine on her way back to Thadell. 
Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to bring him 30 Naga Claws.	A Warm Welcome	While the druids from the expedition have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area. Ever since we set foot in Zangarmarsh, the naga have launched lethal attacks against us without warning. We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited. I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed. Bring me their claws as proof of your victories. 
Use the Energy Field Modulator on Farahlon Lashers. Observe the results and report back to Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire when you have conducted 10 tests.	Flora of the Eco-Domes	Just look around you, Mechanic! Isn't it amazing? Of course, this incredible resurgence of life is a byproduct of the ethereal domes, but imagine what it could do in the hands of the expedition. I'm preparing to negotiate with the ethereals for access to their technology, but I'd like to get a better idea of its effects on plant-based life. I've built a device to concentrate the dome's energies on the lashers in this area. Would you be so kind as to test it for me and share the results? 
Take Rilak's Missive to Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes.	Seek Out Kirrik	Other arakkoa took part in the betrayal of Terokk. Kirrik recognized Terokk as a charlatan, not a prophet. The only prophecy Terokk envisioned was the doom borne of his own bidding. It was Kirrik who led us bravely from Skettis. After our pilgrimage to Shattrath, Kirrik traveled to the colonies in search of others. This missive tells of what the Eyes have seen. Kirrik must be told! Follow the road south out of Shattrath to the Bone Wastes and look for the caravan. 
	Single Sunfury Signet	 
Elementalist Ioki wants you to travel to the Throne of the Elements and speak with Elementalist Sharvak.	The Throne of the Elements	Greetings, Human. I am Ioki, elementalist of the Earthen Ring. I have come to Telaar to inform the Kurenai of the state of the elements. Could I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of Nagrand, beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Telaar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed. 
Speak with Dama Wildmane at Shadowmoon Village.	The Apprentice's Request	As an apprentice wind rider master, one of my tasks is to care for the beasts when they're not flying. The problem is that we have so few here, there's very little downtime for any of them. I'm afraid we'll work them all to death if we don't receive any replacements. There's a large stable down in Shadowmoon Village, in western Shadowmoon Valley. Dama Wildmane oversees the wind rider care and training there. Would you speak with her on our behalf and let her know about our situation? 
The Dragonmaw Foreman at the Netherwing Mines in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 15 Nethermine Flayers and 5 Nethermine Ravagers.	Dragons are the Least of Our Problems	That dragon waking up riled up a host of other nasty creatures in these mines. Two types are proving to be a thorn in the side of the Dragonmaw: Nethermine flayers and Nethermine ravagers. You must help us by killing them off. All I ask is your involvement once per day. Get in there and kill as many as you can! 
Mehrdad at Midrealm Post wants you to kill 8 Barbscale Crocolisks.	Deal With the Saboteurs	In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the crocolisks have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem. The Consortium is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them. 
Gather 8 Eel Filets from Umbrafen Eels and bring them to Magasha at Swamprat Post.	No More Mushrooms!	Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce! Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner! Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms! How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks? 
	TBC 60-69	 
Bring the Ango'rosh Attack Plans to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.	Impending Attack	The position of the ogres' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on Zabra'jin. I must know for certain, George. The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the Ango'rosh Grounds. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there, George and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious. 
Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Firewing Signets. Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.	Firewing Signets	It is no secret that Kael'thas Sunstrider perceives us as a great threat. Let's face it - not many sin'dorei, fresh from Silvermoon, are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps. It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words. Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight. The only way to prove you're with us, George, is to do your share of fighting. Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank. Bring them to me. 
Report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.	Falcon Watch	My people recently finished building Falcon Watch, a base of operations in the southwestern region of Hellfire Peninsula - beyond Hellfire Citadel. You are welcome there as an ally, George. If you're looking for work, go there and tell Ranger Captain Venn'ren that I sent you. He will see to it that you're given tasks worthy of someone of your caliber. 
Take a flight to Honor Hold and deliver Duron's Report to Marshal Isildor.	Journey to Honor Hold	When you're ready, I'll arrange a flight straight to Honor Hold. From there, speak with Marshal Isildor and give him Duron's report. He'll be happy to see another recruit from the homelands, and I'm sure the information in that report is important stuff! 
Search out Leoroxx at the Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.	Whispers on the Wind	I have chased rumors of the Mok'Nathal across Outland with nothing to show for it. Finally, we may have found their home. But now that the moment is here, I am filled with unease. Unease that has kept me awake deep into the nights during my search. Will they accept me? I... know their leader's name: Leoroxx. Seek him out. You must be my eyes in this. 
Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill Master Daellis Dawnstrike.	Down With Daellis	I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor. He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, George, and silence his bow for good. 
Follow Wing Commander Ichman while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Wing Commander Ichman, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman	Three years I spent in that hell hole. Three years a prisoner of war to the damnable Frostwolf Clan. Made to sit in their tower and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to Dun Baldar. About how it's ""unfair"" that blah, blah, blah, blah... War isn't fair! To hell with 'em all! The minute I was freed I left that place forever and came here to start a new life. Now Mulv and I are vying for the top orc spot. If you want it, you're gonna have to go through me, scrub. We go when you're ready. 
Place the three Surveying Markers and then return to Zephyrion at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.	Surveying the Ruins	I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations! The problem is that the place has been infested by demons! Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me? There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers. Each is near a draenei banner. Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers. 
Slay Rajah Haghazed at the Lagoon and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Expedition in Zangarmarsh for a reward.	Leader of the Darkcrest	A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the Darkcrest naga. Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion scouts at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of Zangarmarsh. The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot. 
Kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and Razorsaw at Forge Camp Mageddon and return to Forward Commander Brock at Honor Point.	Disruption - Forge Camp: Mageddon	Pay close attention, George. We've been surveying the Legion camps that lie along the ridge ahead. We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted Fel Reavers. You can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt! 
Leoroxx has challenged you to slay Dreadwing. Return to him at Mok'Nathal Village once you have managed to kill her.	Slay the Brood Mother	My hunters have just returned from a scouting mission to the Singing Ridge. It seems that the nether drakes, which infest the crystals there, have increased greatly in number, and threaten to spill out into our laps. Since you have proven yourself a competent slayer, let us see if your Mechanic skills are the match of an adult drake. Find the Singing Ridge by heading south through the Scalewing Shelf. Enter and slay their brood mother, Dreadwing. 
Follow Corlok the Vet while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Corlok the Vet, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: Corlok the Vet	You are challenging ME? Don't make me laugh! You're serious? Very well then! All you need to do is not die. You can manage to not die, right?? Even if I'm hurling skulls at you and flying circles around your pathetic riding skills? Just let me know when you're ready and we'll lift off. 
Seek out the Mistress of the Mines on Netherwing Ledge.	The Netherwing Mines	Your help is required at the Netherwing Mines, overseer George. Two days ago our mining operations came to a grinding halt when we made a grim discovery. A miner was working in the depths of the mine and struck his pick upon an unusual crystal formation. Unfortunately, this crystal formation was attached to a very angry nether dragon. The beast woke from its slumber and annihilated all of our workers. Report to the Mistress of the Mines. They await you at the mouth of the mines, southwest of here. 
Give the Dragonmaw Flare to Commander Hobb at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.	Commander Hobb	The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared. I want you to let them come, George.<Thelis nods.>Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Hobb. He is standing guard right outside this building. 
	Zoya the Veridian Netherwing Drake	 
Bring 8 Fenclaw Hides to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage.	Natural Armor	Maktu can always see a draenei approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp! Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the Kurenai and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor. The dark, scaly hides of the fenclaw thrashers make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If George can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in Serpent Lake, he'll be happy to share some of his armor. 
Advisor Faila asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to her in Stonebreaker Hold.	Arakkoa War Path	The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers. They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes. Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northeast. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can. 
Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers and return to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin.	Message to the Daggerfen	Of all the Lost One tribes in Zangarmarsh, the Daggerfen are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are highly organized and make no secret of the fact that they desire control over the other Lost Ones in the marsh. Their attacks have already taken quite a toll on my scouts and messengers. I cannot afford to lose any more men. If we don't act soon, they'll have complete control over the roads and Zabra'jin will effectively be surrounded. 
Free Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker at the Ruins of Sha'naar. Return to Naladu after completing this task.	The Dreghood Elders	The Dreghood spirit is broken because our elders are imprisoned. Take this key and go downstairs to free them. They are Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker. Once they are free, the spirits will return to the Dreghood tribe. 
Take the Burning Legion Missive to Magister Bloodhawk in Thrallmar.	Vile Plans	The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in Thrallmar that can transcribe such vile script - the blood elf Magister Bloodhawk. 
Falconer Drenna Riverwind wants you to offer your services to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.	Helping the Cenarion Post	Mechanic, there's some tauren by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance. She's with the Cenarion Expedition, and they've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the the road leading to Zangarmarsh. If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far. Do you think you might head over there and see what she needs? I don't want to have to bother Ranger Captain Venn'ren with such trivialities. 
Follow Trope the Filth-Belcher while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Trope the Filth-Belcher, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.	Dragonmaw Race: Trope the Filth-Belcher	Dragonmaw treat you right, George. Even a worn out cursed being like me is given a chance. Now if you want to prove your worth to the Skybreakers, you will have to defeat me. I'm going to shake you off my tail like a bad case of fleas...We'll lift off when you are ready. 
Zuben Elgenubi at the Stormspire wants you to obtain a Farahlite Core.	Hitting the Motherlode	Now that we've got a good baseline product, we're going to need something of higher quality. Certainly the farahlite we've gathered so far is nice, but I know there's better out there. We'll have to get a sample directly from Cragskaar, the patriarch of the Farahlon giants! You should be able to find it among the other giants in the Netherstone area. It's got huge pieces of farahlite jutting from its back and that's exactly what we need. Fell the giant and collect a farahlite core from it. 
Deal with Foreman Sundown inside the Trelleum Mine, which is underneath Manaforge Ara in the Netherstorm.	Dealing with the Foreman	The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine. Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from. Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation. Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves? Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown. The mine is around the back of the island to the left. 
Kill 8 Marshlight Bleeders and return to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.	Stinging the Stingers	It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it? I can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village. They're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, George, just quiet them! 
Locate and kill Mragesh, then return to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage.	Maktu's Revenge	Last time Maktu was out hunting hydras for hides at Serpent Lake, he was attacked by the biggest hydra he's ever seen. Maktu reached for his spear, but it was too late. He had just enough time to escape becoming hydra food. Who knows? Maybe next time, Maktu not be so lucky. Maktu wants to be there so there won't be a next time. Will you help Maktu get his revenge on Mragesh? 
Return to Thrallmar and speak with Nazgrel.	Return to Thrallmar	Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up. 
Vindicator Aluumen wants you to go to the Ruins of Baa'ri and slay 3 Ashtongue Handlers, 4 Ashtongue Warriors and 6 Ashtongue Shaman. Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.	The Ashtongue Tribe	The Ashtongue tribe is feared among all Broken. It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by Akama himself. They are as fierce and ruthless as any naga, demon or blood elf in Illidan's army and they have been deployed in large numbers at the Ruins of Baa'ri, southwest of here. Go there and put a dent in their numbers before they get a chance to mount an attack on us. 
Speak with Captain Kroghan at Garadar in Nagrand.	Warchief's Command: Nagrand!	The Warchief has asked for any able bodied champions of the Horde to ride to the aid of Garadar. The home of the Mag'har, lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake. Report to Captain Kroghan there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall! 
Rokag wants you to seek out Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath and demand that he and his people surrender to the Horde.	Surrender to the Horde	The cowardly arakkoa attack us daily. They ambush our hunters and sometimes even raid inside our walls. We kill them when we can, but their magic is strong and they often escape our warbands. I have learned that some arakkoa claim to be friendly with the Horde. They live in Shattrath City to the northwest. Rilak the Redeemed is their leader. Search for him in the Lower City, and when you find him, demand his surrender. 
Collect 30 pieces of Zeppelin Debris and bring them to ""Screaming"" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.	In Case of Emergency...	In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach. The good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the ""spare"" parts got scattered from here to the Valley of Bones to the east. The other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again? 
Kill 15 Sunfury Nethermancers and return to Nether-Stalker Oazul at Tuluman's Landing in the Netherstorm.	Neutralizing the Nethermancers	The blood elves are fools! I'm glad that our trade relations with them have fallen apart. In all of my travels throughout the cosmos, I have never encountered beings so selfish. They continue to destroy the land around us with their manaforges, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at Manaforge Ara. Their nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power. Go over there and wipe them out! 
Destroy The Ocular and then report to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.	It's All Fun and Games	The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help. The first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires. Our goblins have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will. 
Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to go to Sifreldar Village and rescue 5 Goblin Prisoners.	They Took Our Men!	You have to help us! We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked. They looked like vrykul, except their skin was blue and layered with frost... and they were all female! They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go. Please, George! We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking K3. 
Locate an Injured Rainspeaker Oracle for High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.	Just Following Orders	Okay <guy/lady>, Rakjak have very important job. You go capture injured big-tongue that tracker spotted at river to north. Not bring hunter this time because they maybe want to just kill it. I want to hide it so that I can poke it and make it tell me things. Go you and bring me big-tongue prize thing. 
Report to Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.	Honor Above All Else	Long has been the path to our salvation, young Mechanic. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge. Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise? Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, Mechanic! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post. 
Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.	A Strange Device	Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to connote any other kind of use. Perhaps the archmage back at Stars' Rest to the east of the Moonrest Gardens would be able to tell what it's used for? 
Seek out Gurgthock at the Amphitheater of Anguish in Zul'Drak.	The Champion's Call!	Pfft, what happens down here ain't fightin'. It's a couple of guys dancin' around a flag. You lookin' for some real action, buddy? 'Cause if you are I got the hottest ticket in town. Ever heard of Gurgthock and Wodin? Goblin and troll who ran the Ring of Blood back in Outland? Well they're here in Northrend and they've started up a whole new fight club over in Zul'Drak. If you're interested go to Zul'Drak, east of Crystalsong. They're at the big arena in the center. Tell 'em Shifty sent ya! 
Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran.	The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran	Hello, George. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there. When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke. 
Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Battered Hilt	This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art. The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Silver Covenant members would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representative at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds. 
You are to go to Dun Niffelem and ask King Jokkum to allow Thorim's armor to be reforged. After completing Jokkum's task, you are to speak with Njormeld in Dun Niffelem.	Forging an Alliance	<Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles.>This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, Human. Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators. Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes. Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance. 
Collect Crafty's Tools, an Overcharged Capacitor, and a Handful of Rocknar's Grit. Deliver them to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.	Just a Few More Things...	As you may have noticed, we created the airstrip on the southern border of a magnataur den!<Crafty says something uncharitable about Fizzcrank under her breath.>The old man has put me in charge of finding a... ahem... creative solution to this situation: if we don't deal with them soon, they'll come down here and tear us limb from limb! That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this shopping list. Please. 
Free 3 Captured Proto-Drakes and rescue 9 Brunnhildar Prisoners.	Cold Hearted	To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not....You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the Valley of Ancient Winters, and liberate our captive proto-drakes. With them, you will be able to free our sisters from their frozen bonds and carry them safely home. Beware the giants' clubs, sister, lest you find yourself numbered among the captives. 
	The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras!	I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand. These trolls are dirtier than ogres; but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Zul'Drak, pal. You're new to this racket, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match. If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say? 
Go through the Waygate in the southern end of Sholazar Basin and look for the weapon known as the Etymidian on the other side.	The Etymidian	It is time, George. The Waygate has been activated for the first time in seven centuries. Use it to travel to where our final hope lies. Let us put an end to those who would seek to bring the taint of undeath to this pristine land. Let us unleash the Etymidian. 
Samir at Granite Springs wants you to use the Bounty Hunter's Cage on a drakkari troll that's been stunned by Budd.	Filling the Cages	'Ol Budd's seen better days. Ever since our stay in Ghostlands he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder. Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit. See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak'Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll. 
Lok'lira the Crone inside the Forlorn Mine wants you to retrieve the Runes of the Yrkvinn from Overseer Syra.	The Crone's Bargain	Yes, it must be the little green prisoner you're after... We might be able to help each other. You're not going to get the goblin out of here by force. Not alive, anyway. Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions. As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner. If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them. Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra. She has my runes. Retrieve them and we'll talk some more. 
Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to defeat Drakuru. If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Watch to get another.	Betrayal	The time has come to end this charade, George. As valuable as your information has been, we must bring Drakuru down and bring his project to an end before his freaks are unleashed. We've modified your scepter for the job. When the time is right, you will be able to use it on Drakuru's Blightbloods and turn them against him. It's your only hope of defeating him. Fight well. 
Go to the Temple City of En'kilah and find the teleportation orb beneath the floating Scourge citadel of Naxxanar. Use it to reach the top and help Thassarian there.	Last Rites	I served Arthas in death, because I had no choice. He had control over my will and my body. The Cult of the Damned serves Arthas in life... willingly. Now that we know the words of power to enter Naxxanar we can put an end to the cultist blight. Go to En'kilah and look for the teleportation orb beneath the floating citadel. Work your way up and meet me at the top. Arm yourself with what courage you can, we might not make it out of this alive. 
	The Champion of Anguish	This is the end, my friend! Your last opponent is going to be your greatest challenge. He's a vrykul champion from the steppes of Icecrown and he's out for blood! Defeat him and you'll be crowned the champion of the Amphitheater of Anguish! This fight is going to make us both rich! Let me know when you're ready and we'll start. 
Thorim at the Temple of Storms wants you to Kill Fjorn and 5 Stormforged Iron Giants at Fjorn's Anvil, east of Dun Niffelem. Using Thorim's Charm of Earth will summon his Earthen to fight by your side. The charm requires a Granite Boulder from nearby Fjorn's Anvil.	Mending Fences	If I hope to wrest control of the Temple of the Makers from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies. Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants. Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the Sons of Hodir to emerge victorious. Take this charm, George. Use it to summon my earthen to your aid. 
Use an Argent Cannon to destroy 100 Scourge attackers. You must also kill 3 Frostbrood Destroyers. Return to Siegemaster Fezzik should you succeed.	The Last Line Of Defense	I've triggered the base's defenses, Mechanic! Atop each of the Vanguard's four towers is a retractable Argent Crusade cannon, blessed by Father Gustav himself. You'll need to fly up to one of those towers and man a cannon. Use it to destroy the Scourge onslaught that the Lich King has deployed. Just one warning, the Scourge will undoubtedly send their frost wyrms to lay siege to the towers. Shoot them out of the sky! If they destroy the walls and towers of this base, we're done for! 
Use the Augmented Arcane Prison to summon and speak to Keristrasza.	Keristrasza	I am... free? I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal. When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness. Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done. I need your help, George. 
Baron Sliver at the Shadow Vault wants you to use the Sovereign Rod on the corpses of Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper.	Free Your Mind	Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper would make excellent weapons in the fight against the Lich King if they can be broken from his will. That is what the Sovereign Rod is for. You'll find them on the ledges to the east and west of the vault, as well as on the mid-tier of the vault above us. The rod is to be used upon the corpses of the three. Fly now. We will have them as our own! 
Give Salrand's Key to Warmage Anzim when you are ready to free Evanor.	Taking Wing	The key is forged anew. Now heed my counsel, Human. Succeed in your endeavor or die trying, for if a single scale falls from one of my drakes I shall hold you personally accountable. Now, off with you. 
Toss Tasty Reef Fish at a Reef Bull to lead it to a Reef Cow. Once you have helped the two to find true love, return to Anuniaq at Kamagua.	The Way to His Heart...	The Northsea Pirates slaughtered the isles' alpha sea lion bull, Big Roy. They made soap from him to clean the decks of their ships!<Anuniaq sighs.>Now the sea lions won't mate. Help me to repopulate their numbers. The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles. Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow. 
Speak with Gymer to begin. While riding Gymer, destroy 100 Scourge and kill Algar the Chosen, Thrym and Prince Navarius. Report to Crusader MacKellar at Crusader Forward Camp should you succeed.	The Storm King's Vengeance	My people have been decimated by the Lich King. The Scourge now use the corpses of storm giants to create mindless flesh giants, or worse, stitched together aberrations like Thrym. I will stop at nothing to see them all driven from this world. We will work together to destroy the Scourge that threaten Zul'Drak. We will kill them all: Navarius, Algar and Thrym! When you are ready, let me know and we will begin our destructive journey. 
Devrestrasz at Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to slay 3 Azure Dragons, slay 5 Azure Drakes, and to destabilize the Azure Dragonshrine while riding a Wyrmrest Defender into battle.	Defending Wyrmrest Temple	Emboldened by the overabundance of magic now flowing through the Azure Dragonshrine, the blue dragonflight has dared to attack Wyrmrest Temple itself! I ask that you ride one of our defenders into battle to slay their dragons and drakes, and to attack the eruption of ley line energies at the dragonshrine itself in order to destabilize it. Outside on the east and west terraces are wyrmrest defenders. Speak with one to ride it into battle. Without your help, George, we will surely lose. 
Venture to Crusaders' Pinnacle and use the Blessed Banner of the Crusade atop the Pile of Crusader Skulls. Defend the banner against Scourge attack until the land atop the pinnacle is sanctified and then return to Father Gustav at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown.	The Battle For Crusaders' Pinnacle	<Highlord Fordring holds a banner of the Argent Crusade.>This banner is like no other, George. It carries with it a powerful blessing, able to sanctify large tracts of blighted land. You must take it northwest, through the Breach, to an area the Scourge have mockingly named Crusaders' Pinnacle. Plant the banner atop the skulls of our fallen brethren at Crusaders' Pinnacle and defend it against attack. Once the land is sanctified, return to Father Gustav. Go now, George. Hold no fear in your heart. 
Empower the Runestaff of Nordrassil with 250 Soul Flame Essences and obtain the Heart of Flame.	Heart of Flame	You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, George, and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect. My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen Tarecgosa's bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home. I would have you venture one last time into the Plane of Fire and bring me the heart of Ragnaros. When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done. 
Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to rescue an Icemaw Matriarch in the Hibernal Cavern.	The Last of Her Kind	For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east. Those times might finally be gone. The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct. If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity. Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch. Good luck finding one. 
Kill Artruis the Heartless. Moodle will not be able to accompany you on this task.	A Hero's Burden	Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done. We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... the Sundered Shard. The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway. I'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say... I'll leave the rest up to you. 
Bring Crusader Bridenbrad's Tabard to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle.	Light Within the Darkness	<Crusader Bridenbrad's tabard rests in the bottom of the chest, shifting slightly as the howling wind finds its way in.>Tirion will desire this last remnant of the great crusader. 
Crusader Silverdawn wants you to mount an Argent Hippogryph, throw 8 Flaming Spears at the North Sea Kraken and take out 6 Vrykul Deepcallers. You can find the Argent Hippogryphs right outside the Argent Crusade tent at the Tournament Grounds.	Get Kraken!	The Sunreavers and Silver Covenant sent ships north to engage the Kvaldir at Hrothgar's Landing, but were intercepted and detained by a Kvaldir Raiding vessel. To make matters worse, the Kvaldir have found a way to call forth the dreaded Kraken that lives beneath the North Sea. If anyone on board is to get out alive, that Kraken must be driven away and the Kvaldir's summoning ritual ... disrupted. Crusader, take these spears and an Argent Hippogryph will take you to the battle. 
Keristrasza wants you to use the Power Focus to lure Saragosa, and then defeat her.	Saragosa's End	Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus. Saragosa is a glutton. She will be unable to resist its lure. Inside it lie magics that will greatly diminish her power. Let us hope she does not see through my ruse....Prepare yourself, George, and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa. 
Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to obtain 3 Icemane Yeti Hides.	Making a Harness	So you want to ride? Well, if you've made it this far someone must think you've got a shot at the Hyldsmeet. First things first; we'll have to make you a harness. In the cliffs to the south, you'll find scattered groups of yeti. Their hides are tough and just the right thickness. Bring me some and we'll get you started on the path of the bear-rider. 
Bring Pitch's Remains to Tamara Wobblesprocket at Lakeside Landing.	The Part-time Hunter	When Hemet asked me to accompany Marvin out here, I hoped that I might have the opportunity to work on my own hunting skills in between repairing the flying machines and setting up the camp. I wanted to take down a ferocious lion named Pitch. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the Wildgrowth Mangal meets the northern face of the Skyreach Pillar. If you can find the beast, would you bring back his remains? If the rumors are true, they'd make a trophy even Hemet will respect! 
Use the Enchanted Bridle to gain control of the Black Knight's Gryphon and ride it to its destination. Once you have arrived, recover the Stolen Tournament Invitation and the Black Knight's Orders and bring them to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Black Knight's Orders	We must discover who sent the Black Knight to the tournament and what his master hopes to gain by killing the competitors. The Kirin Tor has offered to help in this matter and provided us with something to help our search. Take this enchanted bridle to the Black Knight's camp on the eastern edge of the tournament grounds and use it to gain control over the Black Knight's gryphon. The bridle's magic will force the gryphon to take you to his master's home. Search it and return with anything you find. 
Defeat Ironhide inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward.	The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling!	So you're interested in the fights, eh? Well, Krenna has outlawed pit-fighting for all enlisted combatants. But you, my friend, are technically a free agent and are not included in this prohibition. Nice loophole, eh? Anyway, if you're interested I can start you off with something easy, a measly bear. I'll even let you bring friends along! 
Speak to Sky-Reaver Klum to secure passage to Orgrim's Hammer in Icecrown, and then report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar.	Preparations for War	You there! You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown. The Alliance scum rushed into Icecrown ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth - Orgrim's Hammer. The Alliance don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas. Speak to me when you're ready to depart and lend a hand. 
Place a Destructive Ward at the end of the path leading out of Obsidian Dragonshrine, where the road starts to give way to snow. Protect the ward until it is fully charged, then return to Serinar.	No Place to Run	They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers...I have no love for the cult, but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them... not that I ever would have anyway. Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine... where the road starts to give way to snow. Defend it until it is fully charged. 
Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy 3 Chained Abominations with Burning Skeletons.	Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton	The workers in the Fleshwerks abomination lab have already completed a number of their creations. For now, the creatures are chained to the pillars around the edge of the lab, but if we do not act, they will march with the Lich King's armies. Grasping arms reach out of the bone piles spread throughout the Fleshwerks. These arms belong to skeletons enchanted with the power of fire. Find and free these skeletons, then take them near the completed abominations and watch the show! 
Use the Earthen Mining Pick to mine 7 clumps of Enchanted Earth. Bring the earth and 5 Frostweave Cloth to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.	Rare Earth	It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from Ulduar saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors. As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing. We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help? 
Raelorasz wants you to use Raelorasz's Spear to subdue a Nexus Drake Hatchling and return it to him at the Transitus Shield.	Drake Hunt	The blues have begun to cover their drakes in mysterious runes. I must discover their significance.<Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.>Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires. Their hatchlings feed around the northwest edge of the valley. 
Endorah wants you to go to Amber Ledge north of Warsong Hold and thank those there for rescuing her.	Too Close For Comfort	I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me? I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded! A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking! I never thanked them for saving me. Please, Mechanic, find them, and pass on my gratitude. 
Locate Serfex under the sands of the southern river, slay him, and bring his claw to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill. If you lose Dajik's Worn Chalk, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	The Underground Menace	Lion killer, chicken chaser, new Frenzyheart slave...I know you no want to stay slave, so I tell you what to do. Show you better than the other Frenzyheart hunters and then Rakjak respect you. Under sands of south river there a beast that kills wasp, apes, and even wolvar. He called Serfex. You bring claw of Serfex to Rakjak and maybe he release you from slaveness. Hope Dajik teaching you good so Serfex be easy stuff. 
Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to destroy a Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm, Weakened Turgid the Vile, and Weakened Overseer Deathgaze.	That Which Creates Can Also Destroy	Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use. Your targets are one of the reanimated frost wyrms circling to the north near Galakrond's Rest, Turgid the Vile in the ruined barracks at the Carrion Fields to the east, and Overseer Deathgaze at Jintha'kalar far to the northeast. While the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser Scourge, they will greatly weaken these three. Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own. 
You must collect 10 Furious Sparks from the Seething Revenants at Frostfield Lake and then use the anvil at Fjorn's Anvil.	The Refiner's Fire	Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality. You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil. As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a fire revenant crosses your path... 
Vindicator Yaala wants you to use the Oculus of the Exorcist in three different locations in Valiance Keep to uncover and defeat Cult of the Damned members.	The Hunt is On	I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language. Vurenn was right. The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen. Take this oculus. Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura. Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens. 
You are to bring the Refined Gleaming Ore to Thorim in the Temple of Storms.	A Spark of Hope	Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal. Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool. Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim's runes shining beneath the surface.... 
Use the Hyldnir Harpoon to defeat 10 Hyldsmeet Drakeriders at the Temple of Storms.	The Drakkensryd	This is it. You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet... all but one. You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest. The final test is at hand. The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit. It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance. Show no quarter. None will be expected. 
Thoralius the Wise at Valgarde wants you to find his Reagent Pouch.	Into the World of Spirits	While the Explorers' League may discern bits and pieces of the past through their archaeological findings and the Vice Admiral might extract some knowledge of the present through brute force, the truth lies with the spirits. With the proper reagents I am able to see into the spirit world. It is there that the past, present and future of Northrend resides. If you wish to learn more, I will require my reagent pouch. It was lost in a ship that is now at the bottom of Daggercap Bay, just east of here. 
Donathan wants you to use the Arcane Binder on a wounded Beryl Sorcerer at Beryl Point and return to Amber Ledge with him.	Abduction	George, we have a situation. I've just learned that one of our archmages en route from Dalaran has gone missing. Naturally, we suspect the mage hunters are behind her disappearance. Time is clearly of the essence. We must know what has become of Lady Evanor at once if we are to have any hope of rescuing her. Take this device. Return to Beryl Point and use it on a Beryl sorcerer when he is near death. It should bind him long enough for you to bring him here for questioning. 
Seek out High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker flying above Icecrown.	The Skybreaker	We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting! At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, Human? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance. 
Collect a sample of Rockflesh from the Ice Giant corpse at the cavern entrance in the Crystal Vice, north of Zort's location. After this task is complete, return to Zort near the center of the canyon.	Slim Pickings	Cold out here, isn't it, Human? Ko'char has refused to meet with me. It seems he has more pressing things on his mind - namely, the jormungar that have been attacking them from the cavern below. Maybe you can help me convince Ko'char that I'm one of the good guys. I saw a giant being eaten by some of the worms at the entrance to the cavern north of here... I'm still puzzled as to how the worms are killing them so easily. Bring me a sample from one of his wounds. 
Deliver an Onslaught Gryphon to Uzo Deathcaller at Death's Rise.	You'll Need a Gryphon	What could be more fitting than to take one of their own gryphons to use against them? Go to Onslaught Harbor and take the reins to one of their gryphons from the dead clutches of its rider. Return with the gryphon, delivering it to Uzo Deathcaller. He will see to its proper transformation and provide you with further instructions. 
Report back to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.	The Shadow Vault	It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the Knights of the Ebon Blade in the process.<Thassarian gazes out over the horizon.>You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other death knights will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the Scourge. I'm sure they'll need your help. 
Tirion Fordring, at the Crusader's Pinnacle, wants you to obtain and wear a Cultist Acolyte's Hood and meet him at the entrance of the Cathedral of Darkness, northwest of Icecrown Citadel.	Tirion's Gambit	Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact. And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity. This is a sign of the Light. As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again! Meet me at the cathedral's entrance. Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito. 
Seek out Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer flying above Icecrown.	Orgrim's Hammer	The Argent Crusade pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, Human. My axe sang as it cut down Alliance filth and Scourge alike. My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier. Our base flies out of reach of Scourge - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called ""Orgrim's Hammer.""<Hork futilely attempts to salute.>Fly high and avoid the Alliance juggernaut, Skybreaker. Tell Korm... tell him I died... fighting... For the Horde. 
Kill Broodmother Slivina and return to Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.	Post-partum Aggression	Broodmother Slivina's likely to be a snarling ball of teeth, spikes, and talons. You've gone and stolen her children away and no mother takes kindly to that.'Tis true they hatched from eggs, but she loves the little beasts no less than your mother loves you. She'll be desperate and fierce in equal measures, everything Hemet loves in a target. You and he, along with that mammoth, should be a match for her. She's on her perch at the northern edge of the Savage Thicket and hungers for revenge. 
Defeat the Black Knight and then speak to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Black Knight's Fall	We must put an end to the Black Knight's scheming, and show those who oppose us that we will not stand by and allow our champions to be murdered. By now, he will suspect that someone is on his trail. Challenge him in the light of day, where he cannot refuse or murder in the dark, George. Use my argent charger for the battle. It's housed in the stables. Speak to Squire Cavin at the Ring of Champions. The squire will call the Black Knight to battle, but you will make him answer for his crimes. 
Bring 1 Orange, 2 Banana Bunches, and 1 Papaya to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor	Life's tossed me a cartload of lemons this time! When the ship ran aground, the kegs carrying my best brew burst! All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition! We need to get some booze cooking, and fast!!The trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach. Look for good, strong vines, see if you can use it to shake some of that fruit out of the trees. Bring me whatever you can find. 
Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest.	Return To Myralion Sunblaze	We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men. Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King. 
Utaik wants you to gather 8 Kaskala Supplies in Kaskala.	Preparing for the Worst	Dark times are upon us. Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead tuskarr. The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren. Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes. There is hope yet. Not for us perhaps, but we've sent our families to Unu'pe. We fight here so there may be a future for them. They will need supplies or they will starve. There's not enough food in Unu'pe. Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families. 
Corastrasza on the upper ring of the Nexus in Coldarra wants you to ride her drake and kill 5 Scalesworn Elites.	Aces High!	You possess the courage to draw so near to Malygos' lair, mortal? Or is it simply ignorance? Soon we shall know....I am a seasoned trainer of the graceful drakes of the red dragonflight. My business here is to study the enemy and teach my precious pets the tactics that will be most effective when we face the master of the blues. To demonstrate your nerve and ability, I will allow you to ride one of my drakes against the enemy's minions. The opportunity is yours for the asking... 
Midge in Valiance Keep wants you to go to Amber Ledge to the north and thank those there for rescuing her.	Nick of Time	I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me? I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts. I was surrounded! A huge magical cube appeared above me. It opened up and pulled me inside. I swear it's true! Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of drakes - It was amazing! My captors scattered and I was able to escape. I never thanked them for saving me. Please, Mechanic, if you see them, pass on my gratitude. 
Find the entrance to the Forlorn Mine in northern Sifreldar Village and look for clues for Zeev Fizzlespark's whereabouts.	Leave No Goblin Behind	All of our boys are back... thanks to you, George! Well... all but one. My brother Zeev is still up there according to the others. Apparently they have some sort of mine where they make their prisoners work. Go in there and see if you can find out anything. 
Deliver the Key to the Focusing Iris to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight.	The Key to the Focusing Iris	A potent thrumming of magical nature can be heard and felt emanating from the eye-shaped jewel dropped from Sapphiron's clutches. To mortal ears it is nearly painful to be in the presence of the stone. Surely such a powerful item of import can only be taken to the queen of the dragons, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. Seek her counsel atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight. 
Zul'tore at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring him Winter's Edge.	The Edge Of Winter	Curse that death knight for breaking my sword! In southern Crystalsong Forest, overlooking the Crystal Vice's exit, you will find Lord Everblaze. Kill him and take the everburning ember from his corpse. Bring it to the center of Winter's Breath Lake in northern Howling Fjord, and use it to free the maiden encased in ice. She is the guardian of an ancient sword and will award it to whoever frees her. Prove your worth and earn the weapon that she has guarded for so long, George. 
Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield needs you to kill Arcane Serpents near the Nexus and collect 5 Nexus Mana Essences from them.	Keep the Secret Safe	Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, Malygos' minions would have us. One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise. I could use your help, George. Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of. 
Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Zul'tore at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	A Worthy Weapon	Of all the times to have such rotten luck! My tournament blade has gone missing. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade. 
Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Runok Wildmane at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	A Blade Fit For A Champion	I've heard that the Alliance champions are seeking after ancient blades for their warriors. We can't afford to let them have that kind of advantage. There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, George. Otherwise, you'll catch warts. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Large Barrel, Industrial Strength Rope and Dark Iron Ingots.	We Can Rebuild It	Tools? Check. Materials? Negative. If we're going to build this thing, you're going to have to get me the materials. First things first, George. For the skeletal structure I'm going to need a large barrel from Nifflevar, some dark iron ingots from Valgarde, and industrial strength rope from Baleheim. Nifflevar and Baleheim are vrykul towns northwest of here. Valgarde is located in Daggercap Bay, also to the northwest. Speak with McGoyver to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done. 
The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to use Freya's Horn atop of the Glimmering Pillar.	The Lifewarden's Wrath	We were not quick enough, George. The cultist scum have arrived at the Glimmering Pillar and are making preparations to destroy it, I can sense them. We don't have much time. Blow upon this horn atop the Glimmering Pillar to channel my power through the crystal. We shall show this scum to not trifle with the titans' creations. 
Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Prince Sandoval. Should you succeed, speak with Gjonner the Merciless overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas: Final Challenge	I'm afraid that your success is going to be your undoing, George.<If the val'kyr could turn more white, she would.>Word of your success in Valhalas has reached deep into Icecrown Citadel, stirring one whom you have no desire to meet. Prince Sandoval himself is on his way at this very moment. Gjonner warned you that you should run and I cannot disagree. What will you do? He's on his way. Will you face the blood prince in final battle? 
Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to recover the Harpoon Operation Manual.	The Path to Payback	Two weeks ago our chief engineer got his hands on a vrykul harpoon gun - the same type of gun that the vrykul use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual. Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual! 
Challenge Agnetta Tyrsdottar in order to save Zeev Fizzlespark. Return to Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village after you've succeeded.	Is That Your Goblin?	I trust that's the green little one you've been looking for. If I were you I'd step in before that Hyldnir splits him in half. You've arrived in the middle of the Hyldsmeet, so all challenges must be accepted by participants. There's nothing to stop you from taking your green friend's place. 
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to Justicar Mariel Trueheart at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	A Victory For The Silver Covenant	In spite of Queen Lana'thel's boasting, you have restored Quel'Delar, George. Long have we dreamt of reclaiming Quel'Delar. The Silver Covenant, and indeed all quel'dorei owe you a debt of gratitude. As a Mechanic, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? Perhaps the Argent Crusade can find one. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Silver Covenant. 
Raelorasz wants you to use Raelorasz' Spark at the signal fire in Coldarra.	Springing the Trap	We owe this opportunity in great part to your efforts, George. It is only fitting that you initiate the attack on Malygos. Take this spark and use it to light the signal fire northwest of the Nexus. Keristrasza will direct you from there. 
Collect 1000 Seething Cinders from the Firelands.	Time Grows Short	Tarecgosa is bound to you, George, but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence. Malygos's successor will not be chosen until Azeroth's moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then. Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the Plane of Fire, with which you've become familiar. Obtain them, Mechanic, and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse. 
Speak with Geirrvif in Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas	I see and hear many things, George, and something very important has happened since your defeat of Overthane Balargarde: you are wanted for battle in Valhalas! You will find the battle pit to the north. Go now with your friends and speak with Geirrvif the val'kyr. The challengers that she will offer you within Valhalas are sure to require their help. Good luck. 
	Hodir's Tribute

Lab Work	I assume by your interruption that you wish to be numbered among those I am considering for apprenticeship. A worthy aspiration...Should I someday choose to accept your petition, I must be confident that you can find your way around my laboratory. I have many ingredients here; some plentiful, and others in short supply. Take your time, Mechanic. Find a muddy mire maggot, a withered batwing, an amberseed, and some chilled serpent mucus.

Seek out Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle in Icecrown.

Travel once more through the Breach and seek out the highlord! 
Use a Tamed Jormungar to defeat the Iron Colossus and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.	The Iron Colossus	We have failed to prevent the completion of the iron colossus, George, which means we have no choice but to face it in battle. Bruor has devised a plan to exploit the colossus' only weakness. No matter how tough the colossus' armor is, it is still vulnerable to a jormungar's acid. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains, then use it to fight the iron colossus on the Snowdrift Plains. If you need help controlling the creature, speak to one of the nearby handlers. 
Killinger the Den Watcher at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Nedar, Lord of Rhinos and his companion, ""Lunchbox.""	Nedar, Lord of Rhinos...	West of here, on the high bluffs above Lake Kum'uya, roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed ""Lord of Rhinos"" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against his cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Nedar has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard. It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Nedar's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me. 
Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use the Levine Family Termites to lure Foreman Kaleiki out and kill him.	A Means to an End	I received a few barrels of termites from my sister at the Bulwark back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you. The lumbermill operations at New Hearthglen are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman. I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running. Ready to take him out, Mechanic? 
Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch to defeat Kirgaraak.	The Warm-Up	You've been very fortunate, sister. This is a matriarch the likes of which hasn't been seen in years. A good bear won't do you much good without the skill to ride it. I'm going to have you practice some moves on Kirgaraak. He's the largest yeti we've ever managed to capture so be careful. Don't be afraid to walk away if he gives you a beating... there's a reason why we keep him chained. 
Mount and take control of Nergeld. Defend it from the denizens of the Hall of Horrors until Dr. Terrible shows himself. Use Nergeld to slay the doctor, and then return to The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village.	The Sum is Greater than the Parts	Opening the tome, you notice all manner of disgusting illustrations concerning the construction of what the doctor refers to as ""the ultimate weapon""!Clearly the prototype, Nergeld, is the massive flesh giant standing still at the end of the nearby Hall of Horrors. If an army of those things were to be constructed, then it would mean doom. The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to slay Dr. Terrible! Perhaps if you were to take control of the construct, the doctor would reveal himself? 
Report to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill as the new ""slave.""	Playing Along	My kill! You take my kill!<Gekgek taunts you with his spear.>You dumb, Human. Now you owe Gekgek! You be Frenzyheart slave. You slay many more beasts for Frenzyheart. You go Frenzyheart Hill to northeast - you tell High-Shaman Rakjak you the new slave. Go, Human!

Deliver Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains and the Scales of Goramosh to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.	Prevent the Accord	We need to kill two birds with one stone here, Mechanic. You're the stone. Our two birds are Wind Trader Mu'fah and Goramosh. They should be somewhere in the western half of the Moonrest Gardens. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit. I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind. 
Obtain a Spool of Thread and the Doctor's Cleaver, then take them to the Sanctum of Reanimation Slab and use Olakin's remains to attempt to reanimate the crusader. Return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch when this task is complete.	Putting Olakin Back Together Again	We can't afford to waste any time putting Olakin back together. Fortunately, the Scourge has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together. Near the Fleshwerks' flesh giant lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation. Search the area for a spool of thread and the doctor's cleaver. Then, take Olakin's remains to the large slab in the middle of the sanctum and get to work. 
Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to use the Scepter of Command on Bloated Abominations and then use their abilities at the Frigid Breach to kill 60 Drakkari Skullcrushers and lure out 3 Drakkari Chieftains. Chieftains will appear when enough Skullcrushers have been slain.	Fuel for the Fire	It be time we start our march to Gundrak, mon. It be time for me ta turn ya loose on dem trolls!

Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to Koltira Deathweaver aboard the gunship, Orgrim's Hammer.	If He Cannot Be Turned	Death knights, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the Lich King's will except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper in to help you. If we are to finally own The Shadow Vault, General Lightsbane must fall! 
Librarian Serrah wants you to speak to Corastrasza in Coldarra.	Corastrasza	Greetings, Mechanic. Might I impose on you for a favor? Corastrasza is the sister of Raelorasz - the red dragon in charge of our outpost here. Against his will, she has ascended to one of the upper rings of the Nexus to observe some frighteningly powerful blue drakes. Though he will never say it, he worries about her, and would welcome any news of her well-being. Please seek her out. Ask her to put her pride aside and send word to her brother. 
Collect the Branch of Nordrassil at Amber Ledge in Borean Tundra.	Nordrassil's Bough	Much has transpired since last we spoke. I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover Anachronos's artifact, but not before using it for myself. Now I too have witnessed that which you have seen. Before discussing the matter further, allow me to express my gratitude to you for your assistance, both here and in the Plane of Fire. 
Drakuru wants you to bring the Eye of the Prophets to him at Drakuru's Brazier in Zeb'Halak. You will need to collect Zim'bo's Mojo to use Drakuru's Elixir there.

Librarian Garren at Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at Winterfin Caverns.	Monitoring the Rift: Winterfin Cavern	I need to compile my notes and prepare a presentation for my colleagues in Dalaran. While I do, I must ask that you visit the Winterfin Cavern to the north. You must use the Arcanometer while standing in the mouth of the cavern. Return to me at once when you have the data. My documentation will be incomplete without it. 
Speak with Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament grounds to enroll in the tournament.	The Argent Tournament	We have invited you here to test your skill and valor against others who have bravely opposed the Scourge. Many have been our divisions, but the time has come for heroes fighting under all banners to test their blades against one another in preparation for facing our mutual enemy. Magister Edien Sunhollow is the Sunreaver representative to the tournament and he'll enter your name into the rolls and begin your training. Seek him out inside the large Horde tent in the southeastern part of the grounds. 
Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups. Deliver them to Trapper Mau'i at Moa'ki Harbor.	Planning for the Future	We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain. The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance. If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them. While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me. 
Librarian Donathan on Amber Ledge wants you to collect the Beryl Prison Key from one of the Beryl Mage Hunters at Beryl Point and use it to release a trapped mage from an arcane prison.	Prison Break	Greetings, Mechanic. I am Donathan, a loyal representative of Dalaran. Forgive my abruptness, but we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis. Mages all across Azeroth are being abducted and I have been authorized to conscript anyone able to assist in the unraveling of this mystery. The camp just south of ours is where our investigation begins. I call upon you to rescue one of the imprisoned mages held there. You must obtain a key from one of the mage hunters and use it to open an arcane prison. 
Drakuru wants you to collect the Drakkari Tablets from the Ruins of Drakil'jin and 5 Sacred Mojo from Drakkari Oracles and Protectors there. You are then to use Drakuru's Elixir at Drakuru's Brazier at the ruins to summon his image.	Voices From the Dust	<Drakuru places the Eye of the Prophets on his brow and the Heart of the Ancients on his chest.>We be close, mon, very close! The Drakkari Tablets be all dat remain ta be found.

Emissary Brighthoof at the Westwind Refugee Camp in the Dragonblight wants you to recover 10 Horde Armaments.	Into the Fold	Before we can officially bring these taunka into the Horde we must recover our armaments from the Anub'ar Nerubians that infest the nearby woods. The armaments were lost when a caravan from Agmar's Hammer was ambushed by the Scourge late last night. Venture out into the woods to the east of Westwind Refugee Camp and recover those armaments, Human. 
Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village wants you to bring him 5 Steam Cured Hides.	Patching Up	Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me? Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this flying machine is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly. Dorain over there has been telling me that the taunka use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the Flood Plains to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the Geyser Fields. 
Seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.	Hellscream's Champion	You have faced all challenges that have been set before you and squashed them beneath your boot heel. It is because of you, George, that the Horde is now firmly entrenched in Northrend. But our work has only just begun. We must march to Icecrown and we must tear down its walls! Your next assignment begins to the east, at Taunka'le Village. Our taunka allies are in dire straits and require aid. Secure transport from the stable master, Durkot Wolfbrother, and seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le. 
Speak with Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit inside of Magmoth.	Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit	You must go to Magmoth to the east. You must descend into the depths of their caverns. You must speak with Farseer Grimwalker's spirit! 
Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle has requested that you secure passage from Arch Druid Lilliandra and speak to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade.	The Keeper's Favor	There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light. And Bridenbrad, this is no ordinary man... his valor and devotion shine through. We can only hope that one of these beings will intervene and bring this hero back from a fate worse than death. Go now and speak to Arch Druid Lilliandra in the Argent Vanguard... request passage to Moonglade and seek the aid of Keeper Remulos. 
You are to use Hodir's Spear to challenge a Wild Wyrm in the Valley of Ancient Winters. Once in its grip, you are to fight to the death.	How To Slay Your Dragon	Hodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle. Its mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter Dun Niffelem. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities. Scanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby. It is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise.... 
Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar.	Basic Chemistry	<Thassarian takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask.>A little-known quality of the flesh giants...Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid. Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers. Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate. 
Drakuru at Granite Springs wants you to use the Dull Carving Knife near his cage and then speak to him.	Truce?	Watch yerself, mon. Drakuru shrunk more Human heads than I can remember - and even if I could remember, I couldn't count that high. Lucky for you I be stuck in dis cage or I'd be addin' one more to da list. But things bein' what they are, mebbe we be puttin' our differences aside fer a time, eh? Drakuru know things, mon. Things that will aid you in your struggle here.<Drakuru cuts the palm of his hand on one of his tusks and extends it through the cage.>So, what you say, mon... truce? 
Rescue 3 Captured Argent Crusaders from Scourgeholme and drop them off at the Vanguard Infirmary at the center of the Argent Vanguard. Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring should you succeed.	Into The Wild Green Yonder	We will do all that we can to assist you, George. The proto-brood have volunteered to fly you across the Breach and into Scourgeholme. Rescue any captured Argent Crusaders that you find. Return them immediately to the Vanguard Infirmary, located at the center of this base. Choose one of the Argent Skytalons in the pen behind me and go! Scourgeholme is located northwest, across the Valley of Echoes, through the great Breach. 
Find Leviroth in the waters below the iceberg floating among the northern edge of Riplash Ruins. Use the Trident of Naz'jan to slay him and return to Karuk to the north of Riplash Strand.	The Emissary	Raj Naz'jan was the emperor of Riplash when Leviroth was imprisoned. Azshara herself blessed his trident so it would slay the beast should it ever escape. Now you wield it, Human. As much as it disgusts me, I will have my revenge on these barbaric giant-men. Take the trident to the depths beneath Riplash. You will find Leviroth below an iceberg closest to northern Riplash. Drive the trident into his flesh and slay him! Return to whomever sent you when you're done; I wish to see no more of you. 
The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has asked you to beat information out of Apprentice Osterkilgr concerning what Dr. Terrible is truly up to. You are then to slay the apprentice.	Deep in the Bowels of The Underhalls	Deep in the bowels of The Underhalls to the northeast, a mad scientist known as Dr. Terrible is up to something befitting his name. The doctor has been given dispensation by the Lich King to perform experiments upon the vargul -- the vrykul who fall in battle and are found unworthy, and then turned into Scourge. We must put an end to his work, but my auguries have been unable to find him. He does, however, have an assistant. Beat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body. 
Find Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in Howling Fjord.	Orfus of Kamagua	Hail, traveler. I am Lunk-tusk of the Kalu'ak. We are known as tuskarr to your people. My partner and I were recently sent up to investigate strange happenings along one of our hunting trails. It was when we approached the graveyard known as Shield Hill that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus. We parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok? 
Gather 3 Essences of the Monsoon and 3 Essences of the Storm and take them to the Shrine of the Tempest. Return to Rejek at Frenzyheart Hill with the True Power of the Tempest.	Strength of the Tempest	Silly big-tongues think singing to the clouds give them power. Rejek show big-tongues how to get power by taking it! Far to northwest, there is large, flat area the big-tongues call 'Stormwright's Shelf.' Rejek is sure you can only get there by flying like bird. On this shelf, Rejek has heard of mighty forces of wind and water. Kill them for their badness, then take it to the big-tongue 'Shrine of the Tempest' at shelf's western side. Rejek will await your return with ultimate power. 
Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to go to Voltarus and complete any tasks Drakuru has for you. While there, you are to steal 5 Harvested Blight Crystals. If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Watch to get another.	Hazardous Materials	Blight crystals?! What could this scumbag Drakuru be up to? Clearly, he's working on something significant. Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans. In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals. While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking. Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail. 
Obtain a Large Femur from a Skeletal Woodcutter and use it to incapacitate Maloric. Search Maloric for evidence, then report back to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	There's Something About the Squire	Every day, the Black Knight's squire, Maloric, makes a big show of heading to Crystalsong Forest with his axe over his shoulder. He wants us to believe he's chopping wood, but he never returns with more than a few twigs. He usually goes toward the ruins southwest of the Mirror of Twilight. He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight. Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it. 
Deliver the Heroic Key to the Focusing Iris to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight.	The Heroic Key to the Focusing Iris	A potent thrumming of magical nature can be heard and felt emanating from the eye-shaped jewel dropped from Sapphiron's clutches. To mortal ears it is nearly painful to be in the presence of the stone. Surely such a powerful item of import can only be taken to the queen of the dragons, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. Seek her counsel atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight. 
Find the Moonrest Gardens Plans and return them to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.	Rifle the Bodies	The Moonrest Gardens to the southwest were the final resting place of a noble group of Highborne elves. It was also a powerful ley line nexus. The blue dragonflight used a magical device they call a surge needle to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will. I need more information and I hope that you will get it for me. After the upheaval at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters present. Go rifle their corpses for clues. 
The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to kill Salranax the Flesh Render, Underking Talonox and High Priest Yath'amon.	The Air Stands Still	You must defeat the lords of Scourgeholme if this place is to be free of the Scourge's grasp. Salranax the Flesh Render lords over the temple on the first tier of Scourgeholme. Nearby Salranax you'll find High Priest Yath'amon preaching at the spirit tower on the second tier. Underking Talonox holds court at the Pit of Fiends, up the high road. These are formidable opponents and must be approached with caution. Use this war horn should you require aid. The death knights of Acherus will come. 
Help Jenny make her way from the crash site to Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village without losing all her cargo.	Load'er Up!	Have you seen the flying machines buzzing around? That's gnomish innovation at its finest. I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the Scalding Pools, in the southwest part of the Geyser Fields. Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, Jenny will answer. She'll follow you and carry the salvage, but you must keep her safe. She'll begin to drop the cargo if attacked. 
Capture the Silver Covenant Orders.	The Silver Covenant's Scheme	One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something. Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do. 
Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple.	What The Dragons Know	There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recall seeing or hearing of a sword with these markings, but that doesn't mean that all is lost. Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Arcanist Tybalin inside the Silver Enclave in Dalaran. 
Talk to Archmage Pentarus when you're ready to leave for Sholazar Basin. When you arrive, speak with Monte Muzzleshot in the Wildgrowth Mangal of Sholazar Basin.	Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary?	When I heard that the legendary Hemet Nesingwary was setting sail for the Sholazar Basin, I offered to help fund his expedition. We know little of Sholazar, but it's said to be a lush paradise in the midst of this frozen continent. Hemet has agreed to send back samples of exotic plants, reagents, and crystals. There hasn't been any word from him. Monte Muzzleshot was supposed to be bringing them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either. If you'll look into it, I'll send you in my flying machine. 
Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault has asked you to collect a Cultist Rod, an Abomination Hook, a Geist Rope, and 5 Scourge Essences.	I Have an Idea, But First...	When I was in the - ahem - employ of the Lich King, we would often use a device known as a sovereign rod to keep some of the more intelligent Scourge in line. I require that you assist me in the construction of a new one. Luckily for you, all of the necessary components are at hand: a cultist rod, an abomination hook, a geist rope, and a handful of Scourge essences. This should not be difficult, Mechanic. 
Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to bring him the Horn of the Ancient Mariner.	Horn of the Ancient Mariner	A Kvaldir lieutenant known as Orabus directed the initial incursion against my people at Pal'ea, He oversaw the destruction of both villages and then disappeared into the mist. In those early days there was talk of a horn that Orabus gifted to the Kvaldir mistweavers. This horn could be used to summon him should the need arise. We need to get that horn from the Kvaldir mistweavers and call forth Orabus. If he is destroyed, these savages might retreat. Seek out mistweavers at Pal'ea, to the south. 
Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Ring and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the Glittering Strand. Then, return to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.	The Focus on the Beach	The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it. No doubt the captain of the force down there will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus. With any skill on your part, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there. 
Bring the SCRAP-E Access Card along with 4 Handfuls of Cobalt Bolts and 5 Overcharged Capacitors to SCRAP-E at The Inventor's Library.	SCRAP-E	This card allows the user to access the control panel of the scrapbot designated SCRAP-E, in order to perform maintenance and reprogram the bot's directives. SCRAP-E appears to be assigned to the interior of the building at The Inventor's Library. The card displays a list of the bot's broken components and failing systems. With the proper parts, the bot can be restored to working condition. 
Chromie, at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, has asked you to travel to the Bronze Dragonshrine. Once inside, place the Hourglass of Eternity on the ground. Protect the hourglass for as long as it lasts and then return to her with whatever information you gain.	Mystery of the Infinite	A time storm at the Bronze Dragonshrine to the northeast is keeping immortals from entering. The Infinite Dragonflight are in a fight inside with the defenders to wrest control of the dragonshrine. We must take this opportunity to gain information. You are not immortal. You can cross into the dragonshrine and use the Hourglass of Eternity. Protect the hourglass for long enough and the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight should be revealed. Be warned, the Infinite Dragonflight will try to stop you! 
Vereth on the Rise of Suffering has dispatched you to kill Orbaz Bloodbane.	The Fate of Bloodbane	With the riders of the Host of Suffering dead, now is the time to put an end to their true leader: Orbaz Bloodbane. Mograine caught up with me while you were off and told me that he found where Orbaz is hiding. Under Icecrown Citadel itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside its lip. Some of the Ebon Blade's strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die. 
Weslex Quickwrench at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to bring him a Flying Machine Engine.	Need an Engine, Take an Engine	She's ruined... ruined! I told that captain to be careful with such a precious cargo, but would she listen to me? No! When the ship ran aground, it damaged my flying machine, the Spirit of Gnomeregan. Now, we're left without any means to send our reports! There is a chance, though, that the Venture Company's antics may work in our favor. They shot down another flying machine right about where Monte parachuted into the swamp to the east. Go there and retrieve the engine. It may be our only hope. 
Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings.	The Black Knight of Westfall?	No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to be descended from the Cooper family of Westfall. Would you visit their residence in the western part of Moonbrook in Westfall? See if you can find any proof of his story. 
Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy in the Howling Fjord has asked that you recover 5 Barrels of Blasting Powder from the ship's hold.	Mutiny on the Mercy	Aye, we got problems, matey.

First time use one of these things; plus, Chief Rageclaw is wolvar, not person. 
Chromie, at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, has asked you to travel once more to the Bronze Dragonshrine. Once inside, place the Hourglass of Eternity on the ground and help your Past Self to protect it from the forces of the Infinite Dragonflight.	Mystery of the Infinite, Redux	There you are! Or, were we just talking?<Chromie muses over the temporal possibilities.>Anyway, the Infinites are after you! Well, not you per-se. Rather, they're after the past version of you that defended the Hourglass of Eternity. You remember, right? That was you back then, except it's you now too. Wait, that's not important. What is important is that you head back to the Bronze Dragonshrine and defend yourself and the hourglass from their attacks before you get erased from history!

The Flesh Giant Champion	You've done well in destroying the Fleshwerks and slaughtering the Lich King's servants.

It will not be an easy fight, but the Shadow Vault has dispatched Margrave Dhakar with some reinforcements. Meet up with him at the highest point at the western end of the Fleshwerks. Tell him when you're ready to begin the attack and he'll order his forces into battle.

Recover the Frozen Heart of Isuldof and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.	The Frozen Heart of Isuldof	Some say Jonah was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins... It was then that the madness truly took over. He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late...I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here! 
Slay Great Mua'kin and return to the Glimmerfin Oracle.	Guardian of the Smallest	<The oracle pats you on the shoulder, and seems quite pleased with all that you've done. She holds up one finger, then spreads her hands wide and emits a terrible roar-like murgle. She points outside, then at you, then your weapon, then nods seriously. There must be one more trial to await you. It would appear to be a test of strength.> 
Thorim wants you to listen to his story.	Sibling Rivalry	Sif? Is it truly you? No? A Human? But for a moment....Enough of this! The visions of my Sif have tormented me for far too long. It is time for me to avenge her, and to bring honor to her memory. My brother must pay!

Keristrasza has asked you to collect 10 Crystalized Mana Shards from around Coldarra. If you lose your Augmented Arcane Prison, speak to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield.	Bait and Switch	During my captivity I was able to learn much about Malygos. Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him. There is a great blue dragon, Saragosa, who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort. If any serious threats arise, she alerts her master of the danger. I suffered greatly at the hand of Saragosa during my captivity, and now her time to die has come. First, however, we must fashion the perfect bait.... 
Elder Muahit wants you to kill Heigarr the Horrible in Njord's Breath Bay.	The Tides Turn	The spirits have heard our cry for help, George. It's a sign that Kaskala might yet be saved.

Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Arcanist Tybalin.	An Audience With The Arcanist	I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Silver Enclave's defenses for a short period of time.

While disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest, and return the book to me. 
Speak with Penumbrius at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.	If There Are Survivors...	Across the Valley of Echoes, west of here, and through the Breach, is the first Scourge encampment in Icecrown known as Scourgeholme. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown. If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the bronze dragonflight and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance. 
Deliver Father Gustav's Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.	Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend	Silas and Spitzpatrick have signed off on the materials and fuel needed to begin construction of Justice Keep.

Annie Bonn at Scalawag Point wants you to bring her Jonah Sterling's Spyglass.	The Jig is Up	I know why you're here, George. You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling. I'd like to offer my help. Jonah's leadership threatens our operation. Attacking the Horde and the Alliance fleets simultaneously? Suicidal. Trying to sell the tuskarr as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate? Disastrous. Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here. Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed and my first action as leader will be to end all attacks against your allies.

Archmage Berinand at the Transitus Shield has asked you to collect the readings from his instruments in Coldarra.	Reading the Meters	I had hoped that the Nexus' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over Azeroth suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially! I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution. I've placed sensitive instruments around Coldarra, disguised as Malygos' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings.

You kill one and another comes... screaming louder and with a bigger weapon than the one before. Only thing that makes vrykuls afraid is when we kill the biggest and baddest vrykul of all. Go fight the Winterskorn across the blockade until hero vrykuls show up! Then you kill them dead and put queen's flag on corpses. They must learn to fear! 
Interact with the Prototype Console in The Inventor's Library.	The Scrapbot Construction Kit	Searching the databanks of the prototype console reveals schematics for a scrapbot construction kit.

Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Kor'kron Suppression Turret to keep the Kor'kron Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops.	Assault by Air	Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste. A unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on Orgrim's Hammer whip us up a suppression turret. You're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece.

A Victory For The Sunreavers	At last, Quel'Delar is restored for the glory of the Sunreavers and the sin'dorei! All of Silvermoon will celebrate you as a hero, George. As a Mechanic, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? No worthy sin'dorei has come forward. Let us seek the Argent Crusade's counsel. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Sunreavers. 
Vaelen the Flayed at Ufrang's Hall has asked you to retrieve the Key to Vaelen's Chains.	Get the Key	Mechanic, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of Instructor Hroegar outside. Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders? 
Deliver Farseer Grimwalker's Remains, which are resting below his spirit, to Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.	Return My Remains	George, now that my spirit has been freed would you do me the honor of returning my remains to Spirit Talker Snarlfang? They lay upon the ground beneath me.

Thorim wants you to talk to King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem and discover what he knows of Krolmir.	Krolmir, Hammer of Storms	One task remains before I can reclaim my home at the Terrace of the Makers. Krolmir must be found. On that fateful day, I threw it to the earth with all the power and rage I possessed. A mighty explosion followed. I've thought it lost for these many years, but now I must be certain. Return to King Jokkum and discover what, if anything, he knows of my hammer's fate. 
Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings.	The Black Knight of Silverpine?	No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to hail from Valgan's Field in Silverpine Forest. It's a small farm on the western shore of Lordamere Lake. Would you visit the farm and let me know if there's any truth to his story? 
Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran wants you to use the Teleport to Violet Stand Crystal and the Teleport to Dalaran Crystal.	Learning to Leave and Return: the Magical Way	Just in case you don't already know, you can use the crystal on the platform behind me to teleport to the Violet Stand in Crystalsong Forest beneath Dalaran.

Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. Use the Vials of Frost Oil to destroy 30 Plagued Proto-Drake Eggs.	The Aberrations Must Die	It is not enough to demonstrate your prowess among your peers. You must also fight our enemies, dear sister. The Valkyrion traitors continue to mock our noble drake-riding traditions by rearing plagued proto-drakes. Seize the frost oil they wield and use it to freeze their abominable plagued eggs. 
Destroy 30 Wastes Scavengers and recover the Scythe of Antiok. Return to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple should you complete this task.	On Ruby Wings	Use this beacon to signal a Wyrmrest vanquisher. Climb upon its back and fly north to Galakrond's Rest. Once there, command the dragon to destroy the Scourge scavengers that work to unearth Galakrond. Once the area has been cleansed, fly to the Wicked Coil, overlooking Galakrond's Rest, to destroy Grand Necrolord Antiok and recover the scythe that he uses to control the wyrms. Do this and return to Queen Alexstrasza for a hero's reward! George, beware the rotting storm giants that wander the area! 
Go to Death's Stand and ride Dusk to the location of Tanathal's Phylactery. Obtain it and bring it back to Thassarian inside the Wailing Ziggurat.	Finding the Phylactery	No time for small talk, George. I was sent on what was to be a suicide mission to take this ziggurat. I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers. This lich has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge. The lich stored his soul in a phylactery, and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him. Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery. Bring it to me. 
Rescue 5 Helpless Wintergarde Villagers and return to Gryphon Commander Urik at Wintergarde Keep.	Flight of the Wintergarde Defender	With this whistle you can call down a Wintergarde gryphon. Mount the creature and head towards the ruins of Wintergarde Village, now known as the Carrion Fields, southeast of here. Once at the fields, keep your eyes peeled for helpless Wintergarde villagers. When you spot one, fly low and use the gryphon to pick them up. Return the rescued villager here, to the gryphon station. There are Scourge all over the place so you'll need to keep your wits about you, hero. Good luck! 
Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Glossgleam.	A Suitable Disguise	Getting you inside the Sunreaver's Sanctuary will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Sunreaver tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work. On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while. 
Look into the Eye of Eternity at the Nether Vortex in the Nexus. Meet Tarecgosa inside the Nexus where she will escort you to the rift.	Through a Glass, Darkly	<Tarecgosa listens as you explain your presence in Coldarra.>Your tale rings true, Mechanic. Much has changed since the death of Malygos - little of it for the better. I know of the device you carry, and I recognize Anachronos' magic in its creation. There is but one place in all of Coldarra that would allow this Timeless Eye to be used discreetly. You will require my assistance if you hope to succeed. Speak with me again inside the Nexus and you shall have it. 
Look for a Golden Engagement Ring on the various creatures in Sholazar Basin.	It Could Be Anywhere!	When I found out that Miss Boulian was helping Nesingwary with his expedition, I signed up as a deckhand immediately. You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months! I had it all planned out. I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone. I've searched everywhere! I know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin. If some Venture Company didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it. But it's here somewhere... I just know it! 
Use the Lorehammer to travel back in time and face the North Wind as Stormhoof. When Stormhoof falls and drops the Horn of Elemental Fury, use it to finish off the North Wind, and then return to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.	Changing the Wind's Course	At last, we have all that we need to right the wrongs of the North Wind and its followers. You have attuned the Lorehammer to Stormhoof's time and his persona. Take the hammer again, head to the Temple of Life in the plains to the northwest. Use the hammer to assume the role of Stormhoof. Face the North Wind as Stormhoof, but realize that for the timeline to be restored, Stormhoof must die as the North Wind weakens. Then, you must find and use the Horn of Elemental Fury to destroy the North Wind. 
Thassarian on the Skybreaker wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a Reanimated Abomination, which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.	That's Abominable!	Abominations...They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends. They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question. Fortunately for you, I know these secrets. This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the Scourge on the death gate. 
Speak to Brijana outside Brunnhildar Village.	You'll Need a Bear	You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet. To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own. Unfortunately, the Hyldnir don't give them out to just anyone. You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat. The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the Sons of Hodir, Thorim's former allies. Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process. 
Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight wants you to use Orik's Crystalline Orb in the ruins located at the Forgotten Shore to redeem the Forgotten.	The Truth Shall Set Us Free	Zelig gave this crystal ball to me years ago with specific instruction on its use. For five years - whenever I would feel anger, anxiety, or sorrow over the events that transpired here - I was to focus my thoughts upon the orb. I now understand why Zelig gave this crystal to me. Take my crystalline orb to the Forgotten Shore. Find the ruins of my old base on the upper reaches of the beach and place the orb in the center of town. Let the forgotten see the world through my heart and soul. 
Slay Gammothra and return the Head of Gammothra to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.	Gammothra the Tormentor	Magnataur live in prides, much like lions: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. In the case of Gammoth, the magnataur den west of here, Gammothra is the leader. It is Gammothra that controls this magnataur population and therefore it is Gammothra that must be slain to prevent any type of magnataur uprising. Take this pouch of crushed bloodspore flower to Gammoth. Use the powder from the pouch to weaken Gammothra and then slay him! Return his head to me as proof. 
Etaruk, camped near the entrance to the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill 12 Beryl Treasure Hunters.	Reclaiming the Quarry	You're a welcome sight, Mechanic. My name is Etaruk, and I used to be a craftsman here at the Coldrock Quarry. My companions and I were preparing a new set of statues for their last set of rites when we saw those mysterious blue platforms come flying over the plateau. When they landed, the mages they carried swarmed the quarry, murdering my fellows and plundering the quarry. If we don't stop them, they'll destroy our statues and make off with our artifacts. Will you help me defeat the invaders? 
Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle has requested that you locate the hero, Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil, in northeast Icecrown. His fire pit will likely be the most obvious indication of his location from the air.	A Tale of Valor	Perhaps you've heard the praises for our missing hero? Crusader Bridenbrad was in the Broken Front aiding the attack against the Scourge when the undead army came down upon them. The many men of that allied force scattered, but Bridenbrad alone returned and dragged more than a dozen men to safety, one by one through the carnage. Mechanic, he has not returned since. He was spotted heading to the far northeast, towards the Silent Vigil. Bring him back to me that I might honor him for his valor. 
Thassarian at the Wailing Ziggurat wants you to go to the Temple City of En'kilah and retrieve High Priest Talet-Kha's Scroll from the Spire of Pain, High Priest Naferset's Scroll from the Spire of Decay and High Priest Andorath's Scroll at the Spire of Blood.	Words of Power	The lich has spoken, George. The high priests of En'kilah hold the secret to entering Naxxanar. Go to the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain and the Spire of Decay and slay each of the priests. Return once you've obtained the three scrolls. 
Enter the Ice Heart Cavern and slay Rattlebore. If it is still in your possession, be sure to use Zort's Protective Elixir to protect you from the Jormungar's corrosive spit. Return to Ko'char the Unbreakable in the Crystal Vice when the task is complete.	Really Big Worm	The jormungar have a spawnmother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the Plaguelands. I saw her only briefly as I was fighting off their initial onslaught - she is large enough to devour one of my young whole. This cavern will not be ours until she is removed from it. 
Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to collect the Sacred Drakkari Offering from the Drakil'jin Ruins and use the Drakkari Spirit Dust on it. You must use the Infused Drakkari Offering at the gongs outside of Drakil'jin Ruins.	Jin'arrak's End	It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it. While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done. A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering. The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls. May the spirits guide your actions, George. 
Kill Master Summoner Zarod and use his Summoning Stave to destroy the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Summoning Altars. When you've completed this task, report to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.	Destroying the Altars	So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars? They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar. Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed. 
Matthias Lehner in the Court of Bones wants you to look for a Bloodstained Stone and complete the Prince's Destiny.	The Hunter and the Prince	Before the prince became a king, he fought many battles... but only one where he came close to dying. It was fought right here.

Gan'jo wants you to collect the Snow of Eternal Slumber from his chest in the Drakil'jin Ruins.

Sabotage	While we're working to discover the purpose of these crystals, we need you back in Voltarus doing Drakuru's bidding. Every task you perform successfully gets you closer to him, and brings us that much nearer to knowing his mind. While you're there, I have another mission for you. Drakuru's Scourgewagons pose a significant threat. We need them destroyed. Make your way to the wagons and activate these charges. Once they're set, get clear! The explosion will expose you if you're too close. 
Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis.	Need More Info	The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time....Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details. 
Report to Wind Master To'bor at Warsong Hold.	Wind Master To'bor	You're a tough mother, George. I think your talents are better suited elsewhere - like the root of the whole damn problem!<Razgor points to the west.>A thousand Scourge, at least four full sized floating death machines and who knows what else. But you're gonna find out and then you're gonna handle it... That's right, you're gonna beat the hell out of the Scourge army that's currently beating down our door. Get to the top of Warsong Hold and report to Wind Master To'bor. He'll be expecting you. 
Retrieve Kaganishu's Fetish and use it upon Farseer Grimwalker's Remains. You will need to give the fetish to Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit inside of Magmoth.	Kaganishu	After my small force of grunts were killed, I was dragged down here and ritually murdered. The snobold who did this is known as Kaganishu. Though you have vanquished his shaman helpers, my spirit is still tethered to this place. After he slew me, he created a fetish from my body, which anchors me here. Kaganishu is using it to learn all that I know of shamanism. You must retrieve the fetish from him and use it upon my spirit. Kaganishu is nearby in the caves. Only then will I truly be free.

Report to Garrosh Hellscream at Warsong Hold should you succeed.	The Plains of Nasam	Once you're ready, jump into one of the tanks and drive it out to the Plains of Nasam, southeast of here. Use the tank's weapon arsenal to take down the Scourge army. If you get in a jam, the ""Meatpounder"" will tear 'em up and the land mines will finish 'em off! If you find any of our soldiers, grab 'em! One last thing, fuel tanks can be found all over the field. Try to get close enough to that structure in the center and see what's going on. If you do all of this and live, go to Hellscream! 
Obtain a Tainted Crystal from the wolvar near Sparktouched Haven and bring it to the Great Lightning Stone to call Soo-holu.

Puppy-men down there have bad crystals for making trouble... bring a bad crystal to Lightning Shrine so Soo-holu know to help. Don't be scared if Soo-holu take your body... he very powerful, so he keep you safe. 
Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering has requested that you bring a subdued Lithe Stalker to the top of the rocks northeast of the Rise of Suffering.	New Recruit	First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with Arthas, and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get... with a little prodding from an eye of dominion. Fly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me. 
Glorthal in Frosthold has requested a search of the Bor's Breath valley and Bor's Fall for any sign of the missing Frostborn Scouts.	Missing Scouts	There is something that I could use a hand with now that I have you. We have a few scouts that are extremely late in returning. The peaks are harsh... but these boys know what they're doing. Head to the east... along the Bor's Breath valley and near Bor's Fall... they should be out that direction. If you find any sign of one of them, bring me back news immediately. We have a few enemies in the area - if any of them are getting a bit uppity, the more warning the better. 
Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Amulet and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the Lothalor Woodlands. Then, return to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.	Atop the Woodlands	I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though. My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the south. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own. Be quick about your business, Mechanic. I feel that time may be running out. 
Njormeld wants you to fly to the tip of the northern ice spike in Dun Niffelem and use the Tablets of Pronouncement.	Placing Hodir's Helm	The helm is forged. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, small one. Though there remains much to do, we sons of Hodir are grateful for your accomplishments. In return, I offer you the opportunity to present Hodir's helm to our king and our brethren. Fly to the sparkling tip of the small ice spike in front of me and read to our people from this tablet. Enjoy the privilege, Mechanic. Never before has an outsider been given such an honor! 
Report to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise in Icecrown.	To the Rise with all Due Haste!	Some would say that our most critical mission lies not with the Lich King, but with the utter destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught. I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge? Death's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself.<The baron clears his throat.>Do see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally. 
Drakuru wants you to get 5 Frozen Mojo from the Drakkari Trolls at the Ruins of Drak'Zin and then use the elixir at Drakuru's Brazier there.	Subject to Interpretation	A legendary set of artifacts, lost for thousands of years, were created to make Drak'Tharon Keep impervious. Most think they be myth, but Drakuru knows better, mon! I nearly discovered where one be, but got captured while interpreting hieroglyphs. Ya gotta summon my soul back dere so I can finish readin' em! Use my elixir at da brazier on Drak'Zin Ruins, southwest of here. You'll hafta mix in da frozen mojo my bruddas be holdin'. I hate ta see my bruddas fall, but it be for the greater good. 
Speak to Rodney Wells at Wintergarde Keep to secure a ride to Stars' Rest in western Dragonblight.	A Disturbance In The West	Another force threatens to destroy all that we have worked for, George. You must head westward to Stars' Rest. Archmage Modera has sensed a great disturbance in the magical ley lines of our world that must be dealt with immediately! Go now, George! Speak to Rodney Wells at the gryphon station here in Wintergarde and let him know the nature of your mission. He will place you on his fastest gryphon to deliver you to Stars' Rest. Speak with Archmage Modera when you arrive. 
Recover the Heart of the Mists and bring it and the Kvaldir Attack Plans to Justicar Mariel Trueheart at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	Battle Plans Of The Kvaldir	Looking over the captured attack plans, you find a map of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor with major settlements marked. Reading over the orders, you learn that Kvaldir captains have drafted plans for a series of devastating raids. According to the orders, the attacks are to begin after Mistcaller Yngvar ""consults the Heart of the Mists."" Perhaps you could delay the attacks by capturing the omen from the Mistcaller's Cave on the western side of Hrothgar's Landing and notify Justicar Mariel Trueheart. 
Aid Captain Iskandar in holding the canyons by participating in the death of 12 Frigid Ghoul Attackers, 8 Frigid Geist Attackers, and 1 Frigid Abomination Attacker. Return to Ceristrasz once you have finished this task.	Heated Battle	The Scourge have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, Dahlia Suntouch, is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms. The situation is dire, Human. Captain Iskandar leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine. Go to his aid... but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons. 
Elder Muahit at Njord's Breath Bay wants you to find Iruk's corpse in the water and retrieve Issliruk's totem.	Spirits Watch Over Us	Powerful spirits watch over my tribe -- Kaskala will not be lost. Issliruk will give us courage, Tayutka will make sure our survivors always have food and shelter and Karkut will watch over the fallen so they do not lose their way. Issliruk's guidance is the one we need the most right now. I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the Kvaldir's spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north. Bring me the totem, George. Don't let my nephew's death be in vain. 
Explorer Abigail has asked you to /raise your hand at 10 Abandoned Pack Mules and then return to her at Westguard Keep.	Send Them Packing	I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered. That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules! If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure. 
Lord-Commander Arete wants you to deal with Grand Admiral Westwind. Return to the lord-commander upon Death's Rise after you have done so.	The Admiral Revealed	When High General Abbendis was confronted at New Hearthglen, the grand admiral protected himself within an impenetrable sphere of magic before making his escape. I am particularly adept at nullifying magic. Take this to use against him inside The Hidden Hollow when he puts the sphere up. I wish that I could be there to see the look on his face when you do it. Deal with him. 
Bring a Seer's Crystal to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Seer's Crystal	Now that we know there's no truth to the Black Knight's stories, we must find a way to connect him to the murdered knights. I know a way to reveal the truth about how they died, but it requires a rare material. We must gain a seer's crystal, found only among the unbound seers who congregate near night elf ruins in the Forlorn Woods in the central part of Crystalsong Forest. Find one of these seers, George, and bring me the crystal it holds. 
Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to travel to Uldis and try to prevent Overseer Narvir from obtaining the Heart of the Storm.	The Heart of the Storm	According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm. Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus! Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River. 
General Gorlok at the lighthouse in Venture Bay wants you to destroy the Alliance Lumber Boat. General Gorlok will only be present at the lighthouse when the Horde has it in their possession.	Riding the Red Rocket	You there, Human! Get your lousy carcass over here! The Alliance have a shipment of lumber all ready for transport just northeast of here. Since getting our hands on that wood is out of the question, there's only one thing to do - destroy it! The goblin at the end of the dock here has some torpedoes all ready to go. He's got all the fuel for them on the docked goblin ship to the north. Get some fuel, then commandeer one of the torpedoes and ride it into their ship. Dismissed! 
Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to use Nass to collect 10 hair samples from Withered Trolls. If you lose Nass, return to Stefan to recover him.	Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes	Before you meet Nass, there's something you should know. He got a toxic dose of blight back in the day, and now he's deaf, blind, and mostly numb. It's not all bad, though. He's virtually immune to the stuff now, which makes him perfect for certain tasks - like the one I'm about to give you. There are many freshly scourged trolls nearby and we need to study the blight's effect on them. Take Nass, and this boot. When you've slain a troll, give him a good kick and he'll know to take a hair sample. 
Overlord Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to use the Scepter of Suggestion on the Blight Geists and then order them to harvest 7 Blight Crystals.	It Rolls Downhill	If ya ever gonna be worthy of da Lich King's gifts, ya must learn ta be a great leader - one who be commandin' respect! I got a task dat gonna refine your command skills, mon....Summa my minions be trained ta harvest blight crystals from da land below, but dey be lazy and slow. You gonna be in charge o' dem, mon. Take dis scepter and teach 'em how to get da job done. When dey be under your control, make 'em harvest dem crystals! 
Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to destroy the Dragonflayer Longhouse, Dragonflayer Dockhouse, Dragonflayer Storage Facility and 8 Dragonflayer Defenders. Return the Harpoon Control Mechanism to him once the task is complete.	It Goes to 11...	We must strike while the vrykul forces are in disarray! Take the harpoon control mechanism to Nifflevar and locate the northernmost harpoon building on the bluff side of the village. Once there, commandeer one of the vrykul harpoon guns that are stationed on the building's deck. Use the harpoon gun to rain hell upon Wyrmskull Village! Destroy the longhouse, dockhouse, storage facility and any defenders that the vrykul may send at you! Do this and Daggercap Bay will become a much safer port! 
Speak with Saurfang the Younger at the Kor'kron Vanguard and tell him of your victory over the Scourge.	Return To Angrathar	With Antiok slain and the scythe in our possession, the frost wyrm assaults upon your forces at Angrathar will halt. The wyrms that remain in the Dragonblight will be hunted and destroyed, their bones returning to the earth. The time to make your final stand is now, George. Return to the Kor'kron Vanguard and notify Saurfang the Younger. 
Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Harold Lane.	The Assassination of Harold Lane	You have done much for the animals of the Borean Tundra, George. Nesingwary's lackeys have been beaten back and taught a lesson that they will not soon forget. Harold Lane, the primary agent responsible for the mass slaughters in Nagrand, has been identified as the man in charge of Nesingwary operations in the tundra. He is stationed at Lake Kum'uya, west of here.<Lathorius hands you an intricately carved oak horn.>Find Lane and kill him. Use this horn should you require our aid. 
Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold.	The Defense of Warsong Hold	It seems that we always meet in the direst of circumstances, Scarab Lord. Were you not saving the world from certain destruction the last time we met?<Saurfang chuckles.>Your assistance is most welcome in Northrend, despite what the young chieftain might say. If we had even a dozen more soldiers with your power, we would be sitting in Orgrimmar right now, hunched over a warm fire. Report to Overlord Razgor, right outside the main entry to Warsong Hold, to the south. 
Offer a sample of Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Hemet Nesingwary, Hadrius Harlowe, and Tamara Wobblesprocket, then return to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	The Taste Test	And now for the moment of truth!<Grimbooze chuckles.>I've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle. Instead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste. 
Speak with Garrosh Hellscream in Warsong Hold.	Hellscream's Vigil	Throm-Ka, Human! Welcome to Warsong Hold. My heart swells with pride to see that such a distinguished hero of the Horde has answered the call of duty! This impregnable fortress is a testament to the tenacity of the Horde. Through much we have battled to establish this foothold in Northrend. It is from here that our journey to Icecrown begins and it is through the leadership of the son of Hellscream that we will succeed! Garrosh awaits your arrival below. Lok'tar ogar! 
Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect 5 Dark Matters and summon a Dark Messenger at Aldur'thar.	Not a Bug	The cultists have discovered the last messenger you summoned, Human. While it was quite informative, it's important that we continue to monitor the cult's every move. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of enslaved minions at Aldur'thar. Then use their summoning crystal to bring another dark messenger into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy. 
Escort the Injured Rainspeaker Oracle to Rainspeaker Canopy and speak to High-Oracle Soo-say.	Fortunate Misunderstandings	I sorry! I not mean to get you in trouble!<The injured oracle stares at you blankly for a long while.>You save me! We thank you. We going to go back to village now. You come too... you can stay with us! Puppy-men kind of mean anyway. Let me know when you ready to go, okay? 
Lorekeeper Randvir in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 3 Everfrost Shards from the depths of Hibernal Cavern and 3 Stoic Mammoth Hides from the Stoic Mammoths in the Valley of Ancient Winters.	Forging Hodir's Spear	The time has come, little Mechanic. The stars have foretold of this day. I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact. We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow. I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking. Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern. 
Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through the southern pass and search for Ruby Acorns. Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen red dragons to return their bodies to the earth. Return to Vargastrasz once the task is complete.	Return to the Earth	I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks. Get into the shrine through the pass in the south... the Scourge presence should be lighter there. Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind. 
Ride the captive crocolisk to Mistwhisper Refuge and then speak to Zepik for further instructions. If you lose Zepik's Hunting Horn, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	A Rough Ride	Zepik is best hunter of the Frenzyheart. Zepik hunts big-tongues... ugly things near swamps that try to steal all stuff they can find. Zepik going on long trek to break big-tongue shrine and try to scare them away. We no want big-tongues in this land anymore. There a crocolisk chained on northeast side of hill, next to tree - go with Zepik and do what Zepik tell you. 
Etaruk, outside the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to destroy the North Platform, the East Platform, and the West Platform.	Hampering Their Escape	I'm sure you've seen those blue and white platforms hovering over the quarry. They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues. We must stop them before they leave the quarry. The small creatures digging in the quarry carry explosives. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward. 
The Bone Witch at Njorndar Village wants you to return with Iskalder.	Find the Ancient Hero	Quickly, George, head southwest to the Halls of the Ancestors! Within you will find slumbering mjordin. Wake them until you find Iskalder. When you do, use this amulet upon him and bring him back to me. Now go. There is no time to waste! 
Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel.	Opportunity	We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel. An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally. The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground. We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the Scourge. Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site. 
Use the large Vrykul Harpoon Gun in Nifflevar to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory over the Vrykul to Guard Captain Zorek.	Let's Go Surfing Now	Navigating the steep bluffs of Howling Fjord can be nerve-racking! I've come up with a solution to ease that burden by utilizing vrykul technology and dwarven ingenuity. With just a few adjustments and some fine tuning I've created Icehammer's harpoon controller! Of course it hasn't been tested, but that's what you're here for! Take the controller to the big gun in Nifflevar and use it to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory to Zorek. Oh yea, you can keep the controller. 
Get close to and observe the projection atop the Surge Needle floating above Moonrest Gardens. Afterward, return to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer with the information.	Projections and Plans	This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above the Moonrest Gardens to the southwest. George, I need you to use it to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off. I expect that once you teleport up to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe. You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens. 
Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to find Tur Ragepaw near Ursoc's Den and defeat Ursoc with his help. Use the Purified Ashes of Vordrassil on Ursoc's Corpse when you've accomplished this.	Ursoc, the Bear God	It is time, George. Take these ashes and look for the furbolg that Kodian spoke of. If he went to seek Ursoc, he will be near his den, north of Grizzlemaw. You will need his help. You won't be able to defeat Ursoc alone. Once you've defeated Ursoc, use these ashes to purify his spirit. Only then will we know whether our efforts have been in vain or not. 
Librarian Normantis on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Neural Needler on the Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer until he reveals the location of Lady Evanor.	The Art of Persuasion	It is fortunate you're here, Human. You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these. You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information. Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once! I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful.... 
Go to the Avalanche in Sholazar Basin and use the Omega Rune to deploy Etymidian. Use him to slay 200 Scourge Minions, Bythius the Flesh-Shaper, Urgreth of the Thousand Tombs and Hailscorn. Speak to the Avatar of Freya in Sholazar Basin when you've completed this task.	Reclamation	It is time, George. The Etymidian is one of the most destructive forces ever created by the titans and I am loathe to unleash him in my lands. There is little choice, however. Our enemies have forced my hand and the fury of the titans will cleanse all. 
Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to return with 3 Lasher Seeds.	Seeds of the Lashers	We need more weapons in the fight against the Scourge. The natural properties of the Emerald Dragonshrine to the southeast may be the answer. Any unliving creature, save those that Sylvanas has redeemed, that steps foot in the dragonshrine falls to dust. I want to test a theory, and I want you to be my instrument in doing so, young Human. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and take the seeds from the emerald lashers therein. 
Battle a Hulking Jormungar east of Nozzlerust Post until it opens its mouth, then throw a Potent Explosive Charge into its throat. After it explodes, collect 6 slabs of Seared Jormungar Meat off of the ground and bring them back to Xink.	Hard to Swallow	Those troops are sure to be needin' a hefty supply of food in their bellies. I'll let you in on a little secret that a squeamish Human like you would never know... those jormungar worms taste just like chicken. Go provoke one of those giant hulking jormungar to the east. You're not likely to be able to kill one straight out, so just toss this down its throat when it opens its mouth wide. Bring me back as many of the slabs of meat as you can tote. 
King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to find Njormeld at Fjorn's Anvil.	You Can't Miss Him	<Jokkum listens patiently to your request, then ponders it carefully before responding.>So it is you we have to thank for Fjorn's demise? While it's true that you have aided us in our time of need, there is still much that must be done to repair our relations with Thorim. For now, I shall allow Njormeld to reforge the armor we gifted to the Stormlord so many ages ago. Consider it payment for your assistance against Fjorn. Njormeld was sent to recover Fjorn's anvil. You should find him there. 
Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.	The Thane of Voldrune	Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson. The thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane. Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy. 
Dr. Rogers at Drak'Sotra wants you to find Crusader Lamoof, Crusader Jonathan, and Crusader Josephine. Use the Crusader's Bandage on them, and escort them safely back to him.	Leave No One Behind	Ahh, good. They sent someone. Listen, Human. We need a hand here. Our forces were pushed back and we've lost Drak'Sotra to the Scourge. Where they came from is anyone's guess....The point is, we need every man we can get here, and some of our best have yet to return from battle. I need you to enter the ruins now that the fighting has died down and find our wounded, patch them up, and bring them here to me. Scour Drak'Sotra! They couldn't have gone far. 
Stefan wants you to use your Ensorcelled Choker to get into Voltarus and do whatever the Scourge leader there asks of you. If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Watch to get another.	Infiltrating Voltarus	By now you've probably guessed the details of my plan. We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty. Travel northeast to Reliquary of Pain and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commander. When you've completed your mission, blow this horn and I'll fly to your location to receive your report. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has sent you to banish 10 Scourge Containment Crystals.	From Whence They Came	My main concern is the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses. I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike ziggurats. Use the eidolon watcher to destroy any of those crystals that you find. 
Recover Olakin's Torso, Olakin's Legs, Olakin's Left Arm, and Olakin's Right Arm and bring them to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.	He's Gone to Pieces	With the abduction of Crusader Olakin, the Argent Crusade's forces will have no commander in the final assault on the Fleshwerks. While one crusader is the same as any other to me, the argents won't see it that way. I hate to see us waste time chasing after this, but I have no choice. Our gallant crusader has likely been dismembered by now, and his remains used to construct abominations. Go down into the Fleshwerks, kill the corpulent horrors fighting our forces, and recover Olakin's body parts. 
Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to take the teleporter to his upper chamber.	Disclosure	Ya doin' well, George. You be provin' dat I got an eye for talent! Now ya see why da Lich King gave me his blessing....Da time has come for me to reveal my master plan to ya, mon. Now you be seein' how we gunna sweep through da swarms of Drakkari trolls to take our rightful place in da great palace of Gundrak. Take dis scepter, mon. It be a token of my trust in ya. With it, you be able ta access my upper chamber and witness for yourself our secret weapons. 
Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to acquire the Key of Warlord Zol'Maz.	The Key of Warlord Zol'Maz	George, we need a key to unlock the chains of the rhino god, Akali. Even now he is being prepared for the slaughter. The Drakkari warlord, Zol'Maz, carries the key. Hearing of your exploits, he has secluded himself and his family at their stronghold up the steps to the northeast. The warlord is strong and you will need help. If you were to combine the tiki, sword and incantation of his family members, you would be able to summon such help as you challenge him before his home's gate. 
Ricket at K3 would like you to locate the Transporter Power Cell and use it to activate the Transportation Pad at Garm's Rise.	Cell Block Tango	The sapper squad is ready. That means it's time for fun! There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there. I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter. 
Take the Unliving Choker to Stefan at Ebon Watch.	An Invitation, of Sorts...	Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design. Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to Ebon Watch. If anyone can explain this, a death knight can.... 
Njormeld wants you to take the Reforged Armor to Thorim at the Temple of Storms.	A New Beginning	It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim. May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible. 
Anzim on Amber Ledge wants you to fly with his war mages to free Lady Evanor at Beryl Point. You are then to report to her in the mage tower on Amber Ledge.	Rescuing Evanor	At last, we attack! Once we've cleared the platform I'll use the key. You are to ensure that Lady Evanor remains safe after her release. Hurry now, let us be off! 
Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to slay Garhal.	Examples to be Made	For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister. In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection. The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal. Put an end to him... and make sure the other males see his demise. They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated. 
Take the Alliance Deserter to the crossroads east of Warsong Hold and fire your Warsong Flare Gun to signal the Alliance. Report to Scout Tungok once you have successfully delivered the Alliance Deserter to their destination.	Coward Delivery... Under 30 Minutes or it's Free	We're seeing more deserters show up at our gates with each passing day. We simply do not have enough room to keep all of these maggots caged up. Especially not if we want to keep the pigs happy.<Nork snorts as he laughs.>I want you to escort one of these cowards to the crossroads east of here and fire this flare gun. One of their captains will show up when they see the flare and take the coward off your hands. Report to Scout Tungok on the east road once the delivery has been made. 
Report to Crusader Valus at Light's Trust in Dragonblight.	The Call Of The Crusade	Mechanic! The Argent Crusade is looking for able bodied soldiers that are willing to set aside their differences and join forces to battle the forces of the Lich King. Will you take up our cause? Should you be interested, venture north to Light's Trust and speak with Crusader Valus. You will find Light's Trust amidst the ruins of the sacked troll city of Jintha'kalar - bordering Zul'Drak. Farewell. 
Recover Norgannon's Shell from Archivist Mechaton.	Norgannon's Shell	Charging inventor's disk. Disk charging completed. Preparing emergency protocol gamma. Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified. Please have a pleasant millennium. 
Speak with Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy.	The Lost Shield of the Aesirites	If you listen real close you can hear cannon fire coming from the northeast. That's Captain Ellis's ship, Sister Mercy. Thing is, Ellis and his entire crew were killed 'bout a month ago.<Harry nods.>Ghost ship...If it's info you be wantin' 'bout the shield, Ellis is the man to ask. Sister Mercy docks on the small island between here and Sorlof's Strand to pick up more souls for the ship's crew 'bout once every five minutes. There be no shortage of souls 'round these parts... 
Use the Frosthound Collar at the Abandoned Camp to track down whoever took Brann's possessions. When you recover them, use the communication device and speak to whoever you can contact.	Sniffing Out the Perpetrator	The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found? Okay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent. It should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself. 
Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post wants you to go to Bloodmoon Isle and slay Selas, Varlam, Goremaw and the Shade of Arugal.	Hour of the Worg	It is time, then, George. Arugal must be defeated. Get a couple of people you can trust and head for Bloodmoon Isle. It's just off the coast, east of here. We'll hit them fast. Take out Arugal's lieutenants -- I'll catch up with you when it's time to take out the monster himself. 
Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village wants you to defeat 6 Victorious Challengers.	Taking on All Challengers	Let's get you started. The good news is that by defeating Agnetta, you've earned yourself a spot in the next round of matches. The bad news is that all your opponents will also have defeated someone in the first round. Do not expect pushovers. 
Look for Veehja at the Shrine of Scales on Riplash Strand.	A Father's Words	There is someone who might shed light on this mystery, Human. It is rumored that the Kvaldir have kept a naga priestess alive at the temple on the west side of the shore. She will no doubt have great reason to resent her uninvited Kvaldir guests. Perhaps my father is expecting her to cooperate with you in some way. 
Bring 10 Jagged Shards to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch.	Jagged Shards	You pulled this jagged, dark brittle shard from the body of a ghoul. The metal blade lacks a smooth edge, suggesting it was forged by an unskilled hand, or was broken from a larger piece. You recall seeing similar shards embedded in the bodies of all the ghouls you've encountered at the Fleshwerks, leading you to wonder why their creators bothered to include the metal at all. Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls. 
Find and kill Bonesunder in or near the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine. Bring any evidence you find back to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple.	One of a Kind	Such a strange seal to see among magnataur... it suggests an unusual amount of organization. Magnataur rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other. I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement. I very much doubt that this horn is unique, I need you to prove me wrong. In the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine you will find Bonesunder. Go challenge him and bring me back any evidence you find that might confirm my concerns. 
Brijana wants you to go to Brunnhildar Village and speak with Astrid Bjornrittar.	Deemed Worthy	You have succeeded where many have failed, sister. Whether it be by strength and courage or mere luck remains to be seen. Go back to the village and seek out Astrid Bjornrittar. Tell her of your accomplishments. But be warned. She is not easily impressed. 
Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Wyrmskull Village while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Wyrmskull.	The Echo of Ymiron	The spirit world has fallen under the sway of the Lich King. Fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare now stand watch over the realm of the elements. I sense that these val'kyr are guarding a terrible secret. I am too old and weak to survive another journey. You must go in my place, George. Take this incense burner to Wyrmskull Village and use it to enter the spirit world. Find the large dwelling in the northeast! Avoid the val'kyr at all costs lest they make you a permanent fixture in their world. 
Speak with The Bone Witch within the cave at Njorndar Village.	The Bone Witch	You remember Lady Nightswood, don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion. The lady has gone into Jotunheim and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the vrykul from within. She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim. 
Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.	A Cold Front Approaches	The chill of death stirs in the west, threatening to freeze our hearts and souls to this wasteland and bind us to its dark master. We will stand and we will fight! The preparations have begun. Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the front gate for your assignment. 
Speak with Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.	To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!	Did you feel it?<Sauranok momentarily clutches his chest in confusion. His hand comes away trailing red-hot steam.>Something terrible has happened to my old friend, Farseer Grimwalker. I just sensed it. He had a pupil that he took with him when he went north. They were going to help the overlord establish an outpost on the edge of Sholazar Basin. Her name is Snarlfang. She is a spirit talker. Perhaps she will know what happened. Or, at least, she can help you to find out. 
Drakuru wants you to bring the Heart of the Ancients to him at Drak'atal Passage. You will need to collect 5 Desperate Mojo to use the elixir there.	My Heart is in Your Hands	<Drakuru's voice fills your mind.>Hey, mon! Dis eye of da prophets be great! I been usin' it to watch ya and I see ya got da heart now! Not bad....Now ya just gotta bring it to my brazier at Drak'atal Passage, a short walk east of ya. Ya must drink my elixir at da pedestal to summon me there. This time, ya need ta mix in some desperate mojo from the defenders there for it ta be workin'. 
Successfully complete the distillation process and bring the completed Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Still At It	Now that we've got the raw materials, I've had my assistant ready the still. He'll oversee the process, but I want you to help keep everything under control. You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong. Ingredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with ""Tipsy"" McManus when you're ready to start distilling. 
Vereth the Cunning wants you to use the Lithe Stalker's Iron Chain to drag Scourge Bombs to 4 Lumbering Atrocities inside Malykriss.	Generosity Abounds	We need to cause some disruption to bring those death knights away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations. Abominations are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them near some of the Scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able to light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on. 
Ataika wants you to slay 12 Kvaldir Raiders in Kaskala.	Not Without a Fight!	Kaskala is a sacred place for us, Human. Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of Tayutka herself. Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation. We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling. Fight alongside us, friend. Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future. 
Slay Gigantaur and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.	WANTED: Gigantaur	By decree of Overlord Agmar:Target: GigantaurCrime: Attacks upon the Horde; ""Bein' ugly""Status: AliveThe magnataur lord, Gigantaur, is wanted in relation to a number of attacks against Horde soldiers and installations in the Dragonblight. Gigantaur was last seen wandering the woods and roads south by southeast of Agmar's Hammer. Gigantaur should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer. 
Vile at The Shadow Vault wants you to steal a Njorndar Proto-Drake and use it to set fire to 8 vrykul buildings in the greater Jotunheim region. Balargarde Fortress, due to its nature, cannot be set ablaze.	Vile Like Fire!	Vile like fire! Vile like proto-drakes!<The abomination claps its hands excitedly.>Little George go to Jotunheim and steal a pretty proto-drake in Njorndar Village. Make proto-drake make pretty fires on Jotunheim buildings! 
Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.	Judgment Day Comes!	We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own. Divided we shall all fall! I implore you answer the call, <brother/sister>. The Argent Crusade accepts all that would volunteer to aid in the war effort. Highlord Tirion Fordring himself awaits you at the Argent Vanguard! Get upon your mount and fly to the southeastern reaches of Icecrown. It is there that you will find Lord Fordring and the soldiers of the Argent Crusade. Go now, Mechanic, for judgment day comes! 
Accompany Kalecgos to the blue dragon council. Speak to Kalecgos in Coldarra when ready.	Alignment	The time of choosing has arrived, George. While only members of the blue dragonflight may attend, Tarecgosa's binding makes your presence requisite. I must ask that you take on her form and vote on her behalf. Do not tarry. The moment of the eclipse draws near.... 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability to collect 15 sets of Iron Rune Data. Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.	Lightning Infused Relics	Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the language of the titans. Take the construct to Baelgun's Excavation Site, due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there! Get on the table when you're ready! 
Escort Lurgglbr to safety and then report to King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat with the good news.	Escape from the Winterfin Caverns	The lock on my cage doesn't look too solid, but I'm not foolish enough to try to leave without assistance. Will you help me safely get out of these caverns? There's no time to waste, Human. When you get back to the retreat, please let the king know that I'm okay. He's sure to give you a reward. 
Deliver the Note from the Grand Admiral to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise.	The Grand (Admiral's) Plan	At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion. The letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth. The lord-commander will want to see this! 
Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to get the Azure Codex from Inquisitor Caleras and collect 3 Shimmering Runes from his Coldarra Spellbinders.	Cracking the Code	I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me. Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them. Not far from here is a Kirin Tor traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation. Hurry, mortal. Malygos gains strength with every passing moment. 
Speak to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Crusader's Pinnacle.	Argent Aid	There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights. I always expected the story to be more... symbolic. We must warn others, but we must be discreet. As soon as the Lich King knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart -- we'll never get a chance like this again. The Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned before. The Ebon Blade operates too close to the Scourge. We have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his Argent Crusade. 
Travel to the Obsidian Dragonshrine Northwest of Wymrest and just West of the Wrath Gate. Locate Serinar inside of the shrine and offer him your aid.	The Obsidian Dragonshrine	The Scourge come. Korialstrasz calls upon his allies in a futile attempt to save their Ruby Dragonshrine, but it seems the good graces of the red flight don't extend to saving the shrines of the other flights. Surprised? I'm not. There is another of my brood who has left to clear our Obsidian Dragonshrine of the undead vermin that now infest it. All it would take to prove yourself more noble and righteous than Alexstrasza herself is a quick jaunt over there and a few swings of a blade. I'm amused. 
Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown.	The Boon of A'dal	I am pleased that you have come to me, George. I know of Crusader Bridenbrad, and of your travels in hope of saving him. Bridenbrad's valor has sparked remarkable selflessness in you, and this is a miracle unto itself. The Light will take care of its own. I will extend my blessing to Bridenbrad and he shall not endure the corruption of undeath. I shall return you to Dalaran, and you shall return to him. Know that I remain with you. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has requested a Weeping Quarry Document, a Weeping Quarry Ledger, a Weeping Quarry Map, and a Weeping Quarry Schedule.	Amidst the Confusion	Shutting down their operation is just half of the plan. The other important goal here is to find out where all that saronite is being sent. We know of a few places it's been ending up, but the amount they're pulling out suggests to me that there's a bigger project in the works. Once you're inside the quarry, get your hands on any of their documents that you can find. If you're assaulting the place with one of the gryphons, you can drop down from it as soon as the wetwork is done. 
Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga has asked you to retrieve the Treasure of Kutube'sa, the Treasure of Gawanil, and the Treasure of Chulo the Mad.	The Leaders at Jin'Alai	You thinkin' what Ahunae thinkin', mon? Some of the Drakkari trolls have gathered at the Pools of Jin'Alai to the southwest. We be needin' to draw out their leaders, and Ahunae knows just how you be doin' it, too! Go in there and kill those trolls. When you kill enough, their leaders show up. When they show up next to their totems, you make sure to be gettin' the treasure of Kutube'sa, Gawanil, and Chulo the Mad, mon. 
Escort the Taunka'le Evacuees across Transborea to Wartook Iceborn on the border of the Dragonblight.	Across Transborea	The path across Transborea, to the east, is the only way to reach the Dragonblight. Many perils await you as you make your journey across the tundra. Beware the Scourge and its influence upon the beasts of the land. Rumors have started to spread about our very own taunka brothers and sisters rising from the dead and attacking caravans on their way to the Dragonblight! Defend your caravan and get the evacuees to safety! Wartook Iceborn waits for you across the bridge leading into the Dragonblight. 
Retrieve 6 Stolen Moa'ki Goods from the wolvar. Return them to Elder Ko'nani at Moa'ki Harbor.	Let Nothing Go To Waste	The wolvar have always been our natural enemies. But the incursion of your peoples into the Great Dragonblight has forced them into a small space upon the glade to the north. Combined with the land's upheaval this morning, they have become even more aggressive than ever before. They have made several raids upon our goods... things that we'll need if we are to survive the trek from our home here. As a sign of good faith and friendship, retrieve our goods from the Snowfall Glade wolvar. 
Deliver the Orders From Drakuru to Stefan Vadu at Ebon Watch in Zul'Drak.	The Ebon Watch	West of here, across the ruined roads and structures, is the death knight encampment of Ebon Watch.<Crusader Lord Lantinga rolls up Drakuru's orders.>Take these orders and deliver them to Stefan Vadu. He is the death knight in command at Ebon Watch. Let him know that the Argent Crusade will deal with Prince Navarius. They'll have to handle Drakuru. Be careful, George. The way to Ebon Watch is teeming with Scourge. 
Crusader Lord Dalfors at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you kill 15 Forgotten Depths Nerubians.	Defending The Vanguard	We can't keep this pace up, <lad/lass>. Once the breach was blown, the floodgates opened up. The Scourge have been pourin' through ever since with no end in sight! We need every able bodied man and woman to help keep the tide of evil at bay. Get out there and do yer share, friend. Kill as many of those monsters as ye can! 
The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has tasked you with using the Eye of the Lich King to gain information.	Through the Eye	We must use the Lich King's tools against him if we are to decide our next step. Over the mountain to the southwest lies Kul'galar Keep. Within it reside the oracles of Jotunheim who receive orders from their master and scry upon others through the Eye of the Lich King. It is the eye that you must fight your way to. While it cannot be used to pierce the veil within Icecrown Citadel, you should be able to use it to discern something of value so that we will know how best to proceed. 
Ricket at K3 wants you to retrieve a U.D.E.D, use it to blow up a mammoth, and retrieve 8 Hearty Mammoth Meat.	Ample Inspiration	Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for gnoll taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be... edible? Let's get more creative. Tore's got an explosive dispenser north of town... not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea. Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby mammoths... most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back. 
Slay Tu'u'gwar and then return to Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor.	Meat on the Hook	The time has come my friend: Tu'u'gwar must be dealt with! I've prepped the meat so that the beast is sure to come once you bait the hook I have out in the water. Just follow the fishing line here down to it. Whatever you do, don't let Tu'u'gwar swallow you whole, George! 
Sergeant Gorth wants you to go to Baleheim and use Gorth's Torch to burn 1 Winterskorn Dwelling, 1 Winterskorn Watchtower, 1 Winterskorn Bridge and 1 Winterskorn Barracks.	Baleheim Must Burn!	Killing the Winterskorns maybe not enough. Maybe we burn their houses too! Uh... and their bridges. We should burn whole town to be safe! You take this torch. Go to Baleheim, to the west, and burn EVERYTHING! That teach them good. 
Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to recover his Scrying Orb.	Imprints on the Past	The memories of the past haunt this land, George. I hear the cries of the fallen echo across Northrend - calling to me. Arthas left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign. First, you must recover my scrying orb from the town hall, George. Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square. 
Speak to Captain Kendall below Icecrown Citadel.	Exploiting an Opening	I've got an interesting assignment for you, George. If you're up for a challenge, that is. We've been tipped off about an opening below Icecrown Citadel. Our engineers have studied the layout and have decided it's a structural weakness. We've sent some men there along with some ""borrowed"" saronite bombs. They're under Captain Kendall's command. With a little help we could deal a huge blow to the forces of the Scourge. What do you say, George? 
Temper the Reforged Quel'Delar in the Crucible of Souls.	Tempering The Blade	At last, the pieces of Quel'Delar are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything. Deep in Icecrown Citadel's Forge of Souls is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me in The Frozen Halls. 
""Silvermoon"" Harry at Scalawag Point wants you to recover his Sin'dorei Scrying Crystal from the orca, ""Scoodles.""	"""Scoodles"""	One of the first things Jonah Sterling did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, ""Scoodles"" the orca. No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful sin'dorei crystal from its stomach. Do this and we can get down to business. 
Bring the Omega Rune to the Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids in Sholazar Basin.	Back Through the Waygate	You speak the truth, Human. I can sense the very essence of Sholazar Basin begin to fray by the blight of undeath even as we speak. I've bound my being into the rune, Human. Deliver it to she who sent you here -- for only her power can grant me passage to her lands. 
Defeat Krenna in the Conquest Pit.	The Conquest Pit: Final Showdown	You must've really upset Krenna. She and Gorgonna have had a spat and you're wanted in the pit immediately. There are some wild rumors that it's a fight to the death! That would be bad news for you, but great news for our business venture! At any rate, you can't run away from fate... best get in there on the quick and get it over with. 
Ares the Oathbound in the Utgarde Catacombs wants you to recover the Sacred Artifact. This is a timed quest.	The Shining Light	<Ares gasps for air as he tries to speak.>I am an envoy of the Argent Crusade, charged with a sacred duty. Our forces were decimated in the Plaguelands. By the light of dawn, the artifact was cleansed and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption. There is still a chance... still time. The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead.<Ares' body glows with blinding light.>Light. Will. Protect. You. 
Speak with Rokhan to call down the frostwyrm, Sarathstra. Kill Sarathstra and deliver Sarathstra's Frozen Heart to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.	Sarathstra, Scourge of the North	Me hunters be dead or frozen, George. You still want to do dis? Just say da word and me call for da dragon once more. If ya kill it, take da beast's frozen heart back to Agmar's Hammer and present it to Gort. He sure to reward you good, mon. 
Obtain the Sunreaver Orders.	The Sunreaver Plan	One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Sunreaver agent buying reagents from a dealer in the Black Market area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on in the sewers, so that's a big indication they're planning something. Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of them. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first. 
Brijana at Brunnhildar Village wants you to mount Icefang and shoot 7 Frostworgs and 15 Frost Giants in the Valley of Ancient Winters.	Bearly Hanging On	The test awaits, woman! Do you have the heart of a warrior queen? Or that of a sniveling seamstress? One taste of war and you'll know the answer. You might lie to your mother, your sisters, and even yourself, but the battlefield always exposes one's true nature. When you've made your preparations, mount Icefang and ride into battle. From her back, you must rain down a shower of death upon our enemy. 
Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to collect ""Silvermoon"" Harry's Debt.	Gambling Debt	I heard you did a little work for Terry. I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts. See, pirates love to gamble. They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt. If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut. Let's start you out with an easy one. ""Silvermoon"" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive blood elf knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke. Get my gold. 
Crusade Engineer Spitzpatrick at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to retrieve 8 pieces of Crystallized Energy.	It Could Kill Us All	Southeast of here, at the eastern reaches of Crystalsong Forest, is an area known as the Unbound Thicket. Within that thicket creeps all manner of life. One thing all of the affected creatures of the thicket share in common is their affinity for magical energy. Each of them holds pure, crystallized energy. Enough to kill us all should it ever destabilize! Travel to the Unbound Thicket and kill its denizens for crystallized energy. We need fuel and they need to die. We call that a ""win-win."" 
Prigmon at Granite Springs wants you to bring a Mummified Troll Carcass to Mack Fearsen and place it in the fire.	Scourgekabob	Ugh. Wrappin' up these unfortunate trolls be makin' my heart ache, but not so much as my back! Help ol' Prigmon out and haul one of these carcasses over to Mack. If we don't burn 'em they be walkin' again in no time. 
Show the scale to King Mrgl-Mrgl in Borean Tundra.	Glimmerfin Scale	<A brightly-colored scale fell to the ground as the murloc ran off. It was unlike any other murloc you've seen in Northrend. Perhaps King Mrgl-Mrgl would know more about this new species?> 
Follow the path to the northwest to reach the camp that Monte mentioned.	Welcome to Sholazar Basin	So, where did you come from? I don't suppose that fool of an archmage sent you, too? You're lucky to be in one piece, <laddie/lass>! They nearly blew you up! The jungle here's a darned dangerous place, 'specially with the Venture Company about. Git you! Go see the boss... he'll sort you out. The camp's at the end of that path to the northwest. Now, git! 
Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to use the Disciplining Rod on 6 Exhausted Vrykul.	Discipline	Let's start you off with something straightforward. The male vrykul that work the mines for us do so against their will... purely out of fear of our blades. Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation. Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place. Take this disciplining rod. You'll want to inflict pain, not death. Well, most of the time anyway. 
Travel to Mosswalker Village and speak to Moodle once you've arrived. If you lose Moodle's Stress Ball, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	The Angry Gorloc	I not think you be back in time to go out again, but I wrong. I sending Moodle to nearby Mosswalker friends to bop silly Mosswalkers for not coming see shrine. Their village is east, up ridge, northeast of broken pillar. You go with Moodle! He extra smart Rainspeaker... you listen to him good-like. 
Gino at Garm's Rise wants you to plant the Hardpacked Explosive Bundle near Frostgut's Altar, kill Tormar Frostgut, and then escape the cave before it collapses on you.	A Flawless Plan	Hey there! Joining us for the assault I assume? I've got a special task for you... we're going to bring the whole cave down on their heads! Towards the back of their cave, you should find Frostgut's Altar. Sneak up and plant this hardpacked explosive bundle somewhere close to it. Once the charge is placed, stick around just long enough to make sure Frostgut bites it, then get out quickly! There's no knowing how long the cave will last once that thing goes off! 
Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village wants you to collapse the Nerubian sinkholes using the Horn of Elemental Fury and defeat Lord Kryxix.	The Collapse	I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields. The quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will. 
Free High Chief Icemist using the Anub'ar Prison Key and assist him in defeating Under-king Anub'et'kan. Recover a Fragment of Anub'et'kan's Husk and return it to Overlord Agmar at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.	Return of the High Chief	<Banthok hands you the prison key.>You must hurry, George. Take the key and use it to unchain my father from the Anub'ar prison. Once he is freed, assist him in destroying the Anub'ar leader, Under-king Anub'et'kan. When the Under-king is defeated, take from his chitinous carapace a fragment as a trophy to present to the Horde at Agmar's Hammer. Let Agmar see the might of the High Chief! 
Accompany Brann Bronzebeard and his flying machine to Frosthold.	The Brothers Bronzebeard	That does it! We finally have the keystone... It's beautiful! I've been around the world more than once, but this thing's got me all jittery with excitement again. I suppose now's not the time to stop and admire though, we need to get the heck out of here. Hop on my flying machine and help keep us covered from those iron dwarves on the way out! 
Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to use the Drakil'jin Mallet on the gongs outside Drakil'jin Ruins. Once you have been slain, you are to enter the ruins and speak with the spirit of Gan'jo while you are dead.	See You on the Other Side	These Drakkari have met you with nothing but savage hostility. You owe them nothing. Few indeed would carry out the task that Kraz asks of you today. To cleanse this place and send the spirits to their eternal rest, you must join them in death. There is one inside the crypt who awaits you - on the other side. He holds the knowledge we seek, George. Use the mallet on the gongs. The spirit of he who corrupts this place will surely deliver you to the spirit world. Kraz awaits your return. 
Obtain the Omega Rune inside the Shaper's Terrace and bring it to The Etymidian.	The Activation Rune	This colossal being appears to be inactive. You notice an empty rune-shaped slot on its chest. Perhaps you might be able to find the missing rune inside the nearby overlook. 
Seek out Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.	Audience With The Dragon Queen	Our assault against Angrathar has staggered the Scourge, but they remain unrelenting. From overhead they send their frost wyrms to strafe the field of battle, making an advance upon the gate itself impossible. The frost wyrm attacks must be stopped, but before we defile the bones of ancient dragons, we must gain permission from their queen. Travel southeast to Wyrmrest Temple and seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Tell her what we must do and ask her for guidance. Go now, George! 
Recover Frostgrip's Signet Ring from an Iron Dwarf Monitor and then bring it to Creteus in the Foot Steppes.	The Lonesome Watcher	I never found the core... but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the Engine of the Makers. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus's favor. The iron dwarves were here looking for something... it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you. 
Speak to Mildred the Cruel inside the Forlorn Mine.	Mildred the Cruel	Our deal is made then, George. You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend. The Hyldnir who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason. Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines. Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles. 
Find your way back to Frenzyheart Hill and speak to High-Shaman Rakjak.	Hoofing It	Okay, we done! Time to go back. No crocolisk to ride this time though. If we go east and stay near ridge, it should lead all the way back near hill. Need to be careful not to go far below ridge though or we might go right into big-tongue tree village thing. Zepik not think they like us right now. 
Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 8 Fjord Hawk Eggs. Return to Hidalgo with the cage when you have completed this task.	There Exists No Honor Among Birds	You are most definitely ready for the next step in falconry, George. Take your trained falcon east of here, to the vrykul hawk roost near the Stonewall Lift. From the roost you will send out your falcon to steal the eggs of the hawks. Their nests will be located in remote areas of the cliff walls surrounding the roost. Locate those nests and use your falcon to scavenge for the eggs! Beware the fjord hawk matriarchs, George. Should you come under attack, use your falcon's escape and soar abilities to flee! 
Speak with the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.	Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Hammer	Mechanic, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Agmar's Hammer with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives. The Hammer is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. Archmage Aethas Sunreaver himself will be expecting you! 
Goregek has given you a Softknuckle Poker for use on Softknuckles to draw the Hardknuckle Matriarch out of hiding. Slay the Hardknuckle Matriarch and report her death to High-Shaman Rajak at Frenzyheart Hill. If you lose Goregek's Shackles, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	Tormenting the Softknuckles	Slave thing! Rakjak want me to babysit you while I kill hardknuckles. I feeling generous today, so I let you kill some too, but don't get in Goregek's way! Rakjak not know yet, but Goregek has eye on big bad hardknuckle mama. We go to Hardknuckle Clearing to east and poke softknuckles with poker and she sure to come yelling!<Goregek rubs his hands together gleefully.> 
Accompany Kalecgos to Coldarra. Speak to him when you are ready.	Emergency Extraction	Now, back to the matter at hand...I am convinced that the vision in the Nexus is one of Deathwing's illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time. The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting. Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution. It would be wise for me to take Tarecgosa and withdraw until the time of choosing. 
Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.	Return To Caladis Brightspear	We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at keeping the Sunreavers at bay. Take it with you to Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Caladis and the sword will be waiting. The sooner we can identify the blade, the sooner we can claim it. 
Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to obtain 8 slabs of Fresh Ice Rhino Meat and use them to feed the Stormcrest Eagles above town.	Loyal Companions	Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time. Off to the east are the Foot Steppes... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there. If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there. 
Spy Mistress Repine at Venomspite has asked you to steal the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Abbey, Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Barracks, and Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Beach.	Need to Know	I need to know what New Hearthglen is up to. I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out. Head south and in their abbey, in their barracks, and on their beach, find those daily plans! Just in case you're confused, the barracks is the large building right next to the smithy. 
Recover the Staff of Storm's Fury and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.	The Staff of Storm's Fury	Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, Human. I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed. Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the Isle of Spears, north of here. If you want that thing, check the ship's hold. Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of Abdul! He'll tear your heart out. 
Collect an Engine-Core Crystal, a Magical Gyroscope, and a Piloting Scourgestone. Deliver them to Tinky Wickwhistle at Talramas.	I'm Stuck in this Damned Cage... But Not For Long!	The cultists magicked me into this cage and there's no door to it. Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip! With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long. I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the ghouls in here, a magical gyroscope from their doctor, and a piloting scourgestone from the lich-lord up top. With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to Fizzcrank's and escape the gnome way! 
Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to obtain the Prison Casing from General Cerulean and the Energy Core from Warbringer Goredrak.	The Cell	You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, George. Malygos' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured mages and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something... stronger. In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments. They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings. 
Bring Bushwhacker's Jaw to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Crocolisk Mastery: The Ambush	The largest crocolisk in the basin, known around here as ""Bushwhacker"" for his ambush prowess, likes to sun himself in the shallow waters of River's Heart. It's the large lake at the basin's center, and is to the east of our camp. I want you to take the camouflage I've prepared and hide on the western beach of River's Heart and ambush Bushwhacker when he shows himself. Bring back his mighty jaws if you are able to overcome him. 
Aurochs Grimbane at Death's Rise wants you to collect 5 Onslaught Intel Documents.	Intelligence Gathering	I need to know what the Scarlet Onslaught is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task. Fly to Onslaught Harbor and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means. 
Banthok Icemist at Icemist Village in the Dragonblight has asked that you bring him Anok'ra's Key Fragment, Tivax's Key Fragment and Sinok's Key Fragment.	Chains of the Anub'ar	They have my father bound by magical chains in the middle of Icemist Village. From what I have been able to gather, the prison is controlled by three powerful Anub'ar magi - each holding a piece of the key. Scour Icemist and locate the magi. Kill them and take their key fragments. With all three pieces we might be able to free my father. Once he is free...Retribution will come swiftly. 
Thorim wants you to slay Eisenfaust inside the Hall of the Shaper and Halefnir the Windborn and Duronn the Runeforged in the Terrace of the Makers.	Loken's Lackeys	The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on my brother's behalf. He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants. Use the Horn of the Peaks to call the earthen to your side and defeat Loken's servants. You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the Hall of the Shaper to the north. You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest. 
Chief Engineer Copperclaw aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to throw a Writhing Mass into a cauldron at Aldur'thar.	Retest Now	This should do the trick! Those twisted hooligans are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit! Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... Its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence once you've defeated them. When you've collected a bunch of essences, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons. Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine! 
Eadric the Pure at the Argent Tournament wants you to defeat Chillmaw and 3 Cultist Bombardiers.	Threat From Above	Highlord Tirion Fordring has doubled the guard since your exposure of the Cult of the Damned's infiltrator. He doesn't believe that they will stop just because their Black Knight has been defeated. Our skytalon scouts have reported sighting a frost wyrm named Chillmaw leading a cult raiding party. If we don't intercept them, the tournament will come under attack. The scouts reporting seeing Chillmaw to the southwest, flying over the area between the Ironwall Rampart and Aldur'thar. 
Commune with The Pearl of the Depths and do as the sea-goddess Oacha'noa instructs. Should you survive the ordeal, return to Toalu'u the Mystic at Moa'ki Harbor.	Conversing With the Depths	The watery goddess, Oacha'noa, must be consulted; only she will know what the destiny of the Kalu'ak is to be. And only The Pearl of the Depths can call her forth from the murky nether. Off the coast to the southwest rises The Briny Pinnacle. Atop it sits the altar upon which the pearl rests. Commune at the altar and Oacha'noa is certain to hear your call. Do as she says lest you incur her wrath and bring ruin upon all of the tuskarr. Should you survive, return to the mystic. 
Report to Recruitment Officer Blythe at Valiance Keep in Borean Tundra.	Hero's Call: Borean Tundra!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Recruitment Officer Blythe at Valiance Keep in Borean Tundra. The Valiance Expedition needs your help to keep the forces of the Scourge under control and safeguard civilized lands! Make your way to the Stormwind Docks and take the ship north to Valiance Keep. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 
Speak to Courier Lanson at Stars' Rest in Dragonblight.	The Lost Courier	We're lucky we made it this far, George. We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed. One of our men turned out to be a spy for the Cult of the Damned. Thassarian appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration. Apparently it goes all the way to the top. I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name. 
Spy Mistress Repine has asked you to slay Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Kinnedius, Engineer Burke, and Chancellor Amai. When you've accomplished this task, report your success to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.	No Mercy for the Captured	We have more fools for you to kill. My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught. This will not do. Go back to New Hearthglen and eliminate Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Kinnedius, Engineer Burke and Chancellor Amai. From what I hear, they're spread out throughout the area. No doubt they are being kept in cages awaiting torture. Speak with them and then kill them! 
Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight wants you to hear the tales of a Forgotten Peasant, Forgotten Rifleman, Forgotten Knight and Forgotten Footman.	The Forgotten Tale	The toxins in the murkweed elixir will render you unconscious. So powerful is the effect of the murkweed that even your spirit will be fooled, allowing you to temporarily enter the world of the dead. Once a spirit, you must speak to the ghostly denizens of the Forgotten Shore. Seek out the cause of their anguish and return to me. Remember, George, these spirits were once Alliance soldiers. Treat them with respect, honor and dignity. Now, with elixir in hand, venture south to the Forgotten Shore. 
Donathan on Amber Ledge has tasked you with using the Beryl Shield Detonator to bring down the shield at Beryl Point. You are then to defeat Salrand and collect the key she holds.	A Race Against Time	So it's true. They have her. It's clear what must be done, Human. She WILL be saved. I must remain here and aid in the rescue preparations. I call upon you again; this time to collect the prison key. All we know of this Salrand figure is that she cannot be harmed so long as her shield is intact. We've customized a special explosive that should strip her of this protection, allowing you to perform your duty. Return to me when you've collected the key. Hurry, George. Lady Evanor is suffering! 
Return 10 Relics of Ulduar to Olut Alegut at the Grom'arsh Crash-site.	Ancient Relics	Welcome to the peaks. I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned. There are relics and treasures of ancient Ulduar scattered through these mountains. Most are likely in possession of the various sentient races. Return any that you find to me, and I will reward you in kind. Perhaps I'll even let you partake on my many potent ales. 
Brglmurgl at Winterfin Retreat has asked you to kill 15 Winterfin murlocs. Any combination of warriors, oracles, and shorestrikers will do.	Them!	Our brothers and sisters across the water are now our mortal enemies. They have kidnapped our tadpoles, driven us out of our village, and killed more of us than I can count. Prove yourself, Human! Swim across the rift and slay them! Despite the favor that the new king has shown you, only then will we consider accepting you here. Fail to do so, and you might as well leave now and never return! 
Find Thorim at the southeastern edge of the Terrace of the Makers, just northwest of Dun Niffelem.	The Terrace of the Makers	It is time, George. I am prepared to face Loken now. Let us make our way to the Terrace of the Makers and face my brother's forces. The fool will regret ever crossing me. 
Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to use her pendant on 7 Chill Nymphs.	The Fallen Sisters	To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change. We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope. Take my pendant, travel southwest to the Vibrant Glade, and use it to try to free my sisters. 
Garren on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Cleftcliff Anomaly.	Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly	Greetings, Human. I am Garren of Dalaran. Not long ago, the rift was a peaceful place - geothermally speaking at least. Recently though, earthquakes have occurred with alarming frequency and scars in the earth have appeared, exposing unique energy fields of chaotic power. My mission here is to chart and monitor these anomalies. My instruments indicate that another has appeared on the cliff face to the southwest. Take this device with you and use it when you locate the new disruption. 
King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to slay Jorcuttar in Hibernal Cavern.	Culling Jorcuttar	The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire. They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region. She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave. Place it near her crater and kill her as she feeds. 
Sergeant Moonshard at Drak'Sotra insists that you return with the Head of the Corrupter.	Malas the Corrupter	George, head back down there! You'll find the leader of Kolramas, Malas the Corrupter, gloating from atop the crashed necropolis. Kill him and bring me his head! 
Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to, in a single combat, defeat all six of the fallen heroes: Eldreth, Geness Half-Soul, Jhadras, Masud, Rith, and Talla. Should you succeed, speak with Gjonner the Merciless overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes	If you believe yourself ready to begin then I have just the match for you to cut your teeth on. Another group of outsiders thought themselves prepared for the rigors of Valhalas. They had much hubris, but in the end they fell like all of the others. If you think yourselves so different -- if you think that you have the skill and experience to fight here amongst such storied warriors -- then please accept the challenge. 
Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker to throw rocks at Umbral Brutes as they near lesser undead in Malykriss. Return after you've started 5 fights.	Matchmaker	The major difference between vargul and lesser undead minions is that vargul still possess enough of their minds to despise being used for labor. Never will a vargul be pleased to be working aside skeletons or ghouls. Lets take advantage of this inevitable animosity and start some fights between the umbral brutes and the other undead in Malykriss. That should serve to slow production and bring the death knights down to babysit. Should be simple - throw rocks at the brutes as they near lesser undead. 
You are to go to Frostfield Lake, kill the Brittle Revenants there and use the Essence of Ice on the Smoldering Scraps at Fjorn's Anvil. You are then to collect 6 of the Frozen Iron scraps and return to Fjorn's Anvil in Dun Niffelem.	Hot and Cold	As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here. It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape--shrapnel from the battle fought there. If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct to explore the thundering cave at Baelgun's Excavation Site. Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.	The Delicate Sound of Thunder	The cavern that we opened at Baelgun's was the one place that most steered clear of... Can't say I blame 'em. The sound of thunder shot out of that cave, George! Loud, booming thunder! I think near the end, it was abandoned by all. Bad, bad things happened to any that went in to explore - most never coming back. I want you to check that cave out while you're at Baelgun's. Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings. 
Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to defeat 6 Victorious Challengers.	Defending Your Title	Everyone's impressed by your performance, sister. But do not let your guard down -- every new challenger with delusions of grandeur is going to come out swinging for your title of Hyldskvinnar. Show these upstarts what you're made of. 
Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has asked you to use the Challenge Flag to challenge and defeat 6 Mjordin Combatants.	Honor Challenge	The first step we're going to take is at a place in Jotunheim called the Savage Ledge. It's just over the mountains to the west. On the ledge the vrykul warriors are always sparring, being instructed in the finer arts of battle by their thane's men. I want you to take this flag and issue a challenge to a number of them. Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a Human, shall we?<The duke grins, his rotting teeth flashing in the dim light of the vault.> 
Slay the Muddled Prophet of Sseratus and then return to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand.	Too Much of a Good Thing	There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus. At least that's the theory. As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar. Unless you can kill him, Mechanic, your Argent Crusade is about to come to a terrible end. 
Retrieve a Wintergarde Mine Bomb and use it to blow up the Upper Wintergarde Mine Shaft and the Lower Wintergarde Mine Shaft. Report back to Siege Engineer Quarterflash at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight when you have completed this task.	Leave Nothing to Chance	If there is good in your heart and your conscience is clear, read on. In this mine, near the foreman's scaffold, rests a hefty cargo of dynamite. Go there and pick up several bundles of the explosive and make your way towards the entrance of the mine. Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for the upper and lower entry points of Wintergarde Mine. You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. Light guide you. 
High Executor Wroth at Venomspite has ordered you to return with The Head of the High General.	Do Unto Others	Their attack is imminent, Mechanic. I need you to get in there and sever the head of the Scarlet Onslaught, literally! It's not going to be easy... Abbendis is sure to be surrounded by a great many of her men. Bring back her head and I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded for saving Venomspite. Fail and don't even bother to return! 
Deliver 5 Basilisk Crystals to Alchemist Finklestein in the shrine at Heb'Valok.	Gluttonous Lurkers	My master, Finklestein, is in the shrine at Heb'Valok to the northwest preparing a truth serum, and he needs basilisk crystals. Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the Altar of Sseratus. There are basilisks to the east at Drak'Agal. If you grab the Zul'Drak rats and throw them at the basilisk, they will become gorged and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals. Killing the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals! 
Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest has asked you to slay High Cultist Zangus.	The High Cultist	I have dreamed of Zangus before but without the context that you have discovered, I knew not what it meant. You have brought clarity to the vision that the goddess has bestowed upon me, and now I know that he can be found within the Pit of Narjun to the north. You know your target, George. If there's to be an end to the suffering of the land, the high cultist must die! 
Donathan wants you to speak to Surristrasz on Amber Ledge.	Reforging the Key	Delays, delays... the one thing we cannot afford right now! As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved Evanor. Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable. Hurry, Mechanic, our assault team is waiting. 
Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to slay the Prophet of Akali.	Convocation at Zol'Heb	You must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to Zol'Heb just south of Gundrak. Therein you will find a circle of power. Use the convocation to force the prophet of Akali to appear. My heart goes out to you, George. We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed. But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Rocket Jump ability at Walt's Iron Rune Carving. Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.	Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping	Alright, George; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct. Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here. 
Fill the Empty Apothecary's Flask at the Cauldron of Vrykul Blood, then mix the Flask of Vrykul Blood with Harris's Plague Samples nearby until you've obtained a Balanced Concoction. Return to Chief Plaguebringer Harris when you've completed this task.	Apply Heat and Stir	You've done well so far, George. I'd like to teach you some of my more advanced techniques, so that you gain a better understanding of the plague. Take this empty flask and fill it with blood from the cauldron to my left. Mix it with the plague samples to my right until you obtain a well balanced mix. 
Thorim, at the Temple of Storms, wants you to obtain 5 Small Proto-Drake Eggs from the peaks near Brunnhildar Village.	Veranus	If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around. I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago. Veranus was magnificent. The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned. Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way. She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride. She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding. Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar. I think I've an idea. 
Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to ring the bell in the abbey and then go speak with the high abbot and get information out of him.	A Fall From Grace	We need more information from the high abbot, and now that we have the visage of one of the raven priests, I think we can get you close to talk with him. Unfortunately, we need to separate him from his bodyguards or you'll never get any information out of him.<The agent leans on her shovel and thinks a moment.>I think I've got it! While in disguise, go to the top of the abbey and ring the bell. That should bring the abbot's bodyguards running and you can then head down to speak with him. 
Elder Atkanok outside Coldrock Quarry wants you to identify the statues of Elder Kesuk, Elder Sagani, and Elder Takret.	The Honored Ancestors	<A distant voice echoes in your head as you regard the stone statue.>Do not be startled, stranger. I am Elder Atkanok, an ancient ancestor of the tuskarr people, a skilled craftsman in my own time and the guardian of this quarry for centuries. The quarry has been overrun, leaving many statues unfinished while the ancestors' spirits wander the world. Will you aid me in righting this wrong? First, I must know the names of these wandering ancestors. Look for the markers near their statues. 
	The Amphitheater of Anguish: Magnataur!	This next match is a doozy, buddy! Apparently some magnataur from the Dragonblight wants a piece of the action. You ever fought one of those before? All I can tell you is to aim high! We'll get this party started when you give me the word. 
Crusade Architect Silas at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to retrieve 10 Trunks of Crystalline Heartwood and 10 pieces of Ancient Elven Masonry.	The Stone That Started A Revolution	You may look at Scourgeholme now and see a rancid pit of decay, but one day it will be a place of glory and honor. Highlord Fordring has deemed it ""Justice Keep.""Alas, even an impregnable fortress like Icecrown Citadel began with but a single stone. So begins our search for the stone to start a revolution. Travel to Crystalsong, south of here, and seek out the Unbound Thicket in the east. Once there gather crystalline heartwood from the thicket floor and elven masonry from the Ruins of Shandaral. 
Speak to Mother Tauranook outside the gates of Taunka'le Village.	The Fall of Taunka'le Village	We are lost, George. This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death... Death and a memory of what used to be. I have called for the evacuation of Taunka'le. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, Icemist, located in the Dragonblight.<Wintergale points east.>You must help get my people to safety, George. Mother Tauranook awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The Scourge closes in from all sides! 
Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to kill Coldarra Wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break 5 blue dragon eggs.	Hatching a Plan	Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from Malygos, observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you. The blues are laying their eggs at the base of the Nexus. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn. I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs. 
Defeat Thel'zan the Duskbringer and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.	An End And A Beginning	Every good story has a beginning and an ending, George. While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning out to be the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come. Now, ally, when you are ready I will use the phylactery to coax Thel'zan out of hiding. Should we somehow succeed, report the victory to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep. 
Ulfang has asked you to slay Garwal. Then, return the Worg Disguise to Watcher Moonleaf at Steel Gate.	Alpha Worg	When you've eaten Talonshrike's eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat! Human-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western Rivenwood. After you have killed him, go and tell Moonleaf that I am once more the alpha worg! 
Seek out Roanauk Icemist at Agmar's Hammer and initiate him as a member and leader of the Horde forces. Return to Overlord Agmar with the Blood Oath of the Horde when you complete this task.	All Hail Roanauk!	Like the tauren, Forsaken, trolls and blood elves, so too do the taunka need a leader born of their own blood. The one you saved from Icemist, Roanauk, will be this leader.<Overlord Agmar hands you a parchment.>I give to you something familiar - the blood oath of the Horde. Take the oath to Roanauk Icemist and initiate him into the Horde as leader of the taunka. Let us not keep him waiting.<Agmar nods.> 
Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to use the Forsaken Blight Spreader's Blight Bomb to destroy 30 Hungering Dead on the outskirts of the Carrion Fields.	Spread the Good Word	Before I can ship you off to Doctor Malefious with the good news, you will have to run a simple field test of the blight with the modifications I have made. The hungering dead stream out from what remains of Old Wintergarde. Commandeer a vehicle from the east gate and drive it northeast through Vengeance Pass until you reach the twin towers at the southeastern edge of Wintergarde. Drop the blight bomb on the undead that cover the area. Report back to me with the results! 
Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to return to Drakuru and complete any tasks he has for you. While at the Reliquary of Pain, you are to use the Diluting Additive on 5 Blight Cauldrons. If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Watch to get another.	So Far, So Bad	Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions. Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, George. A great deal is riding upon your performance. This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless. 
Reconvene with Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village.	A Change of Scenery	Excellent. There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village. Follow it and I'll meet you there. We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me. I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance. Do not worry, Human -- we'll find your friend in no time. 
The Spirit of Rhunok has asked you to use the Tormentor's Incense to awaken his body. You are then to slay Rhunok using the power that his spirit has imbued you with. If for some reason you lose the Mojo of Rhunok aura, you can return to the Spirit of Rhunok to have it reapplied.	An End to the Suffering	My body is too far gone now, George. It is only a matter of time before a new prophet is elevated and finishes what the other began. I am going to imbue you with the last of my power. The tormentor inside the altar building carries incense, which will awaken my body and make it vulnerable. Use the incense and do me the kindness of putting an end to my suffering. I apologize if I fight back. Even for me, the will to survive is strong. 
Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise wants you to beat information out of Captains Welsington and Hartford.	In Strict Confidence	If anyone knows where the admiral is, then surely it must be his captains on the ships in Onslaught Harbor.<The lord-commander rubs his hands together.>Welsington and Hartford are their names if memory serves. Go beat the information out of them and then end their miserable lives. I want to know where the grand admiral is hidden! 
Surristrasz wants you to travel to Coldarra. Once there, you are to speak with Archmage Berinand.	Traversing the Rift	I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you. The time has come to peel back a layer of darkness from your mind. There are stark truths that you have grown ready to accept. Before hearing the tale, you shall be shown firsthand what we face. Put your affairs in order, Mechanic.... 
Speak to Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer.	Victory Nears...	There remain only two primary threats that stand in our way. One is the dread citadel of Naxxramas, far to the east, above the Alliance fortress of Wintergarde and the other is the Pit of Narjun, exit point for the undead armies of Azjol'Nerub. It is from the Pit of Narjun that the Anub'ar Nerubians assaulted and ultimately razed the taunka village of Icemist. We will destroy the Anub'ar and close off the Pit of Narjun. Report to Senior Sergeant Juktok for your mission orders. 
Deliver The Forsaken Blight to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer.	The Forsaken Blight	I have prepared a package that must be delivered to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer. The contents of the package include the final blight specimen along with instructions on preparation and samples of the reactive agent. You will find Agmar's Hammer in western Dragonblight. Just look for the black, jagged metal orc buildings - that will be Agmar's Hammer. 
Stefan in Ebon Watch asked you to go to the Reliquary of Agony to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the Putrid Abominations and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools.	You Can Run, But You Can't Hide	Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it. You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse....<Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.>... unless we can use their desires against them. I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components. Travel due east of here to the Reliquary of Agony. Slay abominations and gather the ghoul drool you'll find there then return to me with their remnants. 
Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. Then, return with the horn to Celea Frozenmane at Camp Winterhoof.	The Frost Wyrm and its Master	Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must venture west to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile! Even now it may be on its way! If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it! And George, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands! 
Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest has asked you to use the Liquid Fire of Elune to cleanse the corpses of 6 Blighted Elk and 6 Rabid Grizzlies.	The Liquid Fire of Elune	Human will you assist me? The Scourge have moved into Icemist to the north. Wherever they go, they spread their taint, and the creatures of the land suffer. Take this vial, which is filled with the liquid fire of Elune from the moonwell. Please, use the liquid to cleanse the corpses of the blighted wildlife that you find. 
Look for Thassarian inside the Wailing Ziggurat, north of Death's Stand.	Thassarian, the Death Knight	Well, George, you helped us out... so I figure it's only fair that we help you out as well. You're looking for Thassarian? He disappeared this morning. We think he went off north to the Wailing Ziggurat. If we hadn't fought side by side by him we'd even think he was a traitor. See, he's a Death Knight... and I know they're on our side and all... but it wasn't too long ago they were servants of Arthas. But not Thassarian, he's a good guy. Go to the Wailing Ziggurat, see if he's doing okay. 
Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has ordered you to read the Shadow Vault Decree in the presence of Thane Ufrang the Mighty, and then to slay him.	Shadow Vault Decree	Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within his hall overlooking the Savage Ledge. I've studied him. The thane is a patient vrykul, with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle. I need him dead! I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud.<The duke arches his eyebrow in amusement.>It should... unnerve him at the least. 
Win a Wintergrasp battleground match and return to Tactical Officer Abrahmis in Wintergrasp. You must have participated in the battle to be credited for the victory.	Victory in Wintergrasp	Commander Zanneth might be satisfied with a pile of Horde corpses at his feet, but controlling Wintergrasp is of the utmost importance to the Valiance Expedition. Make sure it remains in our control. However, don't think we'll just let you stand around while your allies do your dirty work for you. If you're not at least a second level recruit by the end of the battle, don't come back. 
Find Shadowstalker Luther in Mightstone Quarry.	Untold Truths	We are here by order of Varimathras! The mission of the Shadowstalkers is a simple one: spy. Well, spy with a little assassination on the side. One of my best field agents has gone missing. I haven't heard from him in days, which has left me fearing the worst. No, not death! Death would be ideal. I fear he may have gone rogue... turned traitor even. His last known location was northern Mightstone Quarry. He was gathering intelligence on the Nerubians. Find him. He better be dead... 
Keeper Remulos at Moonglade has instructed you to enter the emerald dream and recover 3 Emerald Acorns. Leave the vicinity of the Shrine of Remulos to return to Azeroth.	Hope Within the Emerald Nightmare	What we need exists only in the emerald dream... acorns that are infused with a powerful restorative magic. Many places in this sacred glade are closely tied with the dream, and my shrine is among them. I will send you into the dream to recover some of these acorns. Be prepared though Mechanic, for this method of entering the dream is dangerous, and it is very likely you will be beset by nightmares. Recover a few acorns quickly, and then depart from my shrine or pinch yourself to return to our world. 
Open the Wooden Cage and help the Freed Alliance Scout escape from Silverbrook. Report to Lieutenant Dumont when you reach Amberpine Lodge.	Escape from Silverbrook	You... you're not one of them? Quick! Let me out! We have to get to Amberpine Lodge immediately! Once Lieutenant Dumont finds out who these people really are, this town will be reduced to rubble! 
Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to go to the Reliquary of Pain and use the Scepter of Empowerment on a Servant of Drakuru. You are then to use its abilities to defeat Darmuk.	Zero Tolerance	Ignorance! Dis be intolerable, mon! My entire batch of blight be useless! Dat mongrel, Darmuk! He be responsible for watchin over da blight. He failed me, mon! Dis be a good lesson for ya, George. Failure be like a disease dat spreads. Ya gotta catch it and kill it early, before it be killin' you! Take dis scepter. It make my scourged trolls stronger. Use dem ta kill Darmuk. He be lurkin' down below just to da south. Let dat be an example to all, mon. Don't be failin' Drakuru! 
Captain Adams has ordered you to get 5 bomb hits on the Plague Tanks at New Agamand. Do not return to him at Westguard Keep until you have accomplished that.	Mission: Plague This!	The Royal Apothecary Society thinks they're going to perfect a new plague to melt us down where we stand?!Not on my watch! Get out to the courtyard and speak with Greer Orehammer. He's got a gryphon and some bombs ready for you. I want you to bomb the plague tanks at New Agamand to smithereens! 
Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Magister Hathorel.	A Meeting With The Magister	I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Sunreaver Sanctuary's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way into The Filthy Animal and meet up with the Sunreaver contact there, one Magister Hathorel. Obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest while your disguise holds, and return it to me. 
Commander Kunz at The Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their leaders' orders, and then return and report to him. Captain Brandon and Captain Rupert are posted at Drak'Sotra, Southeast of here. Captain Grondel is posted in Drak'Agal, due east. Alchemist Finklestein is posted in Heb'Valok, to the north.	Pa'Troll	Welcome to The Argent Stand, scrub. I am Commander Kunz, but you - you can call me... Commander. Don't think you're going to just cruise through my region, picking which missions you're going to participate in, answering to no one. Here, you report to me and you follow my orders to the letter. Understood?!First, you're going to get familiar with my men and the region we're charged with clearing. Report to each of them and do as they ask. Return to me when your patrol is done. 
Help Getry defeat Varidus the Flenser at Warsong Farms. Report to Garrosh Hellscream should you succeed.	Foolish Endeavors	This is madness. How do they expect us to take on a Scourge necrolord and an unknown number of his minions?<Getry sighs.>If Ickoris sent you he must think that you are capable of great feats. Perhaps you will call down a miracle today, eh? When you're ready we will descend and face Varidus. If we make it out of this mess in one piece, report back to Hellscream in Warsong Hold. 
Speak with Imperean at the Ruins of Eldra'nath.	The Sky Will Know	I must find out what happened to my master, Farseer Grimwalker! Earlier, he was observing the magnataur at nearby Magmoth. But one of his grunts just returned, saying that the group had been crushed, and that the farseer was dragged into the depths of the place. Before I send you on a suicide mission, I wish to consult with the spirits to learn more. There is an air elemental known as Imperean in the ruins of Eldra'nath to the west. She is wise and may give you the information we seek. 
Recover Thel'zan's Phylactery from Icestorm and return it to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.	Chasing Icestorm: Thel'zan's Phylactery	Your frostwyrm is out there.<Tyralion points west.>And it's a big one! When you're ready to fight, go speak with ""Wyrmbait."" He'll ""fetch"" her. Once Icestorm is close enough we'll chain her to the ground and finish her off! Hopefully, with your help, we'll be able to take her down and get you that phylactery. Once you've got the phylactery, return to Wintergarde Keep and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He's been making preparations for the final showdown with Thel'zan. 
Soo-nee, at the Rainspeaker Canopy, wants you to play the Cleansing Chime at Bittertide Lake, Wintergrasp River and River's Heart and slay the evil spirits that plague the waters there.	A Cleansing Song	Earth in Sholazar is pure. The pillars have protected the land for centuries. Water, not as pure, it comes from outside Sholazar.... from oceans, from lakes, from rivers. Water sometimes bring bad spirits - need to be cleansed. You take this chime and play at Bittertide Lake, Wintergrasp River and River's Heart. It make bad spirit angry... and then you must kill it. 
Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy the Metal Stake imprisoning Patches in the Sanctum of Reanimation and help him get his revenge on Doctor Sabnok.	A Visit to the Doctor	So they've been embedding these ghouls with broken shards of saronite down in the Sanctum of Reanimation? We must put a stop to this, before these ghouls can be deployed against our troops. Find the entrance to the Sanctum of Reanimation in the flesh giant lab area of the Fleshwerks. There, the ghoul mastermind, Doctor Sabnok, keeps the most fearsome of his creations, Patches. Free Patches from his chains and help him take his revenge on the doctor. Let his own creation be his undoing. 
Kill 8 Hardknuckle Foragers and 6 Hardknuckle Chargers for High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill. If you lose Goregek's Shackles, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	The Ape Hunter's Slave	You think you so great hunter, eh? You no Frenzyheart, you not know of hunt. Goregek is great ape hunter. He slay so many ape you can't count on claws. You go with Goregek and hunt hardknuckles to east. You the slave, Human. You do what Goregek tell you. 
Using the RJR Rifle, shoot the apple on top of Lucky Wilhelm's head, then speak with Drostan.	Kick, What Kick?	So you think you can shoot? Well, let's give it a try. Here, we'll start you out with something nice and gentle. Don't worry, it's got no kick to it at all. Remember, don't point that gun at anything you don't intend to fire at. Now, when you're ready, just take aim at that apple on top o' old Lucky Wilhelm's head and let 'er fly! 
King Mrgl-Mrgl has given you a conch to use upon Scalder's remains. Return The King's Filled Conch to him at Winterfin Retreat.	Learning to Communicate	To help, you must learn how to speak the Winterfin dialect. We'll work with the forces of nature and magic to do that. Take this empty conch shell. At the bottom of the watery trench below exists Scalder, an elemental of air and watery fury. Once she is defeated, use the conch upon her remains to capture her magical steam. Return the full conch to me, and I'll imbue my knowledge of the Winterfin tongue into you. Luckily, a friend taught me a water breathing spell, which I will cast upon you. 
The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village wants you to possess a Water Terror and use it to slay 10 vrykul in the greater Jotunheim region. Qualifying vrykul are Jotunheim Sleep-Watchers, Jotunheim Warriors, Mjordin Water Magi, Njorndar Spear-Sisters, and Valhalas Vargul.	The Art of Being a Water Terror	The water lock outside my cave is teeming with elementals that the vrykul magi have yet to tame. I am going to teach you a trick for possessing these creatures for a short time, and you will use them to wreak havoc upon Jotunheim!<The banshee-infested vrykul draws magic in the air and touches a large finger to your forehead.>Go now and open the gate to the lock. A water terror will rush out and you will possess it to destroy our enemies! 
Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Horn of the Ancient Mariner to summon Orabus the Helmsman. Once summoned, slay Orabus the Helmsman.	Orabus the Helmsman	Take the horn and travel west to the Warsong Jetty. Make your way to the end of the jetty and blow into the horn. The sound should rouse Orabus. Slay the foul beast and return to me! 
Slay Clam Master K and return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment.	The Nefarious Clam Master...	It's despicable, really, to anoint one's self as the ""Clam Master,"" as if they hold mastery over the creatures of the sea. None may make such claims! This ""Clam Master"" must be found and slain. He was last seen at the wreckage just off the coast of the Abandoned Reach. Find him and kill him. Once this is done, return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment, north of here, and let her know that the mission was a success. 
Use Imperean's Primal to perform a ritual at Snarlfang's Totem at Bor'gorok Outpost to gain information concerning Farseer Grimwalker. Afterward, speak with Spirit Talker Snarlfang.	Vision of Air	Here, George, I've attuned the primal to you. Open your soul to it in the presence of my totem of air and concentrate upon the fate of Farseer Grimwalker. The spirit of the wind touches all; with any luck you will be granted a vision. 
Mrmrglmr wants you to return to him at Winterfin Retreat with Glrggl's Head.	Grmmurggll Mrllggrl Glrggl!!!	If your pathetic little eyes were any good, you'd see that we're being slaughtered by the orcas to the north in the bay! Assuming your precious night elf king wants his spare costume back, I think you'll do me a favor and bring back the head of the king of the orcas, Glrggl: he who swims against the tides of fate -- eradicating the hope of life for all those who hear the siren song of death upon the waves! Be quick about it, Human, Winterfin murlocs are losing their lives even as we waste time talking! 
Meet with General Arlos inside the barracks in Valiance Keep.	Enlistment Day	You've come to enlist, right? Normally you'd have to stand in line like the other recruits. Normally you'd be out of luck because the recruitment ledger's gone missing and I can't process anyone until the new books get here. Fortunately for you, George, I've heard about you and what you did in Outland. To be honest, you're a cut above these poor saps. Lines aren't for you. Go to the barracks and speak to General Arlos. He'll be more than happy to meet with someone of your caliber. 
The Avatar of Freya wants you to head to the Makers' Overlook in eastern Sholazar Basin and use the Activation Switch Theta.	Powering the Waygate - The Makers' Overlook	We cannot stop now, Human. You've triggered the first switch, but one remains. The titans constructed a second vantage point where they oversaw their creations. You'll find it to the east, high in the mountains. Pull the activation switch theta inside the overlook and the waygate will open. 
Seek out Karuk at Riplash Strand.	Seek Out Karuk!	A fellow survivor of Pal'ea known as Karuk has made his way to the main base of the Kvaldir in the Borean Tundra - far to the south where the snow was once bountiful. Karuk hides along the bluffs overlooking Riplash Strand. Seek out Karuk and let him know what you did for my people here at the Coast of Echoes. The safest route to Karuk is through your fortress. From Warsong Hold, take the road south and follow it around until you reach Riplash Strand. 
Soo-nee wants you to use the Tempest Drums at the Stormwright's Shelf and help Haiphoon devour 3 Storm Revenants and 3 Aqueous Spirits.	Song of Wind and Water	Listen to storm, yes? The Stormwright's Shelf echoes with ancient song.... the Song of Wind and Water. The great tempest devours the sons of typhoons and storms. Take this drum and play his song... play Haiphoon's song. Help him feed on wind and water so tempest can continue. 
Report to Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering in Icecrown.	Vereth the Cunning	I've already heard some rumors regarding Malykriss and Arthas's new death knight order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though. We dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones. Try not to draw too much attention on your way in. 
Obtain Freya's trust by destroying 6 Blighted Corpses and 10 Bonescythe Ravagers in the Lost Lands.	An Issue of Trust	This should never have happened. The forces of undeath storm the very cradle of life! If you're not here to destroy the minions of the Lich King, then leave at once. Do not incur my wrath by distracting me from my duties. 
Travel to Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight and speak to Overlord Agmar.	Agmar's Hammer	Directly east of this refugee camp stands Agmar's Hammer - testament to the Hordes' power in the Dragonblight. While I have no doubt that our Horde brothers and sisters are already seeing the result of your efforts to bring the taunka into the Horde, I want you to deliver news of your success to Overlord Agmar in person. Go now, George! Race the winds! East to Agmar's Hammer! 
Report to the Ebon Watcher in the Valley of Echoes just outside the Breach.	Once More Unto The Breach, Hero	The Vanguard is secure, ally. We have reclaimed the Valley of Echoes and taken down the web walls blocking entry to the Breach. Now is the time to strike at Scourgeholme and establish our presence inside Icecrown. The battlefront moves on! I have asked the Ebon Watcher for his assistance with our assault upon Scourgeholme. His intimate knowledge of the Scourge will be invaluable in our effort. Go now and report to him at the tent outside of the Breach, northwest of here. 
Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to slay Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar.	No Rest For The Wicked	These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans! The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul. If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary. Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes from around their chamber and use his remains on the crystal there. Hurry, Human! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful! 
Travel to Venomspite in Dragonblight and speak with Chief Plaguebringer Middleton.	Imbeciles Abound!	The shipment from New Agamand was to arrive at Venomspite last week and then be delivered to me after some simple field tests. It is a Horde imperative - the last piece of the ""victory puzzle.""<Sintar sighs.>It is quite disheartening to know that you are surrounded by imbeciles and incompetent boobs! You must travel to Venomspite, near the eastern border of Dragonblight. Find that buffoon, Middleton, and let him know that I am waiting on the package. 
Use an Alliance Steam Tank to destroy 6 Plague Wagons and deliver the 7th Legion Elites to Wintergarde Mausoleum. Speak with Ambo Cash inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight should you succeed.	Steamtank Surprise	This is a seek and destroy mission. You'll be driving a tank into the Carrion Fields to dismantle Scourge plague wagons. With the tank comes a crew of three 7th Legion soldiers. All must survive if this mission is to succeed! You'll need to get in close to a plague wagon to unleash your engineer. Let them do their deed and move on to the next one. When the field is clear of plague wagons, head to the mausoleum in front of the ruined keep and drop off the rest of your crew. Meet with Ambo Cash inside. 
Karuk wants you to slay 6 Skadir Raiders and 5 Skadir Longboatsmen.	Karuk's Oath	They call themselves the Kvaldir. My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog. My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men. Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut. By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood. I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir. If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you. 
Request the aid of A'dal at Shattrath City in Terokkar Forest.	The Will of the Naaru	I appreciate everything that you have done for us, George. I have one last errand for you... one last gleaming hope for a paladin who deserves any salvation that we can extend. Go now to Shattrath and speak to the naaru, A'dal. He has long been a beacon of light and powerful ally to devout paladins. Impart Bridenbrad's story and seek any aid that he might have to offer. I cannot impress how important it is that you move quickly - I fear our crusader does not have much more time in this world. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use an Eye of Dominion to take control of a captured Eidolon Watcher.	Parting Gifts	Look what we have here... eyes of dominion. The Cult normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home. The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an undead minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton. Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade. 
Mage-Lieutenant Malister has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. Return to him at Westguard Keep when you have done so.	Sleeping Giants	I've overheard what you've had to say with Father Levariol. Allow me to suggest that he's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul. 
Use Steelring's Foolproof Dynamite to collect 6 Whisper Gulch Ore Fragments and 18 Whisper Gulch Gems. Then return them to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep.	Danger! Explosives!	George, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help. A bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in! The captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick. Get in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know! I gotta warn you though, that ore is strange! 
Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer wants you to bring him 5 Pustulant Spines from the Pustulant Horrors on Mord'rethar.	Against the Giants	While it's going to be crucial to defeat the Scourge on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself. The flesh giants on the ramparts are capable of hurling massive boulders and chunks of ice, inflicting devastating damage to enemy infantry below. Muster a force and defeat these giants. We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength. Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you. 
Zaza at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Karen the Culler.	The Culler Cometh	Near the southern end of this bluff is where you will find the treacherous leader of the caribou trappers. She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons! Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence. Prepare yourself properly, George. Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that Nesingwary has lavished upon her! 
Etaruk, on the outskirts of the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill Curator Insivius.	A Visit to the Curator	The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before. He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. George, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all. 
Go to the town hall building in Farshire and ring the bell inside of it.	Call to Arms!	Farshire has a fighting chance now, George. That's all we could've asked for and you've made it possible. All we need now is a rallying point. I'll have my men deliver the weapons to our town hall. Go and ring the town hall bell so any survivors know to rally there. It's time to show the Scourge what we're made of. 
Listen to Lok'lira the Crone's proposal.	The Hyldsmeet	Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first Hyldnir in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side. The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir. If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you. 
High Executor Wroth at Venomspite has tasked you with using the Rod of Compulsion on Commander Jordan, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut, Blacksmith Goodman, and Stable Master Mercer. Once the rod has been used on them, kill each to exact a denouncement of the Scarlet Onslaught as their final words.	The Denouncement	It's time for us to utterly demoralize the Onslaught forces! I want you to take the rod and use it on four of their leaders: Commander Jordan upstairs at the barracks, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut down the southeast ramp overlooking the beach, Blacksmith Goodman at the smithy, and Stable Master Mercer at the stables. Place them under the rod's compulsion, concentrate on making them denounce the Onslaught, and then kill them! 
Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord has asked that you bring him the Dragonflayer Battle Plans.	Dragonflayer Battle Plans	While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village. Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans. I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis! 
Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to use Zelig's Scrying Orb at the bottom of Frostmourne Cavern. Unlock the secrets of the past!	Frostmourne Cavern	They have labeled the cave as Frostmourne Cavern. Why the Scarlet Onslaught is interested in such things is unknown, but by the look of things, the area surrounding the cave is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must proceed! Take this scrying orb and travel north out of town and then northwest towards Scarlet Point. Make your way into the cave and battle your way to the bottom. Once there, use the orb. Return here with what you discover. 
Obtain Norgannon's Core.	The Core's Keeper	Prospector Soren's notes say that Norgannon's Core is in the keeping of a sentinel named Athan, one of Mimir's creations. Soren says the vault where Athan resides is called ""Loken's Bargain"" these days. Loken, eh? The earthen have mentioned him. The vault is said to be southwest of the ruined Explorers' League camp, with a round entrance on a mountainside overlooking the Valley of Ancient Winters. Find this Athan and get the core from him, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were in for a fight. 
Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker.	I'm Not Dead Yet!	The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off? 
The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to go to the Makers' Perch and use the Activation Switch Gamma.	Powering the Waygate - The Makers' Perch	It is time then. Let us activate the waygate. You will find the first switch inside the Makers' Perch in the western edge of the basin. Beware, George. The titans used the perch to watch over their creations. Many of their stone servants still guard the place. 
Speak to Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village.	Prepare for Glory	This is it then. I'll take care of your bear now, you won't be needing her. The great Drakkensryd will be your next challenge. Say goodbye to your friends and leave your affairs in order, for you will return victorious... or you won't return at all. 
Bring the Broken Shard of Horror, the Broken Shard of Despair, and the Broken Shard of Suffering to Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker.	Shatter the Shards	Atop the battlements of Corp'rethar, the Lich King's minions have erected three crystals, the shards of horror, despair, and suffering. Should our men reach the walls of Corp'rethar, he will unleash these weapons on our army. In full effect, the crystals will afflict the minds of our men with paralyzing pain and fear. Then, the Scourge will be able to slaughter them at will. Find these shards, destroy them, and bring me their broken remains. We cannot allow the Lich King to deploy these weapons! 
Speak with Toalu'u the Mystic at Moa'ki Harbor after you have attained your spiritual insight.	Spiritual Insight	Human, we have not heard from our people at Indu'le Village since the ground shook and was torn apart! Have you ever been upon a vision quest? You've bested Loguhn, so you must be capable. I will give you a special incense to sprinkle into my brazier. Breathe deep from its vapors and your spirit will be sent aloft to view what has transpired at Indu'le. As your spirit soars, I will be able to look through your eyes. 
Raider Captain Kronn wants you to slay 10 Alliance units or players at the Blackriver Logging Camp.	Blackriver Brawl	The Venture Company abandoned operations shortly after we showed up. Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides. With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs. Our war machine is a hungry beast... without renewing our supplies we won't make it to Icecrown. Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail. Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum. 
Slay the Drained Prophet of Quetz'lun and then inform Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga.	You Reap What You Sow	This is what it has come down to... revenge.<Har'koa sighs.>Take this ritual kit and enact it near Quetz'lun's corpse upon her altar. If everything works properly, her spirit should be drawn into the material world where she will be able to reclaim her power from the prophet. The rest will be up to you, George. You must slay the prophet in his drained state. 
Travel to Moa'ki Harbor in the Dragonblight and speak with Elder Ko'nani.	Travel to Moa'ki Harbor	Human, word just arrived from Moa'ki Harbor. Something very bad happened over there this morning! You've been very helpful to us here. Would you consider using the boat from Unu'pe to travel to the great Dragonblight? By the sound of things, Elder Ko'nani could certainly use your assistance. 
King Mrgl-Mrgl has asked you to rescue 20 Winterfin Tadpoles. Return to him at Winterfin Retreat once you have done so.	Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!	Oh good, you're back! When the landslide at the village across the water exposed the caverns, a malevolent lobstrok, known as Claximus, came out of the caves and stole the Winterfin tadpoles away. Something happened to all of the murlocs that followed him in there, and when they re-emerged, they were under his control. Mechanic, you must swim across the waters and rescue the Winterfin tadpoles in the village and caverns. The future of the Winterfin tribe depends upon you! 
Help Pilot Vic complete the Reconnaissance Flight.	Reconnaissance Flight	It's about time we had planes up and running in this place. The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast. Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory. No way in hell I'm heading out there alone. What do you say, <tough-guy/hotshot>? You might learn a thing or two. And once you learn to deal with the northern winds... you can pretty much fly anywhere. 
Father Gustav at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to use Holy Water on the corpses of Reanimated Crusaders to free 10 restless souls.	The Restless Dead	Not all of our soldiers made it out of Scourgeholme. Many were slain and turned into twisted reflections of their former selves. Such is the way of the Scourge. For those damned souls, there is no eternal peace. We must provide their souls rest. Travel through the Breach into Scourgeholme and slay the skeletal reanimated crusaders. Sprinkle this holy water on their bones so that their spirits may be freed. 
Hansel Bauer at Venomspite has asked you to steal 3 Onslaught Warhorses and deliver them to him, handing over the reins when you do so.	Fresh Remounts	Hello. I am Hansel. Pleased to meet you, <sir/ma'am>. The high executor came to me and said, 'Hansel, I want you to get us new mounts.'Where does he think dreadsteeds come from? The ground?<whispering> Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard. But we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses. Ride the horse back to me here and hand over the reins, if you would. 
King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat has asked you to bring him a Claw of Claximus.	Surrender... Not!	The time has come to put an end to this unnatural situation, George. For the Winterfin murlocs to have a chance at a future, Claximus must die! I want you to take my spare murloc suit and enter the Winterfin Caverns under the pretext of surrender. With the white flag in hand, the murlocs won't attack you. You'll find him in the southwestern most corner of the caverns. Once you get close enough, deal with Claximus. Bring me one of his claws as proof that the grisly deed has been done. 
Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you free 5 Webbed Crusaders.	Scourge Tactics	We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into Scourgeholme. Scourge opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and began raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers. Free our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, Mechanic! 
Astrid Bjornrittar, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears.	Into the Pit	Besting a tethered opponent is one thing. Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another. Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents. Good luck, sister. Glory awaits, should you succeed. 
Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch wants you to burn 7 Festering Corpses using Olakin's Torch.	By Fire Be Purged	The Scourge uses our own fallen against us, by raising them as ghouls or skeletons, or by dismembering their corpses and using the parts to make abominations. This must stop! The dead are heroes who fell in defense of all the living, and they cannot be confined to so grisly a fate. Moreover, we cannot afford to face them again on the field, used as weapons against us. Take this torch with you to the Fleshwerks, and burn any of the corpses you find in the Sanctum of Reanimation or the abomination lab. 
High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker wants you to go to the Broken Front and question a Dying Soldier, then report back to him.	The Broken Front	What?! Noooo! We went to such great pains to keep this attack secret. How could the Horde have known? The resources... the men... all lost? Inconceivable! Our plans here in Icecrown hinged upon our taking that gate before the Horde could. We must recover quickly and prepare to mount another offensive. Visit the battlefield and search for any survivors. See if there's anything to be learned from this tragedy. And prepare yourself, George, for a war - on two fronts... 
Bring the Stinger of the Sapphire Queen to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill. If you lose Dajik's Worn Chalk, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	The Sapphire Queen	Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar. Wasps on other hand not fear the Frenzyheart... they even kill some of our hunters. I know Rakjak want wasp queen dead, but no wolvar want to go into her hive. You go kill wasp queen in Sapphire Hive to southeast and get stinger for Rakjak. Me bet Rakjak like that. 
Capture 6 Orgrim's Hammer Dispatches from Orgrim's Hammer Scouts and bring them to High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker.	Get the Message	The Horde is up to something and I don't like it. After the stunt they pulled on the Broken Front, they're capable of anything, and it's up to us to stop it. There's been a flurry of activity in the skies over the Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. Horde scouts and messengers streak in and out on dragonhawks, carrying reports and orders. Take this dart gun and use it to kill the Orgrim's Hammer Scouts. It'll probably work best if you're flying, too. 
Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the remains of 6 Skeletal Reavers.	Before the Gate of Horror	The Conflagration, the ground before Corp'rethar, south of the Ironwall Rampart, is where the Lich King's elite soldiers have formed up to defend the citadel. Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us. I've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers. 
Gretta the Arbiter, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Icemaw Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears.	Back to the Pit	To truly stay in your best riding shape you'll want to test yourself against the other Hyldnir every day. Head back into the Pit of the Fang and show them what you're capable of. They'll appreciate suffering defeat to one as skilled as yourself. 
Kill Archbishop Landgren and then summon Arete's Gate in the presence of his corpse. Speak with Lord-Commander Arete inside The Crimson Cathedral once he's completed his questioning of the archbishop's spirit.	Second Chances	I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help. We still need to know where the grand admiral is, but this time we're not taking any chances! Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop. I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul! We will find Grand Admiral Westwind! 
	Reading the Bones	 
Elder Shaman Moky at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Rageclaw Fire Extinguisher to douse 15 hut fires at Rageclaw Den.	This Just In: Fire Still Hot!	Trolls attack Rageclaw Den and kick Rageclaw out! It get worse. Trolls now burning village! This very bad. Chief make top Rageclaw shaman, Moky, do study on fire. Results very surprising! Fire still hot and can burn things. Will you help Rageclaw and put fire out? Moky has special Rageclaw fire extinguisher for you. Use special fire extinguisher to put out fire at Rageclaw Den to southeast. Sometimes take many sprays to douse fire, but extinguisher always have water! Rageclaw magic strong! 
Matthias Lehner at Sindragosa's Fall wants you to obtain 6 Whelp Bone Dusts.	Where Dragons Fell	A whole brood of blue dragons fell here. And now, one by one, they're being raised by his servants. He raised the biggest of them all himself. Bring me some bone dust from the whelps and I'll show you exactly how he did it. 
Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to collect 1 Ruby Lilac.	In Search of the Ruby Lilac	How fortuitous it is that the Ruby Dragonshrine lays just to the east. It is there that you will find a flower called the ruby lilac. This lifegiving plant is all that I need to concoct a vaccine for the untainted beasts of this region. Travel east and search the Ruby Dragonshrine for the lilac. Just one thing: The dragonshrine, like all the dragonshrines in this blasted wasteland, is beset by the Scourge. Watch your step. We wouldn't want you to be devoured by an emberwyrm.<Sintar laughs.> 
Locate Dregmar Runebrand near his cave on the path to the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn. Challenge him and uncover the name of the magnataur leader by any means necessary. Return to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple once the information is obtained.	Reclusive Runemaster	Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster... a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in Dragonblight for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is. It is unlikely we will gain any aid with the increasing concerns with the Scourge and the blue flight, so I need you to procure the information from Dregmar by any means necessary. I was told he can be found amongst the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn. 
Speak with Squire Danny to summon your opponent. Once you have defeated the Argent Champion, return to Colosos at the Argent Tournament Grounds. If you lose your lance, you can get another from any of the Lance Racks near the stables or in the Silver Covenant Pavilion.	The Valiant's Challenge	You are nearly ready to compete on behalf of the Exodar in the grand melee. To prove yourself worthy to enter the lists on behalf of our city, you must defeat a champion of the Argent Crusade. Go to the stables outside the pavilion, equip your lance, and mount up. Speak to Squire Danny at the Argent Valiants' Ring on the western edge of the grounds. The squire will call out your opponent when you're ready. After the battle is concluded, we will speak of the outcome. 
Charge the Dormant Polished Crystal at the exposed Lifeblood Pillar. Travel to Sparktouched Haven and use the power the crystal bestows to slaughter 30 of the nearby Frenzyheart wolvar, and then speak to Lightningcaller Soo-met in Sparktouched Haven.	Power of the Great Ones	We need to do something to stop puppy-men attacking Sparktouched Haven. Jaloot brought me very special crystal that he found in River's Heart... we seen only one like it before. The crystal not have power now, but the opened up lifeblood pillar should have energy to recharge it if you just bring it close. Once the crystal is charged, go to Sparktouched Haven in far southwest and let the crystal's energy make you big and strong. Then it time to kick some puppy-men butt. 
Use Gavrock's Runebreaker to free 4 Runed Giants, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys.	Free at Last	The rock shard you imbued should be powerful enough to break the runic magic binding my brothers. Take it with you and find the runed giants walking north along the Eastwind Shore. Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results. If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves. If the stone fails to work, the giants may attack in a weakened state. But, what choice do we have? If we do not try, they will remain enslaved without hope. 
Medic Hawthorn, outside of Valiance Keep, wants you to go inside the Stormbreaker's hold and retrieve Hawthorn's Anti-Venom from a crate of First Aid Supplies.	A Soldier in Need	You there! Please, I need your help. This soldier will succumb to the cryptfiends' venom unless we act immediately. I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it. I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south. Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies. Hurry, Mechanic! We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily. 
Investigate the nearby voice in Naz'anak, the Forgotten Depths.	A Voice in the Dark	The object is not a crystal at all, but some form of organ, encased in ice. As you touch it, your hand reels in horrible pain. You feel as if your hand has been cut, yet there is no visible wound. As you collect your thoughts, you hear a young boy's voice nearby.""You really shouldn't have done that."" 
Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Nifflevar while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Nifflevar.	Anguish of Nifflevar	All that we know of the vrykul indicates that they only recently appeared in Northrend. Why, then, are we seeing vrykul in visions that date back 15,000 years? Surely if the vrykul had previously existed in Northrend we would have known. You must press on to Nifflevar. To get there you must go northeast, through Wyrmskull Village, and take the path leading up through the dam. Nifflevar is on the bluffs of the fjord. Use the incense burner once you arrive at Nifflevar and search the area for clues. 
Bring a Shattertusk Mammoth to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost.	A Mammoth Undertaking	Before you go off challenging Broodmother Slivina, Dorian thought it might be a good idea for you and Hemet to coordinate your efforts by riding into battle on the back of a mammoth. The area around the camp is full of them. Just take this bridle and slip it over the head of a shattertusk mammoth. Be careful of the bulls, though. They won't tolerate the harness at all. Bring the mammoth back here when you've found a suitable one. 
Foreman Mortuus at Warsong Hold wants you to free 5 Warsong Peons.	Taken by the Scourge	<Mortuus sighs.>Peons... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal. See, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a leper gnome. Of course they're the first to be taken by the Scourge! This puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction. Find and release my peons, Human. If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout Mightstone Quarry. 
Bethod Feigr in The Underhalls wants you to throw down his sword to challenge Thane Illskar and then kill him in The Circle of Suffering.	Revenge for the Vargul	I've been praying to The Lady of the Sword for one to come and strike down my enemy. Thane Illskar must pay for what he did to me! I was the champion of Thane Ufrang the Mighty. During my fight for ascendance in Valhalas, Illskar sabotaged me with dark magic, causing me to lose and be reduced to this. The thane and his champions can be found below in The Circle of Suffering. Challenge him on my behalf. Defeat him. Make him know the suffering that I know! 
Speak with Squire David to summon your opponent. Once you have defeated the Argent Valiant, return to Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Aspirant's Challenge	You have trained hard as an aspirant, George, and now the time has come to test your mounted combat skills against an experienced opponent. Equip your lance, then go to the stables outside the pavilion and mount the Sunreaver hawkstrider. At the Aspirants' Ring on the northern side of the tournament grounds, you'll find a human child called Squire David. He'll ask if you're ready for the fight and call out your opponent. Good luck, George. May your mount be steady and your aim true. 
Speak with Justicar Mariel Trueheart at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	A Champion Rises	You have earned my respect and the respect of your peers. You defeated all who challenged you and mastered the ways of tournament combat. I have no doubt that you are ready to face down the champions of other cities for the glory of Orgrimmar! Justicar Mariel Trueheart has asked to speak with you, George, and to formally enter you in the champions' grand melee. 
Use the Bag of Jagged Shards near one of the bottom level Malykriss furnaces. Return to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch with the Smelted Metal Bar.	I'm Smelting... Smelting!	<Olakin turns one of the shards over in an armored fist.>These could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the Lich King intends to do with them. To the east, nestled next to Icecrown Citadel itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces on the bottom level of Malykriss. Once the metal has been reformed, we can identify it. 
Sage Edan and Camp Winterhoof wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.	March of the Giants	To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination. The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants. Take this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings. 
Njormeld wants you to accompany Snorri to Fjorn's anvil and help him kill 10 Seething Revenants.	Battling the Elements	Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club. We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle. Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, Human. Guide him against this enemy. 
Investigate a Summoning Altar in the eastern part of the Fleshwerks, then report back to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.	Where Are They Coming From?	The Lich King's tireless minions labor away night and day to assemble scores of abominations and flesh giants down there in the Fleshwerks. Yet, that is not enough. More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work. If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons. 
High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing wants you to take the Burning Torch and use it to burn 10 of the corpses littered to the west of town.	War is Hell	We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast. The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been. This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives. In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time. Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen. 
Handsome Terry at Scalawag Point wants you to bring him 1 Amani Vase and 1 Eagle Figurine from the shipwreck to the south.	Forgotten Treasure	I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces. Black Conrad's fleet sank south of here years ago. All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there. One is a museum-quality Amani vase, the other is an eagle figurine. Go and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates. I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable. 
Bring 4 Dark Armor Samples to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.	Armor of Darkness	This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade. Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems? Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems. 
Speak with Gryphon Commander Urik to secure a ride to Thorson's Post. Report to Duke August Foehammer when you arrive at Thorson's Post in Dragonblight.	Into Hostile Territory	You have done much to advance our efforts against the Scourge, George. In fact, the morale of all those who have come into contact with you soars! Such is your influence over the soldiers and citizenry of Wintergarde, ally. And because of you we are now prepared to go on the offensive! You are to report to Duke August Foehammer, across the Carrion Fields at Thorson's Post, east of here. Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station has prepared a special gryphon to drop you behind enemy lines. Go now! 
An Injured Goblin Miner in Crystalweb Cavern wants you to bring back an Icetip Venom Sac from an Icetip Crawler.	Only Partly Forgotten	Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach. I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored. Ricket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming. I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone. 
Use Brann's Communicator to contact Brann Bronzebeard and find out what to do next.	Pieces of the Puzzle	We've seen the iron dwarves and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the earthen, along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master. 
Kill 60 Game Animals while you aid Hemet and his companions in their hunting. When you've killed your 60, return to Drostan at the Nesingwary Base Camp to compare numbers.	The Great Hunter's Challenge	So y'have something of a hunter's instinct. You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt. How'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you? Hemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck! 
You are to return to Dun Niffelem and ask Calder about the piece of Everfrost.	Everfrost	This piece of ice has been submitted to immense pressures and exposed to natural magics from deep beneath the world's surface. In combination, these effects have yielded an ice that will never melt. Knowing little of these things, you resolve to bring the sample back to Dun Niffelem. Someone there is bound to be familiar with its properties. 
Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to slay 10 Coldarra Spellweavers.	Basic Training	This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear. Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the aspect Malygos and his entire blue dragonflight. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more. We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy. Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you. 
Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to disrupt the iron dwarves' work by throwing boulders into the exposed area of Thor Modan.	Raining Down Destruction	Beneath us is iron's ancient bastion, Thor Modan. Thousands of years ago, the stone giants tore the land asunder, collapsing part of the city and exposing much of the rest. Even now, the iron dwarves attempt to reclaim their old capital, but we will not permit it. My giants fill the trench with boulders and debris, hoping to seal it off and kill the servants of iron as they work. Take up the boulders you see near the trench to the northeast, and help us put an end to their efforts. 
Foreman Colbey at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Shatterhorn.	The Yeti Next Door	Maybe if the sentries won't help me, you will? I'm the foreman of the mine just across the bridge. My men are mining ore for the weapons our expeditionary force will need to carve a path into the Grizzly Hills. A giant yeti has invaded the mine, blocking the tunnel we need to expand! We've tried yelling at him and smoking him out, but nothing's worked. Maybe you could rouse it from its sleep with a meal of meat from the frosthorn rams in the snowy areas around town? Please? We're desperate! 
Speak with Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault.	The Duke	We need you focused, George. We're barely holding The Shadow Vault as it is. As you can see, we've greatly angered the Lich King.<The baron chuckles.>I need you to speak with Duke Lankral. He's in charge here now. You'll find him inside the vault building proper. Were I you, I would not keep him waiting. 
""Hacksaw"" Jenny in New Agamand wants you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Ligaments and 1 Fresh Pound of Flesh.	Parts for the Job	So Harris wants a demolition job, eh? Yeah, I can help out. You're gonna have to get me some parts, though. I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up. First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments... way better than the human kind. I will also need a pound of flesh. A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat. He travels up and down the road to the west. 
Glorthal Stiffbeard at Frosthold wants you to kill Sirana Iceshriek.	Sirana Iceshriek	This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards. One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here. Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done. 
Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le. Then, head east to the Azure Dragonshrine near south central Dragonblight and observe what is occurring there from the western ledgeAfterward, return to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.	The End of the Line	Within his robes you find two things of interest. One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens. The fragile water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine. Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge. 
Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Unholy Gem on Duke Vallenhal and return to him with a Filled Unholy Gem.	In Service of the Unholy	The power of the unholy is coveted among my kind. It makes up the very fiber of our existence, granting death to those that dare make a mockery of it! Thankfully there is a font from which I may draw from in my time of need. Take this unholy gem and make your way to the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of here. It is there that you will find Duke Vallenhal, death knight of Arthas. Weaken his resolve in battle and unleash the power of the gem upon him. It will finish him off and steal his unholy energy! 
Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron. Should you manage to do so, return to Camp Winterhoof and report your success to Chieftain Ashtotem.	The Slumbering King	A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below. However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron. If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late. 
Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to save 8 Injured 7th Legion Soldiers.	The Chain Gun And You	We've set up chain guns and barricades directly to the east and to the west. Our injured soldiers are hiding in both rooms - trying their best to not alert the mindless ghouls to their presence. Now that we have ammo, I need you to man one of the chain guns and use it to blast a path clear for our soldiers! Once you're on board, call a soldier out from hiding and then lay down heavy fire to keep the Scourge off him! Get a move on! 
Donathan ordered you to offer your assistance to Librarian Normantis in the mage tower on Amber Ledge.	The Borean Inquisition	Listen closely, George, for there is not a moment to spare. Your prisoner is being prepared for interrogation here in our tower. In the event that he is less than forthcoming, your assistance may be required. Make your way up to where he is being detained and tell Librarian Normantis that I've sent you to assist him. 
Speak with the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.	Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest	Mechanic, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Stars' Rest with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives. Stars' Rest is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. There is an archmage there named Modera. She will be expecting you. 
Brann Bronzebeard wants you to meet him at the Temple of Invention and help him combine Norgannon's Shell and Norgannon's Core. Once you have helped Brann, report back to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.	Forging the Keystone	Aha! Here it is: the Temple of Invention, the seat of Keeper Mimir himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key. According to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the Terrace of the Makers. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site. I'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together. 
Darkspeaker R'khem in the Saronite Mines wants you to recover the Foreman's Key to his chains.	Mind Tricks	<The creature speaks directly into your mind, its thoughts painful and strange.>Human-thing, I am in need of your assistance. Like your enslaved friends, I am a victim of the Lich King's ymirjar and their avarice. When I rose from below to investigate the noises coming from this cavern they captured and chained me. Will you please help me? The foreman of these mines holds the key to my chains. Kill him!<You can feel a pushing against your mind as if the creature is trying to coerce you.> 
Speak to Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village.	Lok'lira's Parting Gift	You've been a great ally, George. Now comes your true test. You will need skill, courage and a little luck.<Lok'lira attaches a thin strand of hair to yours.>You cannot fail now sister. Speak to Gretta the Arbiter. She'll see you on your way. 
The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to bring him 15 Scourgestones.	The Scourgestone	A Scourgestone is an item given to all Scourge upon birth or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it allows Scourge leaders visibility into the location and movement of all of their units. With enough Scourgestones, I might be able to track the movement of other Scourge units across Icecrown. As you slaughter Scourge in Scourgeholme, gather all of the Scourgestones that you find. Return to me when your bags are full. 
Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.	The Rune of Command	Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation. Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered. The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run. 
Get Venture Co. Explosives from any of the Venture Company units at Swindlegrin's Dig and use them to obtain a Stormwatcher's Head. Bring the Stomwatcher's Head to Rejek at Frenzyheart Hill.	A Hero's Headgear	Rejek hears tales of giant metal men on faraway Stormwright's Shelf. Far to northwest, outside basin's lip, you will find it. Imagine Rejek using heads of giant metal men as helmet. Make Rejek unstoppable! Make Rejek mighty! You get for Rejek, but metal head might not come off metal body easy. Maybe steal bombs from little green men and their friends at Swindlegrin's Dig near Suntouched Pillar? Use bombs to get head off metal body, then bring to Rejek. 
Escort Bonker Togglevolt to safety and then report in with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip.	Get Me Outa Here!	I knew they'd send someone for me sooner or later... turned out to be later, of course. I came in here to parlay with the snobolds, but their main shaman, Kaganishu, decided instead that I'd make a tasty snack for Magmothregar. Wait... what?! They didn't send you?!DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ME?!Okay, you're here now and that's all that matters. As soon as you break this chain we'll make our way back to the airstrip. Then you can tell Fizzcrank I'm safely back. If he remembers me, that is. 
Crusader Silverdawn wants you to bring peace to 6 Fallen Hero's Spirits.	The Fate Of The Fallen	The Argent Crusade is hardly the first force to challenge the Lich King. Our enemy turns spirits of the fallen against us. Their spirits wander the Valley of Fallen Heroes, southwest of the grounds and between Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. The area is littered with discarded soul crystals, used by the Scourge to control the spirits. Gather those soul crystals and use them with this Light-blessed relic to bestow the blessing of peace upon the spirits. They have more than earned their rest. 
Zepik wants you to kill 12 Mistwhisper Gorlocs. If you lose Zepik's Hunting Horn, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	The Mist Isn't Listening	Gorillas and wasps are boring! Big-tongues the only thing fun to hunt. While we mess up rain shrine, we kill lots of mist big-tongues. That sure to make them not want to come back to village thing.<Zepik nods to himself confidently.> 
Show the Alliance Missive to Palena Silvercloud at Stars' Rest.	Of Traitors and Treason	The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of Dragonblight. If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic. Hurry, George. Show the document to Palena Silvercloud here at Stars' Rest and explain the nature of your mission. She will put you on her fastest hippogryph to Wintergarde! 
Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise wants you to fill the Gore Bladder with the blood of 10 Ravenous Jaws.	Blood in the Water	The forces at Onslaught Harbor are heavily reinforced by gryphon riders. You need a mount that will enable you to put them down. But first, we need the components for the ritual that is going to make it all happen. A great deal of blood is necessary for the ritual to be undertaken.<The lord-commander points down and to the northwest.>There is a readily available supply down there in the harbor... sharks. Do not return to me until you've filled this bladder with their blood. 
Speak with ""Silvermoon"" Harry at Scalawag Point about the missing Vrykul artifacts.	"Street ""Cred"""	The Northsea Freebooters all fear and respect Grezzix. I'm thinking they recognize my special talents and envy my amazing ship. All you need to do is tag along with my cabin boy, Lou, and you'll be in like... In like tin. Pirates love tin. Just talk to Lou when you're ready to go and he'll take you to Scalawag. Oh yea, you'll want to talk to ""Silvermoon"" Harry first. He'll have more information on the stuff they pilfered. Just watch what you say around him. He's a freak... crazy for blood elves. 
Karuk wants you to defeat Gamel the Cruel at Riplash Strand.	Gamel the Cruel	My own father was slain by the leader of this raiding party, Gamel the Cruel. He has made his abode inside a cave on the beach. You've dealt with his men already. Finish what you've started, George. Avenge my father and I will share with you what little I still have. 
Veehja in Riplash wants you to go to the far northeastern end of the Riplash Ruins. Once there slay Ragnar Drakkarlund and obtain the Trident of Naz'jan from him.	The Trident of Naz'jan	Five hundred years ago, Azshara imprisoned a being named Leviroth in the waters below. Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work! They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him! When they ran out of naga, they began to take tuskarr. Their spirits will know no peace! I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance. Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash. He has in his possession a golden trident. Bring it to me! 
Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 Skybreaker Recon Fighters, then report back to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer.	Blinding the Eyes in the Sky	The Alliance has somehow managed to field a squadron of recon vehicles over the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, the broad areas west of Aldur'thar. They cannot be permitted to take the lead in this fight. Chief Engineer Copperclaw has supplied me with the perfect weapon to deal with this threat -- he calls his new missile the SGM-3. I have his assurances that it will take out the Alliance flying machines in a single hit. Go and use this weapon to give us the upper hand. 
Bring the Scintillating Fragment to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield.	Puzzling...	Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside. Perhaps Raelorasz might be able to shed some light on its purpose. 
Return the Shield of the Aesirites to Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in the Howling Fjord.	The Shield of the Aesirites	Here's yer shield. Me hopes it doesn't curse ye like it did me'n'me crew. Ye don't have to go home, but ye can't stay here... I be certain that thar be some that would be interested in getting' it back. Now get that thing off me ship! 
Father Gustav at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you bring him 10 Forgotten Depths Venom Sacs.	Curing The Incurable	The number of injured soldiers rises with each passing day. They are being stricken by some type of toxin that we have never before seen. Whatever it is that these Nerubians hold within their venom glands is lethal and incurable! So far we've only been able to slow down the poison flowing through the victim's bodies. We must devise a cure! Venture northwest to the valley outside of the Vanguard and slay the Forgotten Depths Nerubians. Recover their venom glands and bring them to me. 
Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Incendiary Explosives to collapse the sinkholes southwest and northwest of Valiance Keep.	Plug the Sinkholes	The Scourge are showing no sign of letting up, George. It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to tunnels all the way to Icecrown for all we know. Giant undead worms burrow under the ground to create them. If there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion. Take these explosives and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes up on the ridge beyond the beach to the west. Come back after you've collapsed them. 
Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to collect 3 Glacial Splinters and 3 Magic-Bound Splinters from the Ancients in Coldarra.	Secrets of the Ancients	It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures. I've taken a particular interest in the Glacial Ancients and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these 'Magic-bound' Ancients may hold clues to our predicament here. For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry.... 
The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village wants you to defeat Iskalder upon Battlescar Spire.	Not-So-Honorable Combat	Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking Jotunheim is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the vrykul, second only to Valhalas in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat. We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it. Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder. We will fight, you will win, and Vardmadra is sure to come to witness the battle! 
Find Shadowstalker Getry at Warsong Farms.	Get to Getry	The Scourge agent that's overseeing the abduction and transformation of Horde soldiers into undead monsters is using the northwest farm as a spawning glade. Shadowstalker Getry has been staking out that monster for the past week and has gathered some vital information that might allow us to end this menace. Get to Getry and see if you can help him put a stop to this Scourge assembly line. You'll find Getry at the abandoned tower on the northwest border of these farms. 
Thassarian at the Wailing Ziggurat in Borean Tundra wants you to inflict 20 casualties against the Scourge inside the Temple City of En'kilah. Use Lurid's Bones if you need assistance.	Buying Some Time	Now that we have this phylactery, I shouldn't have any problems getting the information I need. It won't take long for the Scourge in the Temple City to notice something's up, however. I won't be able to fend off a full scale attack here. Or maybe I would... but I'd rather not find out. I want you to head down there and inflict some casualties. Hopefully they'll be distracted long enough for these two to spill their guts... figuratively, of course. Take Lurid with you, he might be of aid. 
Report to the Warsong Recruitment Officer at Warsong Hold in Borean Tundra.	Warchief's Command: Borean Tundra!	All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to the Warsong Recruitment Officer at Warsong Hold. The Warsong Offensive needs your help to overcome the continued threat from the undead Scourge. Take the zeppelin to Warsong Hold from Orgrimmar's western zeppelin tower and present yourself to the recruitment officer. Destiny calls! 
Use the Bundle of Vrykul Artifacts at the ransacked burial mounds of Shield Hill to return the Frozen Heart of Isuldof, the Shield of the Aesirites, the Staff of Storm's Fury and the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir. Return to Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift should you succeed.	A Return to Resting	<Orfus hands you a satchel.>Within this satchel are the artifacts that you recovered. Locate the burial mounds of Shield Hill, far to the southeast, where the items were originally stolen from and return the artifacts. It is my hope that this gesture will quell the spirits that now haunt our hunting grounds. Be strong, George... 
Collect 5 Winterfin Clams and deliver them to Ahlurglgr at Winterfin Retreat.	Winterfin Commerce	Now that you can speak with the Winterfin, it is time for you to let them get to know you. One of the best ways to do that is to conduct business with them. The murlocs prize clams over any other object and their only surviving merchant is Ahlurglgr. If I were you, I'd collect a handful of Winterfin clams and give them to him as a gift. The clams can be found all over down in the trench, as well as across it in the Winterfin village and their caverns. 
Speak to Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael in the battlefield at the Bleeding Vale south of Vengeance Landing. Return to High Executor Anselm when you've completed this task.	Reports from the Field	Our mission in Northrend is to destroy Arthas. The Alliance are but an obstacle that we'll crush wherever we find them. We've managed to destroy their easternmost fleet; but the survivors have barricaded themselves on the Derelict Strand, south of here. Our forces should've overwhelmed their make-shift defenses long ago, but we underestimated their will to live. Seek my officers in the field, Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael and get them to report on the situation. 
Zepik wants you to smash the Skyreach Crystal Clusters in front of the Mistwhisper weather shrine. If you lose Zepik's Hunting Horn, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	Lightning Definitely Strikes Twice	Okay, the crystal things...The big-tongues use the crystals to power their rain shrines. Zepik not know quite how it works, but Zepik does know that if they use wrong crystals, the clouds and the rain go crazy! Zepik tried to sneak in at one of their other rain shrines, but it not go so well. It sure to go much better with two! Take crystals, place at big stone pillar shrine thing, then smash them to release power. Zepik not sure what will happen, so might want to step back after. 
Recover the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.	The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir	I was on the vessel that was bringing in the armor. We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a Forsaken destroyer. They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her. That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from Scalawag to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, Alanya, outside. She'll get you on the bomber. If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back! 
Speak with Torastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.	Galakrond and the Scourge	Atop the Wicked Coil, the Grand Necrolord of the Scourge, Antiok, sits upon the shoulders of the reconstructed storm giant lord, Thiassi. From there he commands the armies of undead to work day and night to unearth Galakrond's massive bones. Should they succeed in raising Galakrond, all of your efforts will have been for naught. While I cannot call down the full fury of the Red Dragonflight to assist you in your journey, I will grant you my blessing. Go now and speak with my majordomo, Torastrasza. 
Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown with the Emerald Acorn.	The Boon of Remulos	I shall open a portal to take you back to the druid that brought you here. You and your crusader have my well wishes. I hope that this acorn is able to purify your crusader and save him from the wretched fate of the plague. Farewell, Human. 
	Congratulations!	 
Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep has tasked you with the destruction of 3 Proto-Drakes.	Two Wrongs...	Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do. I hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless. Take my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake's attention. 
Put to rest any combination of 15 Indu'le Fishermen, Mystics and Warriors, then return to Elder Mana'loa at Indu'le Village.	Freedom for the Lingering	The sacred ground of the elves to the west has been torn asunder. Now their magic is moving through the land causing ruin where it flows. The souls of the Kalu'ak are in danger as the blue dragons forces attempt to control the magic. The power came up through the lake, instantly slaying most in the village. Those that survived were driven insane. George, you must release these spirits so that they may move on. Leave the deranged living alone; they may yet regain their sanity in time. 
Travel to the Lifeblood Pillar and look for clues to its destruction.	The Fallen Pillar	The titans shaped entire life forms here, fostering their unfettered growth. The five crystal pillars that surround the basin emanate pure lifeforce. The Scourge should've never been able to penetrate the basin, but one of the pillars was destroyed. Go to the Lifeblood Pillar and see if you can find out what happened. No undead would've been able to approach the pillar, so keep your eyes out for living intruders. You'll find what remains of the pillar directly south of here. 
Assist Kaz'tik the Manipulator as he unearths his greatest weapon.	Reunited	You look at me and see I am no great warrior. Why was I chosen to be a Paragon? Not all weapons can be seen, Wakener. One should not judge by appearance alone. Before I explain further, I need to know that you are trustworthy. Something precious to me was hidden at the time of my preservation. I am nothing without it. Defend me as I unearth my greatest weapon, and you will have my trust. 
Astrid Bjornrittar wants you to slay 8 Ravenous Jormungar in the Hibernal Cavern east of Brunnhildar Village.	The Slithering Darkness	The vile jormungar have taken over most of the Hibernal Cavern. They are despicable beings... children of Loken, Thorim's scumsucker of a brother. As Thorim's servants we owe it to ourselves to kill these scum where we find them. You'll find the cavern just east of here, outside the village. 
Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to use the Disciplining Rod on 6 Exhausted Vrykul inside the Forlorn Mine.	Maintaining Discipline	You've succeeded where others have failed. Yet you cannot rest on your laurels. You must show others what strength and commitment really mean. The male insubordinates inside the Forlorn Mine need to be disciplined once again. Show them sister... show them what it means to disobey us. 
Nishera the Garden Keeper at the Emerald Dragonshrine has asked you to slay 5 Emerald Skytalons.	Cycle of Life	Ysera sleeps in the Emerald Dream, watching over both the Dream and Azeroth. But a horrible nightmare has taken hold in the Dream, and now I fear that Ysera is being affected by it. Recently, I asked her to aid in the fight against the Scourge that are raising frostwyrms at the other dragonshrines. She misunderstood. Instead, she told our dragonshrine's defenders to treat those not of the green dragonflight as enemies. I need you to slay some of the skytalons. The shrine must regain its balance. 
Sergei at Silverbrook wants you to slay 8 Conquest Hold Marauders.	Northern Hospitality	It's good to meet you. Let us celebrate our pact by partaking in some good old fashioned Horde-killing. You'll find marauders from Conquest Hold just outside our town, west of here. Why don't you head out there and hunt them like the filthy animals they are? Let's see if our new allies can back all their talk with some action. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use the Eidolon Watcher to feed 18 Hungering Plaguehounds.	An Undead's Best Friend	As is usual practice, the undead at the saronite quarry to the southwest starve plaguehounds to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them. Don't get too close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness. 
Blast Thunderbomb in Ymirheim wants you to use his Thunderbomb's Jumpbot to plant the Horde Battle Standard in the skulls at the top of the mountain.	King of the Mountain	Yo, George, I need you to get my jumpbot to the top of this mountain to the southeast, like yesterday! That girly, self-righteous Frazzle Geargrinder thinks that her jumpbot's better than mine. Hah! We're in a race to see who's gonna be king of the mountain! Once you jump up there, plant our battle standard in the pile of bones and show everyone that the Horde, and my mad engineering skills, are the best! 
Speak to Karuk at Riplash Strand, southwest of Valiance Keep.	A Diplomatic Mission	I see that you are very eager to help, George. You didn't come all the way to Northrend to stay holed up in a city! I've just the task for you... something that'll take you far away from here. We've long sought to gain the favor of the tuskarr native to Northrend. Recently a young tuskarr came to us seeking help, something we couldn't offer at the time. Now that you're around, maybe you can lend him a hand. Look for Karuk near the Riplash Strand, southwest of here, and see what you can do to help. 
Take Mildred's Key to Lok'lira the Crone in the Forlorn Mine.	A Certain Prisoner	You are without mercy. You will do well around these parts. I have another task to ask of you. There is a female vrykul prisoner that's become more of a liability than I had anticipated. She had the gall to claim the right to take part in the Hyldsmeet, our sacred competition of strength and fighting prowess. Here's the key to her shackles. Make it as painless as possible. She's a female after all, even if not one of us. 
Scuttle Frostprow wants you to obtain Big Roy's Blubber as the main ingredient for her magic swabbin' soap. Return to her on the eastern pirate ship at Scalawag Point when you have it.	Swabbin' Soap	Yeah, I got to get the deck swabbed spotless afore Mad Jonah comes 'round. An' I ain't gonna do it on my hands and knees neither! Problem is, we're all outa soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I gots a special trip for ya to make. Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen! 
Use the Death's Gaze Orb to place orbs on the Abomination Lab Orb Stand, the Flesh Giant Lab Orb Stand, and the Cauldron Area Orb Stand, then return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.	Death's Gaze	The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan.<Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you.>This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike. Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west. 
Bring 1 piece of Coal and 5 Simple Flour to Hidetrader Jun'ik at Conquest Hold in Grizzly Hills.	Jun'ik's Coverup	Ah, we have a small problem. Grizzly hides... they be brown, mon! Think... think! I got it, mon! Is like this: gray is black an' white all mixed up. You get me some coal an' some flour, I'll grind it all up and dust the hides with it. No one will know the better! Blacksmiths sell coal for smeltin' an' you can get flour from the provisioner. 
Speak with Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.	The Steward of Wyrmrest Temple	You've proved that you're to be trusted and more. You should return to Wyrmrest Temple and speak with the steward, Tariolstrasz, once more, George. 
The Leaper at The Shadow Vault wants you to duel and defeat Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun and Tinky Wickwhistle.	Eliminate the Competition	Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr...<The Leaper clears his throat.>Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is. I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the Savage Ledge, over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there. Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the vrykul. 
Drakuru wants you to go to the uppermost chamber at Blue Sky Logging Ground and find the Heart of the Ancients.	Heart of the Ancients	Secrets of da ages, be revealed to me now!<Drakuru peers through the Eye of the Prophets.>Ahh, great be mah destiny, George. You be lucky ta know me....There! I be seein' it, mon. The Heart of the Ancients. Dis be too easy! You gunna find da heart lyin' near da corpse of a goblin east of here. He be up in a chamber, near a river of broken trees. Hurry, mon, before someone else be findin' it! 
Use the Shard of the Earth to rally the Grizzly Hills Giants fighting in the Boulder Hills, kill any iron dwarves who oppose you, then report to Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan.	Rallying the Troops	The sons of iron have used their runes to enthrall many of my brothers and are using them to break the siege on Thor Modan. I wish we did not have to fight them, but we have no choice. My giants will not hold out long against them. I have imbued this earthen shard with a blessing that will aid our allies. Take it with you to the battle in the Boulder Hills to the north, and use it to reassure and fortify my brethren. Kill any iron dwarves who would stand in your way. 
Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to kill 10 Stormforged Invaders.	Unwelcome Guests	Our scouts have spotted iron dwarves in the valley north of here. I overheard King Stormheart sending you to visit Drom and I'm admittedly a bit worried about'm. If you find any iron dwarves when you head down there, put'm down hard and fast for me, eh? I dun think they know exactly where we are or how to get here just yet, and I'd prefer to keep it that way. 
Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to kill Coprous the Defiled at Mord'rethar.	Coprous the Defiled	Reports of a powerful zombie at the death gate have reached my ears, Mechanic. We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now. Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit. 
Commander Falstaav at The Argent Stand has asked you to equip 10 Argent Crusaders or Argent Shieldmen out in the courtyard with parachutes.	Parachutes for the Argent Crusade	Those sky terrors are destroying my men and women! Dying from falling is a horrible way to go. Mechanic, you have to get these parachutes out to them! At least then they'll have a fighting chance to survive. 
Bring Farunn's Horn to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Rhino Mastery: The Kill	Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, George? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength. When you're ready to face him, head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake. It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill. 
Read the Vrykul Insult to Bjorn Halgurdsson in Baleheim, then lead him back to Lydell's Ambush and help slay him.	Adding Injury to Insult	The vrykul are being clever about this. Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve. This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead. We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult. Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure. Take this piece of paper and read it to him. Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here. We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive. 
Bring a pure sample of Oracle Blood to the Altar of Kartak to summon Kartak. With the aid of Kartak's shared powers, slaughter 50 of the nearby Sparktouched Gorlocs for Shaman Jakjek in Kartak's Hold.	Kartak's Rampage	You the great Lich Hunter, eh? Good to have such strong Frenzyheart ally for battle. Maybe you strong enough to call Kartak even. Big battle at Kartak's Hold to southwest. Go kill spark big-tongues until you get good bit of Oracle Blood. Bring blood to altar in Kartak's Hold to call Kartak for delicious feast of big-tongue. Kartak take your body if you worthy... with Kartak's powers, you slaughter more big-tongues than even best dreams. Go kill lots, hunter! 
Nishera the Garden Keeper at the Emerald Dragonshrine has asked you to acquire The Plume of Alystros.	The Plume of Alystros	I can feel that the shrine is not completely back in balance. The verdant keeper has been angered by our actions, and I sense that he will not listen to reason. Alystros is an immense skytalon who perches at the south end of the Emerald Dragonshrine. It is he who is in charge of the dragonshrine's aerial defenses. I fear that we will have to deal with him. Take these skytalon molts and place them on the ground where he can see them. He will come. Bring me his plume. 
Find Banthok Icemist at Icemist Village.	Strength of Icemist	<Greatmother Icemist bows.>It is an honor to meet you, hero. It is because of your actions that many of us are here now, alive and ready for battle against the Scourge. You have done so much for us that it shames me to ask you for your assistance once more. Despite my pleas, my only son, Banthok, left here to go in search of his father, High Chief Icemist. He was last seen heading west, towards Icemist Village. Please find Banthok. I do not know what I would do if I lost my son. 
Thyra Kvinnshal in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. Use the Vials of Frost Oil to destroy 30 Plagued Proto-Drake Eggs.	Aberrations	The Lich King sent emissaries to us on three different occasions. All three were promptly dismembered. Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances. Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in. Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find. Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept. 
Travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine and blow the Emblazoned Battle Horn. Defeat Grom'thar the Thunderbringer and bring his head back to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple.	Wanton Warlord	There's no reason to suspect Dregmar's words are anything but true. Whether Grom'thar defeats you or is defeated by you, he can wash his hands of this. Follow his instructions... take the horn that you brought me earlier, travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine, and blow it to announce your challenge. When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head. 
Overlord Razgor at Warsong Hold wants you to kill 15 Nerub'ar Nerubians.	Taking Back Mightstone Quarry	While Warsong is protected by 10 feet of steel and stone on all sides, this quarry is soft and primed for attacks by the Nerubians.<Razgor points west.>Beyond this quarry stand thousands of Scourge, awaiting orders to attack. Should the Nerubians take down our inner defenses, we will be overrun by the undead legions of Arthas. We can't let that happen - which is why you're going on the offensive and slaughtering the Nerubians in the quarry. Blood and thunder, soldier! Take 'em both with you. 
Find Sergeant Bonesnap northwest of Silverbrook and pass the Test of Mettle.	Test of Mettle	Alright, friend. You've done us a favor or two, but that's not the true test of a person's courage. Around these parts, you're not a real hunter unless you wear your prey's skin.<Sergei unsheathes his skinning knife and hands it to you.>The leader of those motherless orcs attacking our town is called Bonesnap; you'll find him at a camp further northwest. That's right. You're going to skin the monster. 
	The Amphitheater of Anguish: From Beyond!	I'm not gonna lie to you, pal. You might be overmatched here. This next one is a being from the elemental planes! I don't even know what's gonna show up in that arena! If you think you're up to it, get in there and give 'em hell! 
The Avatar of Freya wants you to defeat Thalgran Blightbringer by using Freya's Ward to reflect his Deathbolts back to him sevenfold.	Returned Sevenfold	The agents of the Lich King have foolishly trespassed upon these lands where the power of life rules supreme. All harm they inflict will be returned to them sevenfold. The monster directly responsible for corrupting the land is known as Thalgran Blightbringer; you will find him just to the north of here. Take this ward and use it to reflect the power of death upon him. Show the Scourge that the power of life prevails above all. 
Request the aid of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple.	The Touch of an Aspect	The dragon-queen, Alexstrasza, possesses magics over all life. In the past, she has used great fire to incinerate undead and rebirth fresh new life in their place. Perhaps her powers might be able to save our Bridenbrad as well. Alexstrasza makes her home at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight - please go to her and humbly request her aid on my behalf. 
Search Rageclaw Den for a clue about who or what initiated the attacks against the Rageclaw Wolvar.	In Search Of Answers	These poor creatures are the only survivors. According to their chief, the Drakkari trolls and Rageclaw wolvar have been allies for thousands of years. They've been living here, alongside the trolls, for generations, completely unaware of the ever changing world around them. To the Rageclaw, a troll is a troll, so the troll attack upon their den took them by surprise. We need some answers, George. Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks. 
Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to slay 5 Wyrm Reanimators, 8 Cultist Corrupters and 3 Vrykul Necrolords at Sindragosa's Fall.	Sindragosa's Fall	You're a real star, George. See, when I give one of these other soldiers an assignment, the odds of them getting it done are about fifty-fifty. The odds of them coming back... well, slightly worse. But with you, it's always a guaranteed thing. Like gnomish clockwork! Anyway, I have another one for you. Sindragosa's Fall, east of the valley. There is some serious cultist activity, including and not limited to, the raising of frost wyrms. I need you to go kick their teeth in. I hate cultists. 
Help Longrunner Proudhoof and his Warsong raiders to survive the assault upon Steeljaw's Caravan and finish off the spirit of Force-Commander Steeljaw. If successful, report to Overlord Bor'gorok at Bor'gorok Outpost.	We Strike!	One of your orcs named Steeljaw tried to save some time by taking a shortcut through our burial grounds. This had better not be how your Horde normally acts, Human, or you will find the taunka to be the end of you! But, you look as if you want to help fix this situation. Good! Steeljaw's cursed spirit now haunts this place and disturbs the remains of my ancestors. We must put an end to him! If we live through this, tell your Overlord Bor'gorok at the outpost to the north. Are you with me? 
Speak with Mobu at Garrosh's Landing.	Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself	We need to get these tanks back up and runnin'! They ain't gonna fix themselves. Mobu's gonna be the one to handle that stuff. Talk to him and see what he needs. Maybe you can shut him up before he finally drives me into a berserker frenzy and I cleave him in two! 
Crusader Valus at Light's Trust in Dragonblight has asked you to slay 15 Jintha'kalar Scourge.	The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar	We wrested this ancient Drakkari temple from a swarm of invading Scourge. Not more than one-hundred paces from where we stand is the ruined city of Jintha'kalar. Scourge necromancers run amok, turning the living Drakkari trolls that remain into servants of the Lich King. All are now lost to the Light. All must be purged.<Valus looks upon you sternly.>All. 
Normantis has asked you to report to Librarian Donathan on Amber Ledge.	Sharing Intelligence	Thank you, Mechanic! The information you've extracted is of vital importance to the Kirin Tor. Return at once to Donathan as we make plans for the rescue of Lady Evanor. 
Capture 12 Chicken Escapees for Elder Harkek at Frenzyheart Hill.	Chicken Party!	I bet you not guess what happen again. Nope, not Goregek or chickens. Okay, I lie. Goregek let chickens out again. Dumb Goregek and rumbly belly. Let me know if you need help from any of the hunters... they around here somewhere. 
Keristrasza has asked you to bring her to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield.	Mustering the Reds	Malygos is certainly aware that something is amiss. I know him. His focus is fragmented. I am confident that I can lure him from the safety of his realm when he learns what has become of his precious Saragosa. Take me to Raelorasz at once, George. He must rouse every dragon he commands to face Malygos. 
Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to freeze 8 Spores.	Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers	The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep. When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery. I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating. 
Kill High Cultist Zangus and return High Cultist Zangus's Head to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.	Marked for Death: High Cultist Zangus	I witnessed his treachery with my own eyes! The traitor led an Anub'ar assault on this stronghold, taking out some of my best soldiers.<Gort shakes his head.>He'd been working with the Scourge the whole time and we didn't have a clue! How many more like Zangus are there? We'll find 'em all and when we do...<Gort makes a cutting motion across his neck.>First on the list is Zangus. Our scouts report that he is hiding in The Pit of Narjun, west of here. Find him, kill him, bring me his head. 
Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to free 6 Captive Mechagnomes and kill 3 Stormforged Taskmasters.	Slaves of the Stormforged	To the southwest, on the western side of the Snowdrift Plains, the iron dwarves have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive mechagnomes, servants of Keeper Mimir, to mine ore. I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help. Go to the Frozen Mine, George, and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny. 
Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge wants you to take the Anderhol's Slider Cider and use the nearby outhouse to retrieve the Partially Processed Amberseeds.	Doing Your Duty	Alright, Human. Here's the juice. It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse. Now go get me those seeds! 
Equip your lance, then mount the Stabled Quel'dorei Steed outside the pavilion. Speak to Jeran Lockwood and use Thrust 5 times on a Melee Target, then return to Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	Mastery Of Melee	The heart of tournament competition is mounted melee combat. Take this lance and mount the stabled Quel'dorei steed just outside the pavilion. Once you're mounted, seek out Jeran Lockwood. He's on the northern edge of the tournament grounds at the training area east of the Aspirants' Ring. Jeran will instruct you on how to use your defenses to keep you safe while attacking a melee target at close range. 
Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering has requested that you use a Lithe Stalker to scout out Malykriss.	The Vile Hold	We need to know what we're up against. Use the eye of dominion to assume control of a lithe stalker and scout out the area. There are a few spots in particular I saw when flying in that I want you to get a closer look at: the overlook in the northeast, the work area in the southeast, the large forge near the center, and the ritual area in the southwest. The stalker can leap far and won't be hurt by large falls - use that to your advantage to get up and down from those ramparts. 
Report to Stefan Vadu at Ebon Watch in Zul'Drak.	Zul'Drak	Our death knight allies in Zul'Drak are in need of heroes to aid them in securing the troll lands from the Scourge. Those willing to aid should travel to the southwestern camp of Ebon Watch and speak with Stefan Vadu there. 
Speak to Kalecgos to agree to his proposition.	At One	I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake. I cannot bear to lose her, George. I must make a solemn request of you. Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception. Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you? 
Bring 5 Runed Saronite Plates to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch.	The Runesmiths of Malykriss	Those shards you recovered can only have come from one place, Malykriss. It's the seat of the Lich King's metalworking operations, to the east of Corp'rethar. What's puzzling is that metal isn't needed to stitch together abominations or flesh giants, or to summon skeletal servants. Find the skeletal runesmiths working on the bottom level of Malykriss and capture the plates they're working on. We need to find out why this metal is finding its way to the Fleshwerks. 
Jeer Sparksocket at K3 would like 10 pieces of Charred Wreckage.	Clean Up	To the point... Ricket's asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts. Just west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh? There should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage? 
Ulfang has asked you to kill the traitorous worgs, Bjomolf and Varg. Return to him in disguise in the Rivenwood after you have done so. If you somehow lose the Worg Disguise, return to Sage Mistwalker for a replacement.	Brother Betrayers	Mistwalker is from my dreams! If you are his friend, you are mine. I was alpha male until the last full moon. Then the strange white worg, Garwal, came from the north, and with the help of my once-brothers, he quickly became alpha. There is something unnatural about him. To help, you must first kill those who betrayed me. Bjomolf hunts to the northwest of a place the two-legs call Steel Gate. And look for Varg to the southeast, near the West Spear Tower. They will not be fooled by your form. 
Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Blood Gem on a Deranged Indu'le Villager and return to him with a Filled Blood Gem.	In Service of Blood	The blood of innocents was once used to sate the thirst of the blade. Alas, such options are no longer available to me.<Koltira pauses to think.>We must improvise. South of here, upon the high bluffs, is the tuskarr village of Indu'le. Having been recently overrun by the Blue Dragonflight's chaotic magic, the resident tuskarr of Indu'le have gone mad. Take this blood gem and use it on a deranged villager. If I cannot take the blood of innocents, I shall have the blood of the meek! 
Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village wants you to wear the Imbued Scourge Shroud in the Temple City of En'kilah and scout the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain, and the Spire of Decay.	Blending In	Sage Aeire has finished the shroud. Take it with you and travel to the Temple City of En'kilah. Don the cloak within the city's bounds to hide yourself from most of the Scourge there. This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders. While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city. While the shroud will shield you from most of the Scourge, the En'kilah abominations will be able to find you if you get too close. 
Commander Kunz at the Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him. Captain Brandon and Captain Rupert are posted at Drak'Sotra, Captain Grondel is posted in Drak'Agal, and Alchemist Finklestein is posted in Heb'valok.	Troll Patrol	Unsheathe that weapon, Human. It's time to go on patrol! I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance. You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you. Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it! Dismissed! 
Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker's heave ability to destroy 12 sleeping Iceskin Sentries.	Stunning View	Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air. As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep. 
Speak with Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port.	Hell Has Frozen Over...	Fordragon's got another thing coming if he thinks the group of green-gilled scrubs he sent to defend this port can hold out much longer.<Macalroy raises an eyebrow as he examines your equipment.>You, however, might fare a bit better. The importance of holding this port cannot be stated enough; and with those monsters flying overhead, the situation around here has gone from bad to worse. Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum. 
Return the Flesh-bound Tome to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.	The Flesh-Bound Tome	The tome is bound in flesh and appears to be bleeding. Upon examination you discover page after page filled with strange symbols that appear to be written in blood. Whatever knowledge is held within the pages of this tome could be important. Return it to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer, east of Icemist Village. 
Kill Warlord Tartek and retrieve the Mistwhisper Treasure for Mistcaller Soo-gan at Mistwhisper Refuge. If you lose Jaloot's Favorite Crystal, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	The Lost Mistwhisper Treasure	So some puppy-men come and smash blue crystals at Great Mist Stone! Lots of rain and lightning and badness... blue is wrong crystal for Great Mist Stone! Dumb puppy-men. After lightning, puppy-men stole big treasure we found in the sea-lake. We need treasure back to give to Great Mist Stone! Mist Stone is angry after what the puppy-men did! One who took it named Tarter... no, Tiktak... no, no... Tartek. That it, Tartek! He went to the camp thing to north. Go get treasure back! 
Garren at Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Sundered Chasm anomaly and return to him with the readings.	Monitoring the Rift: Sundered Chasm	Did you feel that?! That was just an aftershock... you should've been here a few minutes ago! I'm afraid I must call upon your services again. My instruments indicate that there is an immense disruption just west of here, far beneath the water's surface. Just as before, I need you to take the arcanometer and capture the anomaly's data. I'll cast a spell that will enable you to breathe underwater. If it wears off before you find it, come let me know and I'll renew its effects. 
The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to kill 3 Forgotten Depths High Priests, 3 Forgotten Depths Underkings, and 8 Reanimated Crusaders.	The Purging Of Scourgeholme	The Scourge have sent their armies at the Argent Crusade and have been repelled. What they do now is called a 'slash and burn.' All prisoners that they hold at Scourgeholme will be executed and raised as servants of the Lich King. Undoubtedly the Argent Crusade will request that you give their soldiers a proper farewell. I'll ask no such thing of you. To succeed we must kill Scourge indiscriminately. Venture to Scourgeholme, northwest through the Breach, and lay waste to all that stand in your way. 
Report to Sergeant Hammerhill at Valiance Keep.	A Time for Heroes	It's good to have you among us, George. We've all heard of your past deeds. As you know, King Wrynn is moving great armies into Northrend to meet those of Arthas. But armies are nothing without true heroes to inspire and lead them. I want you to be that hero for my men. Fight alongside them against the Scourge that lays siege to our stronghold. Report to Sergeant Hammerhill outside the inner hold. Valiance Keep cannot fall. The future of our campaign depends on it. 
Crusader MacKellar at Crusader Forward Camp has asked that you find Crusader Dargath, Gerk and Burr.	That's What Friends Are For...	We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, ""If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all."" He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen. I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them? 
Use Valnok's Flare Gun to call down a Kor'kron War Rider at Icemist Village. Mount the Kor'kron War Rider and then use it to kill 25 Anub'ar Blightbeasts! Return to Valnok Windrager at Agmar's Hammer should you complete this mission.	Blightbeasts be Damned!	You've no doubt seen the army of Anub'ar blightbeasts that are being constructed at Icemist Village. The Anub'ar have plans to send those monsters against our soldiers at the Wrathgate. This cannot happen! Venture west to Icemist Village with this flare gun and use it to call down one of my war riders. Climb on its back and command it to destroy the blightbeasts that are out of reach from the ground! Once you have decimated their aerial forces, return to me for your reward! 
Take the Orphaned Mammoth Calf to Khu'nok the Behemoth in the Borean Tundra.	Khu'nok Will Know	Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild. But there is a way! Hope yet remains! North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the Scalding Pools, you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a mammoth as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do. 
Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Wipe That Grin Off His Face	We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight. The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig. Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, George. 
Speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost in Sholazar Basin.	In Search of Bigger Game	Well, George, you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals -- rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges. Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there. He's heard rumors of gigantic primordial drakes. Just imagine what a quarry they would be! Go check up on Dorian and see if he's had any luck. 
	Hand of the Oracles	 
Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post wants you to take the Tranquilizer Dart and use it on Tatjana in Solstice Village. Bring Tatjana back to the White Pine Trading Post.	Anatoly Will Talk	My sister is here somewhere, and I can't seem to get this monster to talk. He doesn't seem to care about his own well-being, but I've an idea. I knew Anatoly's wife, Tatjana, from before the wolfcult arrived -- she was a horse-handler. Take this tranquillizer dart. Bring her back alive, we're going to need her if we're to have any leverage with Anatoly. I will help you find the person behind all this once we save my sister. 
Deliver the Strange Mojo to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand.	Strange Mojo	This bottle of strange mojo may be the key to what is truly going on here. The Zandalari troll Hexxer Ubungo, back at The Argent Stand, may want to take a look at it. 
Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to take the Unliving Choker to Bloodrose Datura.	Near Miss	It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, Human. Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurance. You've been targeted by someone, or something....Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you. 
Har'koa has asked you to determine what has happened to Quetz'lun. Speak to her to be able to ride one of her children stealthily into the Altar of Quetz'lun. Return to her at the Altar of Har'koa once you have done so.	I Sense a Disturbance	There's something wrong with Quetz'lun, the wind serpent goddess. What it is exactly I cannot sense, but I do know that her altar has been overrun with powerful creatures. I'm going to send you there on the back of one of my children, which you saved. The two of you will move swiftly and with great stealth to uncover what has become of Quetz'lun. My child will see you safely back to me. Just keep your eyes open. When you are ready, ask and I will call one of my kittens for you. 
Mack at Granite Springs wants you to use his grog to burn 20 Famished Scourge Trolls at Drak'Tharon.	Seared Scourge	<Hic>... gotta burn these corpshes 'fore they shtart walkin' around again. Poppa always said, only thing worshe than havin' to kill a troll is havin' ta kill a troll twice. Say,<hic>... shpeakin' of Scourge, we can't get into tha' troll keep up north 'til we get them trolls thinned out a bit. How 'bout ya take shome o my grog here and put them bashtards outta their misery? 
Speak with Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.	News From the East	Westguard needs to know what's going on here, George. I want you to personally deliver the news to Captain Adams. Whenever you're ready, let me know and I'll put you back in the construct for one final flight. It'll take you to Westguard Keep, but more than likely blow up in the process. It's been a pleasure... 
Vaelen the Flayed at The Shadow Vault wants you to free 8 Ebon Blade Prisoners. They can be found in the cages throughout the greater Jotunheim region.	Ebon Blade Prisoners	Now that I'm back, I'm certain that the baron will want me to recover my men. I can see that we're barely hanging on here. The Lich King's forces are about to break through and we won't be able to hold without my captured death knights. Can you assist me once more, George? Go back to Jotunheim and let them out of those cages. Break the damn locks, I don't care what you have to do. The vrykul likely have the keys. Just get my men free! 
Speak to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch in Icecrown.	Blackwatch	The Scourge has a large facility called the Fleshwerks, dedicated to producing abominations and flesh giants. If we can shut it down, we can deprive the Lich King of a large component of his armies. I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of Corp'rethar. I'm told the Argent Crusade is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the darkrider will know what to do. Find and assist her. 
Bring 5 Runic Keystone Fragments to Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.	The Runic Keystone	Brann's journal mentions that he used a runic keystone to illuminate the important runes on the plate he discovered. Without the keystone, the plate's contents would be little better than gibberish. At the end of Brann's last entry, he describes the iron dwarf defenders seizing the keystone from him, shattering it, and dividing it among themselves. Before we can decipher the runed plate, we must hunt down the fragments. Any of the dwarves within Thor Modan or the buildings around it may carry fragments. 
Overlord Razgor at Warsong Hold wants you to destroy 10 Nerub'ar Egg Sacs.	Cutting Off the Source	Aerial reconnaissance of the quarry reports that the Nerubians are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are... They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict. You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em. Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses. 
Reclaim the Lower Horn Half and Upper Horn Half from Chieftain Burblegoggle and Chieftain Gurgleboggle and bring them to Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village.	The Horn of Elemental Fury	I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that, we'll need help and a bit of luck. Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a scroll with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the Flood Plains surrounding the village to the north and southwest. 
Deliver the Alliance Missive to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in eastern Dragonblight.	High Commander Halford Wyrmbane	<Palena hands the missive back to you.>Snowstorm will take you to Wintergarde, George. I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now! 
Escort Harrison from Drakil'jin Ruins, then speak with Harkor at Harkor's Camp.	Dun-da-Dun-tah!	Listen, kid. This is no place for you to be playin' around. I'm about to make a break for it. Stick with me and I'll get you outta here. 
Go to the mine in Farshire, obtain the Cart Release Key from Captain Jacobs and use it to release the ore cart. Return to Gerald Green in Farshire when you've completed this task.	Fruits of Our Labor	The Scourge just keeps coming... but we can't give up! Listen, George. Inside that mine there's a cart with the last of the ore the Alliance is going to see on this side of the continent for a long time. The problem is the cart release is locked. When the military went in there, Captain Jacobs commandeered all the important equipment, including the cart release key. The plague that affected the soldiers in the mine must also have affected Jacobs. Get the key from him and salvage the ore. 
Defeat Megalith and return to Sage Edan at Camp Winterhoof.	Demolishing Megalith	Binder Murdis created Megalith to be a kind of keystone for the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. I will ask Chieftain Ashtotem to divert some of our men as we move north and dedicate them to eliminating the last of the runed giants. Without their giants, the Iron Dwarves cannot stand against us. Search the foothills of Frostblade Peak, north of Giants' Run for Megalith and defeat him! 
Bring Shango's Pelt to Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Dreadsaber Mastery: Ready to Pounce	Shango awaits, George. If you have succeeded in your tracking, he will not know that you stalk him, and you will need the advantage. He is supposed to be bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than the other dreadsabers of the basin. Travel north, to the western shore of Bittertide Lake and near the falls that feed it, do battle with Shango. If you succeed, return with his pelt. 
Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.	Gaining an Audience	George, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz. The temple sits in the center of the Dragonblight. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross The Dragon Wastes to get to it. I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction, he'll see to it that you gain an audience with Queen Alexstrasza. We can only hope that we're not too late. Thank you for all that you have done on our behalf. Safe journeys! 
Moodle wants you to rescue 6 of the Mosswalker Victims in Mosswalker Village, though some of them may no longer be alive to save. If you lose Moodle's Stress Ball, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	The Mosswalker Savior	There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this. Let's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process. 
Speak with Lord Devrestrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.	Report to Lord Devrestrasz	I abhor the loss of life... any life. But I will not stand idly by and allow Malygos to kill us and defile the temple! I have appointed Lord Devrestrasz as the commander of Wyrmrest's defenses. Speak with Torastrasza to ride a drake down to him. Please lend him your aid, George. Your involvement with the defense of Wyrmrest will be critical to us prevailing against the blue dragonflight. 
Return to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle with news of the effects of the Breath of Alexstrasza.	Hope Yet Remains	<Bridenbrad raises a hand to you as he catches his breath.>It was nearly as painful as it looked, but it was as if I could feel some of the corruption being burnt away from within my body. It seems the plague is not so readily bested though. Mechanic, thank you for everything that you have done. Your selfless actions have renewed my hope that there is yet great good left within this world - I can depart without fear that darkness will prevail in my absence. Go now, go with no regrets. 
Capture Doctor Kolher's Orders at Deathspeaker's Watch, then return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Black Knight's Fate	You said the body was taken by cultists? I can only think of one place they would have gone, Deathspeaker's Watch, the encampment on the rise west of the tournament grounds. Whatever the cultists are doing must be stopped. The rumors I've heard can only be true, then. The infamous Doctor Kohler must be among the cultists, practicing his arts. Look for a rise or an altar overlooking the cultist camp, slay the doctor, and look for proof of his plans. Slow down his work in any other way you can. 
A Dying Berserker has asked that you slay 5 Dying Soldiers at the Broken Front. Report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar on Orgrim's Hammer when it is done.	Avenge Me!	I hear them, <brother/sister>....The moans of the wounded Alliance... they taunt me...Finish what we have begun here, Mechanic. Show no mercy... let none of them survive. For... the Horde... 
Quetz'lun's Spirit at the Altar of Quetz'lun wants you to use Quetz'lun's Hexxing Stick upon High Priest Mu'funu, High Priestess Tua-Tua, and High Priest Hawinni. Once you have done this, slay them.	Hell Hath a Fury	It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds. Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent. Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest.<Quetz'lun displays a toothy grin.>Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die. 
Search for the commander of the mage hunter forces at Indu'le Village and Lake Indu'le.	Search Indu'le Village	I'm certain that you'll find the next ley line focus somewhere in the remains of Indu'le Village to the southeast. The problem is, I've had absolutely no reports of there being one there. I need you to go investigate the village for any signs of the focus or the mage hunters and their commander in the area. Search in the lake if you have to! 
Ulfang has asked you to collect the Eyes of the Eagle. Return to him in disguise in the Rivenwood after you have done so. If you somehow lose the Worg Disguise, return to Watcher Moonleaf for a replacement.	Eyes of the Eagle	Garwal hides himself behind an unnatural magic. None can see him unless he wants you to. There may be one chance we can take, though. My enemy, the great eagle, Talonshrike, is said to have eyes that can see anything. If you were to take her eyes, then you would surely be able to see Garwal. Talonshrike keeps her nest at the base of a waterfall just to the southwest of the vrykul place called Skorn. If you touch the eggs in her nest, she will come down from the sky to kill you. Get her eyes. 
Lady Evanor has sent you to speak with Surristrasz on Amber Ledge.	Dragonspeak	I am aware of your recent deeds here, George, and again I thank you. As for this local menace, we've learned all we need to know from them. They'll be dealt with in short order. On now to more important issues....Azeroth needs you. The region just west of here is the center of an urgent crisis. I'll leave the details to Lord Surristrasz. You must speak with him at once. Good luck, friend of Dalaran. 
Deliver the Unblemished Heart of the Guardian and the Gusty Essence of the Warden to Har'koa at Zim'Torga.	The Gods Have Spoken	The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom. Travel north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart. Travel east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence. Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear. 
Use the Refurbished Demolisher to destroy 150 Decomposed Ghouls, 20 Frostskull Mages and 2 Bone Giants in the Valley of Lost Hope. Speak to Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp when you've completed this task.	Do Your Worst	You're going to use this machine against the Scourge? You're not going to win against them like that. You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them. But you won't win. Not out here. When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north. There is an old army encampment. What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against. 
Bring 25 Valiant's Seals to Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	The Valiant's Charge	In your training as a valiant, you'll have the chance to test your skills against valiants representing other cities. Although a valiant's battles are not a formal part of the competition, you will learn valuable lessons about the fighting styles and weaknesses of your opponents. The valiants are a spirited lot, competing amongst themselves for honor and notoriety. Train as a valiant until you are confident of your ability to best all who face you, then bring me the seals you have earned. 
Take the Head of Gammothra to Garrosh Hellscream in Warsong Hold.	Trophies of Gammoth	We cannot take all of the credit for this Horde victory, George. It was you who risked your life to test the bloodspore and it was you who ultimately put an end to Gammothra. Honor us by returning to Warsong Hold and presenting the head of Gammothra to Lord Hellscream. 
Sergeant Gorth wants you to kill 16 Winterskorn Vrykul inside Baleheim.	Baleheim Bodycount	Them vrykuls just keeps coming and coming out from town west of here. No end in sight! Gorth has an idea. You go INSIDE town and kill them Winterskorn there. THEN they stop coming here! 
Retrieve the Portable Seismograph and use it to take stability readings in Thor Modan, then return to Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.	Steady as a Rock?	Orlond's notes indicate that he brought a piece of equipment called a portable seismograph with him, but the device is nowhere to be seen. The survey log shows that Orlond completed all his readings in the Thor Modan tunnel, save one labeled the 'east end of the exposed tunnel.'The last entry in the log indicates Orlond tried to take refuge in the water and was attacked by subterranean threshers. They might've taken his equipment. You'll need to recover it before you can take the last reading. 
Wait for Serinar to administer the disguise of a Burning Depths Necrolyte, then proceed to the back of the Maw of Neltharion to uncover what the Cult of the Damned is doing there. Return to Serinar with details regarding their purpose.	The Best of Intentions	The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct. I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes. Be cautious George, any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion. 
Bring news of Crusader Bridenbrad's fate to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle.	A Hero Remains	I know why you've come... they've sent you to bring me back, but that cannot happen. I carry the plague of undeath, Mechanic, and I'll not share my fate with those near me. No, I shall stay here. My only regret lies in what I may become when death grips me. I do not fear death itself, but I loathe to consider serving the traitor, Arthas. Leave me... and see to it that no one else comes looking. You would do me a great disservice if you were to expose anyone to the plague that I carry. 
Escort Apothecary Hanes out of the Derelict Strand. Report to Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord when you've completed this task.	Trail of Fire	Thanks for bailing me out of this mess, George. I was not looking forward to what these Alliance scumbags had in store for me. Let's get out of here and see if we can get back at them somehow. Is that a campfire over there? 
Engineer Reed at Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak has asked that you recover 10 pieces of Scourge Scrap Metal.	Making Something Out Of Nothing	Prince Navarius must be stopped. We can't let the Scourge continue to use this area as a zombie factory. If we can get the tank operational we might stand a chance. What I need right now are spare parts. Northwest of here is an area called Thrym's End. The Scourge armies are using the area as a base of sorts. Spread out across the base is the wreckage from their arrival. Bits and pieces of Scourge scrap metal litter the landscape. Get that stuff to me and I'll try and put it to good use. 
	The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the Bloodrager!	You're not gonna believe this, pal. Your next fight is against Korrak the Bloodrager! Looks like the Drakkari trolls are pulling a power play! And let me tell you, buddy, he's been sippin' the animal god juice. He's good and ready to pound you into the ground. Are you ready? 
Thorim, at the Terrace of the Makers, wants you to use the Horn of the Peaks and call on the Earthen to defeat 20 Iron Dwarves and 7 Iron Sentinels.	The Earthen Oath	For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity. Not the brave earthen, however. Their oath to protect these grounds with their lives has gone unbroken. Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn. That moment has arrived. We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory. Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers. 
Travel back to Wyrmrest and let Nalice know that Serinar's task is complete.	Tales of Destruction	You can leave now, Human. Go tell Nalice she missed out on a good slaughter. 
Deliver The High General's Head to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Wintergarde Keep.	My Old Enemy	My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend. Somehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south. While they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles. So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof. 
Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold.	A Show of Strength	Preparations for war are underway in the vrykul village of Voldrune to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk. We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a Mechanic of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength. Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with! 
Speak with Squire Artie to contribute 10 gold to the Argent Crusade's cause.	Contributin' To The Cause	The bestest of the champions come to the chapel to hear the argent confessor speak every day. You should see how much she inspires them, George. Not only do they fight for the Argent Crusade, but they put a lot of money into the collection basket when I take it around. Maybe you'd like to contribute too? 
Obtain The Flesh of ""Two Huge Pincers"" and deliver it to Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor.	The Bait	I'm sure of it... our ancient aquatic nemesis, Tu'u'gwar, ""He Who Plays With Food"", has returned. We must lay a trap for him, you and I. If Tu'u'gwar has one weakness it's his stomach. There's one meat for certain that he'd never be able to pass up.""Two Huge Pincers"", the mother of all crabs, Kili'ua, paces upon her island out in the waters to the southwest. You must pay her a visit and return with her meat. 
Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to kill 5 Scourge Banner-Bearers, 5 Scourge Converters, and 20 Converted Heroes.	Bloodspattered Banners	In the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar, the Scourge seeks to use the fallen against us. Scourge lieutenants have woken the valley's dead and imbued them with fearsome strength and fervor. The banners carried by the Scourge leaders in the glacier area are the source of these powers. Kill the banner-bearers, and you will weaken the converted heroes they lead. It falls to you to rid us of this obstacle, and test the resistance before the main body can advance. 
Yorg Stormheart at Frosthold has requested that you speak to Fjorlin Frostbrow to secure a ride and face your challenge.	Fervor of the Frostborn	I be more than willing ta lend my shelter and home ta travelers in need, but I'm nae too keen ta force my people inte yer affairs. I'll tell ye what... my people are warriors, straight and true. On the day a frostborn becomes a man, he has ta prove himself in battle. He has ta show us that he'll not let size hold'm back. Show me yer as strong and fierce as one of my men, and I'll have them lend ye an ear or a blade. Speak ta Fjorlin over by the cliff to the south there and he'll put ye ta the test. 
Christopher Sloan at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Frostfin.	The One That Got Away	The barbfish you brought should work well as bait for most fish, but I fear it'll attract a monster! When I first arrived, I put some of Nat Pagle's favorite bait on my hook and cast it into the water. A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins! Would've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist! 
High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to kill Venomtip and 10 Emperor Cobras. If you lose Lafoo's Bug Bag, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	Make the Bad Snake Go Away	We were here long before the puppy-men came. This is very sacred place - we will not leave. You seem like maybe you good, but we have Lafoo stay with you just in case. You understand we think. There snakes thing that keeps trying to eat our hatchlings. Go with Lafoo and make them stop, okay? Especially big one near waterfall to northeast. 
Show the Blight Specimen to Tobias Sarkhoff at New Agamand.	Give it a Name	My, my, how long has it been? How long have we been working on this damned plague? Finally, after an eternity of failure, we are blessed with perfection. This... It doesn't even have a proper name yet! This blight... That's it, BLIGHT! This blight will tear down the very fabric of life!<Harris hands you a vial.>Now, find the bat handler, Tobias, and show him the specimen. He'll get you on your way to Venomspite. 
Place the Stolen Proto-Dragon Eggs on top of the Broodmother's Nest and return to Thorim at the Temple of Storms.	Territorial Trespass	Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known. She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over. Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest. You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here. I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage. Hopefully. 
Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to kill 5 Harbingers of Horror and 5 Corp'rethar Guardians.	The Guardians of Corp'rethar	Corp'rethar, called the Horror Gate. It is the last barrier between us and the Icecrown Citadel. It waits to the south of the Ironwall Rampart, beyond the glacier and the Conflagration. By the time our troops reach it, they will be exhausted and worse. We must weaken its defenses, or our army's strength will break upon its walls. Its battlements are manned by some of the Lich King's fiercest and most zealous servants. Do all you can to destroy these guardians and hope it is enough. 
Speak to Yorg Stormheart in Frosthold.	The Frostborn King	Definitely... I can see exactly what the core must look like. If any of the frostborn have seen it, they'll be sure to recognize the description. There's no time to waste, let's get straight to business. Go talk to King Stormheart and request his aid... he's sure to know someone who can help us find the core. And be nice about it will you - he's very respected around here. 
Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to steal the image of an Onslaught Raven Priest. Return the Banshee's Magic Mirror to her when you have done so.	The Perfect Dissemblance	You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the spy mistress. It only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests. Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror. Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you. 
Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to free Akali and then to inform Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga.	Rampage	George, there is no time left. You must take the key and use it to unlock Akali. He is being held in the courtyard in front of Gundrak, the capital of Zul'Drak. Akali's chains are secured by four anchor points. You must unlock each of them to set the rhino god free. Gundrak is teeming with ice trolls. However, I believe that if you're careful, you should be able to slip in without too much danger. Once you're done, please inform the witch doctor. 
Jeer Sparksocket at K3 would like Sparksocket's Tools retrieved from his minefield.	Just Around the Corner	Blast it! Where are my tools? I had them here just a moment ago. Oh! I probably forgot them when I was setting up that minefield in the west. That's mildly inconvenient. I'd be quite appreciative if you could go get them for me. You'll need to watch your step though... you should be able to use the same path that I did to get out. Oh, and don't try to fly in... I had the presence of mind to set up turrets to shoot down anything that might fly, and they aren't very discerning in who they target. 
Elder Atuik wants you to go to Iskaal and slay 8 Northsea Slavers. Use the Horn of Kamagua should you need assistance.	Avenge Iskaal	The totem of Issliruk is ready, George, and for that I thank you. We must cast our peaceful ways for the time being and strike at those who've attacked our land and our kin. The pirate slavers that raided Iskaal have lost their minds and slaughtered all their captives. Go to Iskaal, to the east of here and do what must must be done. Take this horn and call on my brethren should you need assistance. 
Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Evergreen Trading Post and obtain the Cedar Chest.	Local Support	We've reached a deadlock with the Horde in Grizzly Hills. Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate. Until this morning, that is. The local trappers have requested our help. Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort. We get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need. Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest. 
Commander Falstaav has tasked you with the destruction of any 10 Scourge in the courtyard at The Argent Stand.	Defend the Stand	Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of Zul'Drak, we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell. The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them. Below in the courtyard you'll find no end to the fighting. Dispatch the Scourge there with all the zeal you can muster, Mechanic. 
Collect 10 Meaty Crab Chunks and deliver them to Glimmergut in Venture Bay.	Glimmerfin Welcome	First thing's first, they're probably hungry. Life up here in the cold isn't quite as easy as it is elsewhere, and even the most acclimated murlocs sometimes have trouble finding food. We're going to need to feed them, but also help them find food for themselves. They're already watching you, so search the area around where you found the murlocs for food sources and show them what to hunt. Then bring the meat to their leader--just look for the biggest one. 
Chief Rageclaw at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Drakuru ""Lock Openers"" found on various Drakuru trolls to free 8 Captured Rageclaw.	Trolls Is Gone Crazy!	Drakuru... You know who this troll is? I think bad troll are controlled by the Drakuru troll. They call themself Drakuru trolls - that how I know. Now you see why I am chief of Rageclaw. Smartest of all wolvar! But that not why I talk to you now. Bad troll come and kick Rageclaw out of den. Rageclaw that no run away held as prisoner in village. You go to Rageclaw Den, southeast, and free captured Rageclaw. Kill troll for lock opener. You maybe kill many troll for many lock opener. 
Locate Drom Frostgrip.	An Experienced Guide	I don't know where this core is hiding, but ye knew that. I said I'd help though, and that I shall. There's a hermit by the name of Drom Frostgrip who lives in a cave north of here... down in tha valley. We've strayed away from the titans a bit ourselves being that there are so few about, but Drom's loyal to the old ways... he keeps an eye on their most precious places and speaks te the keeper Creteus often. Yer sure to find him in the back of his cave... tell'm I sent ye and he'll help ye. 
Seek out Crusader MacKellar at the Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak.	Crusader Forward Camp	Crusader Dargath, Crusader MacKellar, Engineer Reed and the twins, Gerk and Burr, were sent to the Dead Fields to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here. In light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste. Pack up your belongings, George. You must leave at once! 
Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield wants you to gather 10 Frostberries from the Frostberry Bushes in Coldarra.	Nuts for Berries	Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken. Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me. Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in Dalaran studying ancient texts. To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me. 
Moodle wants you to collect 10 Lifeblood Shards, but stay away from the cave inside of the pillar itself. If you lose Moodle's Stress Ball, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	Lifeblood of the Mosswalker Shrine	I've always suspected that the pillars have been the main reason for our weather and seclusion from the undead... this confirms it a bit. Not terribly long ago, there was a sound of a great explosion when the Lifeblood Pillar fell. The weather changed for the mosswalkers almost immediately... it began to snow, something we never see. They were able to stop the snow by bringing more lifeblood crystals to the Great Moss Stone. Perhaps if we can do the same, it will help ward off the undead as well. 
Avareth Swiftstrike at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill 8 Icecrown Scourge. You may kill Scourge in any part of Icecrown except the Bombardment.	Training In The Field	The tournament is a time for testing your skills against your peers, but we must not forget that the real enemy, the Scourge, will not wait. As you learn to master mounted combat, do not forget to practice the skills that have served you well all these years. Show us that you can face the Scourge with honor and bravery, and you will earn your right to compete in this tournament. Travel to Icecrown and slay any Scourge you see there, but stay clear of the Bombardment, where you would be overwhelmed. 
Listen to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle's tale and then find Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip.	The Mechagnomes	Now that you're here, it's time for me to tell you the full story of what's going on. After you've heard my tale, go outside and find my second-in-command, Jinky Wingnut. She'll handle everything from here on out. 
Destroy 15 Proto-Drake Eggs and 15 Proto-Whelps, and then return to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.	The Clutches of Evil	George, I don't trust anyone but you to take care of this. I need the proto-drake eggs and proto-whelps in the burning forest to the southeast destroyed! Since we arrived here, the Ember Clutch has been ablaze; there must be some sort of perverse magic at work. And lately it seems to be growing. My men tell me that if we don't do something quickly, we'll be surrounded on all sides by the fire within a few weeks' time! Get down there and eliminate the threat by destroying those eggs and the proto-whelps. 
Pontius, the kennel keeper at Vengeance Landing, wants you to use the Plaguehound Cage to summon a Hungry Plaguehound and feed it Crow Meat from Fjord Crows west of Vengeance Landing.	Let Them Eat Crow	The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed. If our military doesn't understand that these beasts are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field. You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west? Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it! 
Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker wants you to rescue 10 Saronite Mine Slaves.	Slaves to Saronite	Our people are being captured and put to work as slaves in the saronite mines of Ymirheim, the vrykul stronghold in the middle of Icecrown. The Lich King has them mining that unholy ore day and night. I made a promise to Highlord Fordring that we would get those wretches out of there alive, and that's exactly what we will do. Unfortunately, I've been ordered to stay on this gunship and serve as an ambassador to the Valiance Expedition. Will you please rescue them in my stead, George? 
Use the Inventor's Disk to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the Databanks.	Data Mining	That disk you assembled... it's blank! Keeper Mimir, the tinker who built this library, must've hidden the information elsewhere. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there? That might be the disk's purpose. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key. 
Slay Dreadtalon and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.	WANTED: Dreadtalon	By decree of Overlord Agmar:Target: DreadtalonCrime: Attacks upon the HordeStatus: AliveDreadtalon is wanted for numerous attacks upon Horde caravans traveling to and from Venomspite. Dreadtalon makes his home on a bluff overlooking the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of Agmar's Hammer. He should be approached with extreme caution. All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Pristine Shoveltusk Hide and Steel Ribbing.	We Have the Technology	While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the iron dwarves the clone must be exact! I can make this happen. Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the shoveltusk of this region and steel ribbing from vrykul in Nifflevar or Baleheim to the northwest. 
The Leaper at The Shadow Vault wants you to use a Jotunheim Rapid-Fire Harpoon to shoot down 15 Jotunheim Proto-Drakes and their riders.	Shoot 'Em Up	Jotunheim has aerial defenses, both in terms of proto-drake riders and harpoon guns. They've concentrated these on their northern and western facings where they are most vulnerable. Let's use their defenses against them!<The Leaper pierces you with his single eye and cackles maniacally.>Take control of a harpoon gun on the platforms that overhang the cliffs on either side of Valhalas to the southwest. Take out the proto-drakes and their riders. Shoot 'em up! 
Report back to Koltira aboard Orgrim's Hammer.	Knowledge is a Terrible Burden	Now you know what you're up against, George. An opponent who no longer knows pain... remorse... or humanity. An opponent who will do anything to get what he wants. The heart was his weakness and now he knows you've found it. If you're going to go back for it, you'd best bring help. He will not leave it unguarded again. 
Hunt down and kill Bloodfeast, Iceshatter, and Drakegore east of Wyrmrest Temple. Bloodfeast resides in the southeastern corner of the Dragon Wastes, just north of the Emerald Dragonshrine. Iceshatter patrols the northern edge of the Mirror of Dawn. Drakegore wanders at the bottom of the cliffs west of the Bronze Dragonshrine. Return to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple once the magnataur have been slain.	Mighty Magnataur	Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime. East of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader. 
Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through one of the northern or southern passes, then kill 6 Frigid Necromancers and eliminate the source of the corruption under the shrine. Return to Ceristrasz once the task is complete.	Through Fields of Flame	I have one final task for you, Human... one that should turn the tide of this fight. Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine. I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it. I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle. 
High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants to you kill Deathspeaker Kharos.	Deathspeaker Kharos	The Cult of the Damned has redoubled its efforts to see us destroyed. They have grown bold and are massing their strength at Deathspeaker's Watch on the ridge west of the tournament grounds. The ruthless Deathspeaker Kharos has his men fortifying their positions, preparing to unleash all of the cult's weapons. My men are preparing themselves and the valiants to defend the grounds, but I want champions like you, George, to lead our efforts to blunt the attack. Find Deathspeaker Kharos and slay him. 
Defeat the gladiators at the Ring of Judgment and face Oluf the Violent. Defeat Oluf and recover the Ancient Cipher. Return the Ancient Cipher to Glorenfeld at the entrance to the Utgarde Catacombs.	Stunning Defeat at the Ring	Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgment. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs. Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the brink of discovering the missing link to human-kind! 
Present Magister Edien Sunhollow at the Argent Tournament with 15 Aspirant's Seals to signify you're ready to undergo the aspirant's challenge.	Up To The Challenge	When you have mastered the skills of the aspirant, you may choose to take the aspirant's challenge. The challenge will test your mounted combat skills and assess whether or not you're prepared to become a valiant. Should you pass, you will be able to join your capital city's delegation as a valiant. When you are ready to begin the challenge, return to me. 
Report to Ceristrasz on the ridge east of the Ruby Dragonshrine, west of Wyrmrest.	Report to the Ruby Dragonshrine	We need you at the Ruby Dragonshrine. The dragons are beset on all sides by the blue flight and the scourge... they're in no better a state than we are. The situation seems dire, but this affords us a rare opportunity to establish a valuable alliance. I secured a regiment to aid the red dragonflight against the Scourge at the Ruby Dragonshrine. If you have a fight in you, please go find Ceristrasz on the ridge east of the shrine and help him in any way that you can. 
Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to speak to Gorebag and take the tour of Zul'Drak.	Dark Horizon	Ahh, another supplicant answerin' da Lich King's call.<Drakuru sniffs you.>Freshly scourged, eh? Ya still be reekin' of da living! Long be da line of dem who seek da Lich King's blessings. Ya must rise above da masses and prove yerself worthy of wieldin' true power. Lookin' down over Zul'Drak, I sensed potential in ya. I ordered your - invitation. Da rest be up ta you....Go an' speak ta Gorebag for a tour of Zul'Drak. Dere be much ta do if you're to be of any worth to me. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to recover his Building Tools.	Tools to Get the Job Done	I've been studying this deactivated construct for days, George. I think I can create a reasonable facsimile of the golem that would have room inside to fit one passenger. The idea being that it would fool those iron dwarves and allow us to get inside Baelgun's. Now I'm not gonna be able to make anything with a hammer and poker. I need my tools! Unfortunately I left those behind at Ivald's Ruin when the iron dwarves first attacked. Get me my tools! Ivald's Ruin is located far to the northeast. 
Elder Atkanok wants you to guide the spirits of Elder Kesuk, Elder Sagani, and Elder Takret to their stone monuments.	Leading the Ancestors Home	With your help, the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful homes, the statues lovingly prepared by Kaskala's craftsmen and shaman. The ceremonies for these ancestors were interrupted during the attack on the quarry, and you will need to complete them. Take with you the objects that you recovered from the quarry, stand in front of the statues with the name markers, and recite this chant.<Words in a strange language flood your head, but you have no difficulty recalling them.> 
Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 10 Bloodspore Carpels.	The Wondrous Bloodspore	We are witnessing something amazing here, Human. A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz. I have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us. Be wary of their guardians! The kobolds won't give them up easily! 
Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar. You can create Pustulant Spinal Fluid by using a Giant Spine collected from a Pustulant Horror.	Neutralizing the Plague	You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's plague cauldrons, Human. Hunt down the flesh giants at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the plague ineffective. You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits. Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar. 
Kill 6 Primordial Drakes and then speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.	Sharpening Your Talons	The primordial drakes occupy most of the area to the north and east, and I can feel the heat of their breath even at this distance. Before we can challenge the mightiest among the drakes, we must test our skills against the lesser creatures. Still, don't let your guard down; any one of these beasts can devour a man whole. Once you've familiarized yourself with the combat tactics of these drakes, return and I will tell you our next step. 
High Executor Wroth at Venomspite wants you to use the branding iron 5 times on Torturer Alphonse to get the information out of him. After that, kill him.	Torture the Torturer	Enough! I want you to put an end to the torture of my people! The Onslaught's torturer, Alphonse, has been bleeding information out of everyone that gets caught by those fiends! I need to know what they know. My sources tell me that he has set up shop in the basement of their barracks, which is right next to the smithy. I'll loan you my personal branding iron to see to it that the job is done right. Find him and get that information. 
Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim in Conquest Hold.	The Conqueror's Task	The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog. I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine. If I fail, the machine fails. Lumber, ore, water... it's all here and we want it. And so does the Alliance. Before we can move against the human scum, we need to solidify our control over the western region. Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim about eradicating the vrykul in Voldrune and then maybe - if you turn out to not be a complete failure - we'll send you on further tasks. 
Use the Bark of the Walkers to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to Earthwarden Grife at Agmar's Hammer.	Strengthen the Ancients	The ancients of the Lothalor Woods to the south are being corrupted by arcane wyrms... wyrms which have risen out of the ground! Those that are already corrupted are deadly and of no use to us, but most can still be saved. Luckily, the treants of the woods seem to be immune to everything happening up there. Ask the treants for their bark and when you get some, feed it to the ancients. This should strengthen them. Now leave me to my business! I have to keep an eye on these apothecaries. 
King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 8 Horn Fragments from Thunderfall.	In Memoriam	Surely Thorim has told you of the tragedy that divides us. It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place. If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace. Go there, Human. Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day. 
Use the Seer's Crystal at the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip to determine how they died, then return to Crusader Rhydalla.	The Stories Dead Men Tell	The crystal will reveal the truth about how three of the tournament's combatants died. Take it with you to the graveyard east of the Tournament Grounds and use it before the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip. If indeed these men were murdered, then we must find a way to tie it to the Black Knight before he strikes again. Look closely at what the crystal tells you, George, for we must be certain these deaths were not accidental. 
Find the prison inside Inner Hold in Valiance Keep and speak to the deserter.	A Deserter	Unit S... Unit S.... hmmmpph.... don't make any sense... it oughta be named after a town...Darkshire was sent to Dragonblight. The Goldshire boys were sent to the Fjord. Where did I hear...Oh, yes... the deserter! There's a turn-tail in the barracks prison. Got thrown in not too long ago. Kept saying that ""S"" stood for suicide. Look for the deserter. He might have some information for you. 
Katja in Silverbrook wants you to uproot 8 Wolfsbane Roots.	Wolfsbane Root	Have you heard of the wolfsbane plant? It is a horrible weed... it destroys our farmable crops. We spent all of last week cutting them down, but the roots are beginning to sprout again. It might not seem like an urgent matter, but a resurgence of the plant could be a real... disaster. Do you think you could help us by uprooting them where you find them near the village? 
Return to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle with news of Emerald Acorn's effects.	Time Yet Remains	I feel refreshed... renewed... but the plague still grips me. Not to worry, I am still eternally grateful that you went to such lengths for me, a complete stranger. If nothing else, you've bought me a few more precious hours not plaguing the world as a hideous undead. Thank you, Mechanic. Please extend my thanks to Tirion as well, and let him know that it has been an honor to serve beside him. 
Bring 3 Giant Toxin Glands from Giant Tidecrawlers to Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.	Spiking the Mix	I've a feeling the long trip across the sea is affecting the effectiveness of our plague. What is needed is a potent toxin to boost the potency of the strain. The crabs near this beach are a distant relative of the much smaller brown-shelled tidecrawler. The smaller tropical variety produces a paralytic toxin strong enough to knock out an ogre. As we all know bigger is better! The much larger glands on the local variety should prove more potent. Bring me a few! 
Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the D.E.H.T.A. Trap Smasher to free 8 Mammoth Calves.	Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves	They're majestic beasts, aren't they?<Lathorius points towards the mammoths of the northern tundra.>With each passing day their numbers diminish. Demons that call themselves hunters slay the beasts for sport and riches.<Lathorius' face contorts with anger.>It's the whimpers that drive me to madness, George. You can hear them, carried by the wind. The mammoth calves, trapped in the hunters' vile traps, call out to us. Take this hammer and smash those traps. Free the calves! 
Gymer, King of Storm Giants, has asked you to find a way to release him from his cage. Speak with Engineer Reed at the Crusader Forward Camp.	A Great Storm Approaches	You are not like the others, little one. You do not reek of the ancient death. Perhaps you can be trusted. I am Gymer, king of the storm giants. I was lured here by my brother, Thiassi, now an undead servant of the Lich King. By the time I realized that his cry for help was a trap, it was too late. I am now a prisoner of the Scourge and I fear that soon I will suffer the same fate as many of the other storm giants. Find a way to release me from this cage and I will aid you to the best of my ability. 
Sage Mistwalker has asked you to seek out and help Ulfang in the Rivenwood. If you somehow lose the Worg Disguise, return to Sage Mistwalker for a replacement.	In Worg's Clothing	From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood. He is in great danger. I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang. Please, Mechanic, find and help him. 
Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Warsong Battle Standard at Icemist Village and defend it against attackers. Return the Warsong Battle Standard when you are finished.	The Might of the Horde	The taunka are now our brothers in arms. We must show our solidarity and retake Icemist Village. You will find Icemist Village west of Agmar's Hammer, sitting at the foot of the mountains. Travel there and challenge the Anub'ar Nerubians! Plant our beloved Horde banner at Icemist Village and destroy all that dare come to tear it down! Let the Anub'ar feel the true might of the Horde! Let our battle standard be the last thing that they see before death! 
Soar Hawkfury at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to kill 15 Infected Wildlife and recover a Rot Resistant Organ.	Containing the Rot	With Scourge comes death and disease. We often overlook that the wildlife of a Scourge infested area is ravaged and ultimately destroyed by rot and contagion. For most of the indigenous beasts of the Dragonblight it is too late. The festering disease that the Scourge brings has already infected the beasts and they are now rabid and rotting. You must venture west, towards the Pit of Narjun, and cull the infected wildlife. Check their corpses for a preserved organ as we need one to devise a vaccine. 
Go into Nifflevar, north of Ghostblade Post and look for the Saga of the Winter Curse, the Saga of the Val'kyr and the Saga of the Twins.	The Enemy's Legacy	As our armies march through Northrend, our enemies will not suffer mere defeat. Their houses will burn, their corpses will be devoured by our plagues, all trace of their existence will be lost. This worries me as a seeker of knowledge. The eastern town of Nifflevar will soon be razed by our forces in Vengeance Landing. The vrykul bard, Helgus, lived there and wrote three sagas: the Saga of the Twins, the Saga of the Winter Curse and the Saga of the Val'kyr. Obtain them before Nifflevar is destroyed. 
	The Amphitheater of Anguish: Tuskarrmageddon!	This next one's fightin' from a dark place, kid. The kind of dark that can only happen when you've been on the flip-side. He's hungry and willing to do whatever it takes to win. Watch yourself! I've heard he wrestles yetis for exercise! We'll start when you're ready. 
Deliver the Favor of Zangus to Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest.	The Favor of Zangus	An inscription on the back of the favor reads,""To my favorite pupil,If you continue to show promise, I will teach you wonders beyond your imaginings. If you do not, I will have you destroyed! As ever,High Cultist Zangus""No doubt the warden at Stars' Rest will want to see this. 
Confront ""Crowleg"" Dan, who is in one of the ships at Scalawag Point. Speak to Handsome Terry when you've completed this task.	"""Crowleg"" Dan"	Croaker's spoken, matey. ""Crowleg"" Dan's on da ship yonder. Best go trace that blaggard, mon. Show'im dis set's not fe be crossed. Gaan back fe Terry when ye keelhaul 'is behind. 
Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Tuskarr Torch to burn the Kvaldir ships at Pal'ea and Garrosh's Landing. You must destroy the following ships: The Serpent's Maw, The Kur Drakkar, Bor's Hammer and Bor's Anvil.	Burn in Effigy	Tuskarr magic is similar to what your people call shamanism. While we serve the elements differently than you, the power that we are able to call forth is formidable.<Waltor waves a torch-like baton in front of you.>With this tuskarr torch I want you to return to the mist and strike at the Kvaldir vessels. You will find three of their vessels docked behind the mist at Garrosh's Landing, north of here, and one docked off the shores of Pal'ea, to the south. Burn their ships in effigy! For all to see! 
Deliver the Letter of Amnesty to the Captured Trapper in Silverbrook Hills.	Tactical Clemency	Listen, George. I need you to act with discretion and speed. One of Krenna's top sergeants has captured a trapper outcast outside of Silverbrook. Now, if things turn out the way they usually do, the prisoner is going to be executed before the day is over. We can't let that happen. You see, the prisoner matches the description of Mikhail's older daughter in his diary. If we set her loose and follow her closely, she'll lead us to whoever's controlling the trappers. Take this letter to her. 
	A Mission Statement	 
Trapper Jethan at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him 8 pieces of Trapped Prey.	Preying Upon the Weak	Glad to meet you. I've come here from the Grizzly Hills to do business with your cohorts. My people maintain a large outpost there, and you'd do well to visit it when you head north. I've set up traps in the woodlands and snowy areas around here. With the meat and the furs from the creatures they capture, I'll have plenty to barter with the townspeople. I can offer you a share of my profits if you're willing to help gather prey from the traps. Beware though, you won't be the only predator out there. 
Recover 8 Missing Journal Pages, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah.	The Damaged Journal	This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps in the dwarven language. The only text you're able to decipher is the name of Brann Bronzebeard scrawled at the end of one of the entries. The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Someone thought the notes important enough to attempt to destroy them. Perhaps gathering the missing pages from the battlefield will yield some clues. 
Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord wants you to deliver Orfus's Bundle to Elder Atuik at Kamagua.	Elder Atuik and Kamagua	<Orfus bundles up the clues you brought him.>My people are bitterly entrenched in a war with the Northsea Freebooters. If any tuskarr could help us in our quest to right the wrongs of the pirates, it will be Elder Atuik of Kamagua. You must take these clues to him at once. To get to Kamagua you must take the Ancient Lift, behind me. Take the lift directly to Kamagua and find Elder Atuik. 
Captain Arnath in Heb'Valok asked you to collect 7 units of Fresh Spider Ichor from the Trapdoor Crawlers in Zul'Drak.	Stocking the Shelves	Listen, Mechanic. I realize that it's a lot to ask....Fresh spider ichor is somewhat hard to come by, even in these heavily infested regions. But Finklestein said he'd settle for no less than a vat of it, and that he needs it soon. I'll keep my men out in the field collecting reagents, but if the alchemist's order is going to be filled in time, they'll require some assistance. As you roam the fields of Zul'Drak, keep your eyes peeled for trapdoor crawlers and bring me all of the ichor you can find. 
Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to bring him 6 Thick Mammoth Hides.	A Bot in Mammoth's Clothing	I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to Northrend's biting cold. I've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the Geyser Fields. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians! 
Report back to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.	Report to Anselm	Let's send word back to old Anselm then. Victory has come later than expected, but better late than never. Tell him it will take our forces a few hours at most to finish off the stragglers here. Glory to the Banshee Queen! 
Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to bring him 10 Ectoplasmic Residue.	The Forsaken Blight and You: How Not to Die	The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert.<Middleton uncorks a vial and inhales.>See, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo. On the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has dispatched you to slaughter 80 undead in the Weeping Quarry. Speak to him to secure a skeletal gryphon for the assault.	Seeds of Chaos	Effective tool, is it not? Excellent job weakening their defenses, Mechanic. Now we can push the main assault. The plan here is straight-foward - we're looking to destroy anything moving, and get in there and steal some information amidst the confusion. Let me know when you're ready and I'll set you up with a skeletal gryphon. 
Dark Ranger Lyana south of the Vengeance Landing wants you to kill Captain Olster, Lieutenant Celeyne, and Sergeant Lorric at the Derelict Strand.	Landing the Killing Blow	You've proven yourself in the field of battle, George. You might very well have changed the tides in our favor. I've an important assignment for you now. I'm not sure how much longer the weakness we've exposed is going to last, so we must use the element of surprise to our advantage. I want you to use the confusion created by our attack and go behind enemy lines to assassinate their leaders. In order of rank, they are: Captain Olster, Lieutenant Celeyne and Sergeant Lorric. Good luck, Mechanic. 
Bring the Cultist Communique to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn in Valiance Keep.	Further Investigation	I'm afraid this is a matter I must delegate to one of my operatives... someone who can work in secret. Keep the evidence with you and take it to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn. Tell her I sent you and speak of this matter to no one else. We do not know who might be working for the cult. 
Collect 2 Vials of Corrosive Spit from the Jormungar by using the scraper on yourself. Bring the vials back to Zort in the Crystal Vice when your task is complete.	Messy Business	Even at first glance, the sample you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit. It would be a natural assumption that the same substance these worms use to burrow through the ground has allowed them a formidable weapon against the Ice Giants. Take this scraper and pick a fight with some of the worms. When they spit on you, use the scraper to remove it and bring it back to me. Get me a couple samples - I'm going to have to use it as the base for an elixir. 
Deliver McSorf's Bundle to Stanwad at the Explorers' League Outpost in Howling Fjord.	The Explorers' League Outpost	It's all a bunch of cryptic nonsense! Even with this cipher I can't make heads or tails of these tablets. Admittedly, cryptography is not my strong point. You'll need to take the cipher and tablets to our cryptographer, Stanwad. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from Stanwad in two weeks. He took a team of twenty scientists to the dig sites on the southeastern bluffs of the fjord and hasn't been heard from since. The best I can do is have McGoyver over there give you a lift with his flying machine. 
Retrieve the Colossus Attack Specs and Colossus Defense Specs and bring them to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.	A Colossal Threat	You've done an excellent job of delaying the work on the iron colossus, but I fear we've only made the stormforged more determined to complete the weapon. Even now, they're bringing in new laborers and the overseers push them to the limit. We may not be able to keep them from bringing the colossus online, after all. Return to Narvir's Cradle, to the south and find the documents detailing the colossus' offensive and defensive abilities. They should be near the tents and forges on the bottom level. 
Travel to the Blight Line, between Rainspeaker Rapids and the Lost Lands in Sholazar Basin and seek the Avatar of Freya.	Force of Nature	I'm not sure about what I saw while flying to the northeast, but to me it looked like a gigantic woman kicking some Scourge butt. I'd heard the professor talk about a certain ""lifewarden"" appointed by the titans to look over Sholazar. I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill. I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead. What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand? 
Elder Atkanok, on the outskirts of Coldrock Quarry, wants you to free the spirits of 3 Kaskala Craftsmen and 3 Kaskala Shaman.	The Lost Spirits	In the attack on the quarry, the shaman and craftsmen working here were slain. The violence threw the spirit world into utter chaos and we'll be unable to guide the ancestors home unless we find a way to soothe the spirits of the murdered. The aggressors themselves pay no heed to the spirits, but their companions, the beryl hounds, sense the spirits and hold them in thrall. Kill the beryl hounds, and using the raw energy left behind, break the imprisonment of the spirits of the innocent. 
Speak to the taunka at Westwind Refugee Camp and make 5 of them pledge their allegiance to the Horde. Return the Blood Oath of the Horde to Emissary Brighthoof once you have completed this task.	Blood Oath of the Horde	They are ready, George. These taunka will all willingly join the Horde and give all that they have to see the Scourge driven from this world.<Brighthoof hands you a scroll bearing the insignia of the Horde.>Within this scroll you will find the blood oath of the Horde. Tradition dictates that our new taunka brothers and sisters utter the sacred words herein. Take the scroll and swear the taunka into the Horde, commander. Return the scroll to me when you have completed your duty. 
Creteus in the Foot Steppes has provided you with the information to locate Norgannon's Core.	The Hidden Relic	During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the dwarf Brann Bronzebeard. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent... I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created. Norgannon's Core is located in the Frigid Tomb to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, Human. 
Colvin Norrington at Dorian's Outpost wants you to take 5 Hydra Sputum Samples and kill 5 Bittertide Hydra.	Burning to Help	There's no more caustic material in all of the basin than bittertide hydra sputum. I've got special containers to collect just such a thing for Archmage Pentarus' studies. Now all I need is a brave, um... collector. You look like a hardy, adventurous Mechanic. How'd you like to make a bit of money and aid Dalaran's cause at the same time? All you need to do is take this container with you to Bittertide Lake, to the southwest. Engage the hydra and use the container to sample the sputum they shower you with. 
Look for clues wherever the fall takes you.	A Short Fuse	As you light the fuse, you notice that it is consumed by fire far quicker than you would expect. The bombs are about to go off and your best chance at surviving is to lean towards the pit and hope the fall doesn't kill you. 
Kill Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer and recover Kaw's War Halberd. Deliver Kaw's War Halberd to Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra.	Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer	You cannot defeat the being responsible for the slaughter of my kind by yourself. The mammoths of the tundra will help you! Venture forth to the plains and find a mammoth bull. He will allow you to mount him and control his movements and actions. Ride upon his back and find Kaw, north of here at Kaw's Roost. Together, you will be the instrument of Kaw's demise. Destroy Kaw's armies and take from Kaw his coveted war halberd. Return to Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment should you succeed. 
Acquire 4 Jormungar Egg Sacs and bring them to Savinia Loresong at the Argent Tournament Grounds.	Breakfast Of Champions	Now that the coliseum is complete, the Argent Crusade has asked us to help look after the creatures that champions will be fighting. The giant jormungar have perhaps the strangest diet; they grow strong by eating the eggs of their own kind and the best eggs come from deep jormungar. Take this drum to the Foot Steppes in central Storm Peaks and play them near the snow mounds you see there. Rouse the deep jormungar, kill them, and gather their egg sacs. 
Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Khit'rix the Dark Master. Should you succeed, speak with Gjonner the Merciless overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas: Khit'rix the Dark Master	A variety of beings travel the world to prove themselves within Valhalas. Some even come from under the world. Khit'rix the Dark Master is one such. Hailing from deep within the ground where insanity reigns, Khit'rix has asked for someone exotic to face in the ring. You will do. Dare you face this Nerubian nightmare, Human? 
Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle.	The Gearmaster	Gearmaster Mechazod is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves! George, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east. The last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff. You must confront Mechazod if gnomes everywhere,... no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive! 
Inform Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor about the wrecked crab trap.	Signs of Big Watery Trouble	This crab trap appears to have been destroyed by something much larger than the nearby circling sharks. Perhaps Tua'kea, the fisherman at Moa'ki Harbor, should be told about this? 
Gather 6 Inventor's Disk Fragments and use them to assemble the Inventor's Disk.	Pieces to the Puzzle	Thank the Light that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the iron dwarves, I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on Norgannon's keystone, which guards access to Ulduar's archives, but the Titans divided it into two pieces and secreted them away. One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the Inventor's Library on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians. 
Speak with Officer Van Rossem in Dalaran over Crystalsong Forest.	Hero's Call: Icecrown!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Officer Van Rossem in Dalaran over Crystalsong Forest. The Valiance Expedition needs more adventurers to bolster their assault on assault Icecrown Citadel and Arthas himself. It is time to make the Lich King pay for his crimes. Glory to the Alliance! 
Glrglrglr inside the Winterfin Caverns has asked you to retrieve Urmgrgl's Key.	Keymaster Urmgrgl	I have to get out of these caverns! There's magic stuff seeping in from Coldarra, above, and affecting everyone's minds. I don't intend to be controlled like these others! Keymaster Urmgrgl is in the cave below and to the south. He holds the key to my cage. Get it from him and bring it back so that I can unlock my cage and get out of here. Hurry! 
Retrieve the crystal defenses at Sparktouched Haven and use them to kill 50 of the nearby Frenzyheart wolvar. When these tasks are complete, return to Lightningcaller Soo-met in Sparktouched Haven.	Mastery of the Crystals	Sparktouched are still being attacked by puppy-men... we think they maybe not stop if we not make them stop. We have secret weapon though... we sent it out to Soo-met so he can use to protect all Oracles. Secret weapon is from Great Ones themselves... extra shiny crystals found inside sacred Great One temples. Be very careful... no break them. Crystals are in chest near shrine at Sparktouched Haven, in far southwest. You go use crystals to help Soo-met beat the puppy-men. 
Barblefink at the Alliance base in Venture Bay wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115.	Seeking Solvent	Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket....Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean. Tell ya what, Human. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent. Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble. 
Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Rokir, the Rider of the Unholy.	The Rider of the Unholy	It's time that we start cutting off the heads of the beast. I served beside Rokir for quite some time. He knows the unholy arts better than most any other death knight I've met and he's equally as ruthless. Rokir's strengths are most apparent when you are fighting him on his own ground. Sadly, we don't have much option in those regards, but stay on your feet to avoid his undead minions and you should come out victorious. Be nimble, Mechanic, and do not take him lightly. 
Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra has said that he will reward you should you bring him 15 Nesingwary Lackey Ears.	Ears of Our Enemies	Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports Nesingwary and dares to strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of D.E.H.T.A. Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A. 
Take Norgannon's Shell to Lagnus at Frosthold.	Aid from the Explorers' League	Interesting. I don't see any locking mechanisms on the shell. That suggests to me that it may take more than just finding the other piece to combine the keystone. Take the shell back to the expedition leader, Lagnus, at Frosthold. Once he gets over his awe, he should be able to glean what the core looks like based on the shell, and maybe they can get the Frost Dwarves to help find it. I'm going to see if I can find out how to combine the two pieces. We'll catch up once we've both made some progress. 
Bring 5 Intact Cobra Fangs to Oracle Soo-rahm, near the Bones of Nozronn.	An Offering for Soo-rahm	We not know you, stranger, but we know you want something. We will talk to Bones of Nozronn for you, but you must bring us offerings. We need powerful emperor cobra fangs to complete our oracle's necklace. Go to the Wildgrowth Mangal, northeast of our hut, find cobras and bring back best fangs. Then we make bones speak to you. 
Elder Atuik wants you to obtain 3 Chimaera Horns.	Arming Kamagua	Issliruk, the spirit of war, is depicted as a silver eagle by my people. Our stories tell of how Issliruk fought against a hundred worgs to save his young. It is time for us, too, to fight against our foes to save our brethren. We will need to craft new weapons. The horns of the frostwing chimaera that make their home in the snowy parts of the island are sharp and are easily crafted into spear tips. Bring me the best of these horns that you can find. 
Deliver Imperean's Primal to Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.	Return to the Spirit Talker	You have done what was asked, and now I give you that which you desire. Deliver this primal to the spirit talker back at your Bor'gorok Outpost. If she is wise, she will know a ritual to gain you the information which you seek. 
Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Reinforced Net to help you slay 6 Scourged Flamespitters outside of Valiance Keep.	Death From Above	We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs. Some of these cheeky fiends, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses. I've requisitioned reinforced fishing nets from our civilian ships. If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky. Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep. 
Return the Sacred Artifact to Lord Irulon Trueblade at Valgarde.	Guided by Honor	<Ares smiles.>Glory to the Light. You have done it!<Ares coughs.>Take the artifact and return it to Valgarde. Lord Irulon Trueblade awaits its return. Fight with honor, friend. Always. Honor.<Ares dies.> 
Capture 12 Chicken Escapees for Elder Harkek. If you lose Dajik's Worn Chalk, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	Flown the Coop!	Dumb Goregek stumble into chicken house and let all the chickens go! They all around hill - go get chickens back!<Elder Harkek shoos you away.> 
Bring Dahlia Suntouch's Ruby Brooch to Krasus in the Ruling Council Chamber at Wyrmrest and inform him of Dahlia's fate.	The Fate of the Ruby Dragonshrine	As you pick up the brooch, its faint glow brightens slightly. Krasus will want to know of Dahlia's fate. Take the brooch to him at Wyrmrest. 
Deliver the Frigid Timewarped Prism to an interested mage in Dalaran.	The Unstable Prism	As the prism struggles to stabilize in a single time flow, it bleeds a shadowy chill, the likes of which you haven't felt since Northrend. Surely some mage in Dalaran would be interested in this relic. 
Bring the Breath of Alexstrasza to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown.	The Boon of Alexstrasza	You must understand, young Human, that cleansing the body in favor of life anew is something well within my grasp... removing the plague of undeath without affecting the body, however, is beyond the scope of the powers that I control. If this Bridenbrad is the beacon of light that you profess him to be, perhaps he will endure such a cleansing and thrive, but I cannot state with confidence that this is the salvation that you seek. Take it and go with all of my blessings. 
Speak to Karuk about the Captured Tuskarr Prisoner.	Cruelty of the Kvaldir	I thank you for saving me, George. The kvaldir are animals! They made us fight the other prisoners. It would've been more merciful to just kill us all. The youngling Karuk is still alive -- I noticed him arrive here. Tell him his father fought until the end. 
Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to identify 3 Shango Tracks from the Dreadsaber Tracks near Bittertide Lake.	Dreadsaber Mastery: Stalking the Prey	I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call Shango. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp. If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints. 
Collect 5 Functional Cultist Suits for Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest.	Kill the Cultists	The Anub'ar cultists are indirectly responsible for the plaguing of the beasts, and we must put an end to it! The fumes that emit from the cultists' suits seep into everything they come near, poisoning and corrupting their surroundings. You must go north to Icemist Village and slay them. Bring back any of their suits that survive your assault and I will see to it that they are properly disposed of. 
Deliver Quarterflash's Package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.	Understanding the Scourge War Machine	We must take solace in the fact that Slinkin's death, while tragic, was for the greater good. His discovery coupled with your heroics in the mine and the samples you returned brings us one step closer to understanding the Scourge war machine. Take this package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. It holds a sample of the strange ore and my analysis. 
Imperean wants you to beat Simmer and Churn into submission. Return to her at the Ruins of Eldra'nath when they have submitted.	Boiling Point	Ah, it is information that you crave: the whereabouts and condition of your 'farseer'. He did not see so far as to avoid the trouble which befell him. Nevertheless, I will give you the means to acquire the knowledge. But first, you will do some things for me. No doubt you have seen the war between fire and water to the south. Simmer keeps boiling Churn's pool, and the two have been battling for ages. Go to the Charred Rise and Blistering Pool, and convince each of them to stop their bickering. 
Report to Legion Commander Tyralion at the 7th Legion Front in central Dragonblight.	Chasing Icestorm: The 7th Legion Front	You need to get to the 7th Legion Front in northern Dragonblight. Return to Wintergarde Keep and take the north gate out of town. Keep north until you hit a road. Take a left on that road and follow it until you reach the snowline. Once at the snowline keep heading west until you hit the Path of the Titans. Follow that north and it'll lead you right into the 7th Legion Front. Once there, speak with Legion Commander Tyralion. He'll be expecting you. And George - it has been a pleasure. Farewell. 
Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Kvaldir and recover 8 Tuskarr Relics.	Into the Mist	Across the mist to the north you will find Garrosh's Landing. To the south are the ruins of my old home, Pal'ea. Both have been ransacked by an ancient force known as the Kvaldir. These fearsome savages slew all of my people without mercy and drove your people inland. All that remains of the tuskarr of Pal'ea are our personal effects, taken as relics by the Kvaldir. While we are not a vengeful race, justice must be served. The tuskarr relics must be returned to me. Enter the mist and find them... 
Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp wants you to raise an army of 100 Ghoulish Minions.	Army of the Damned	You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines. That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them. I saw the prince do it himself. I can show you how it happened... if you'd like. 
Smear the Blood of Loguhn upon yourself and then return to Elder Ko'nani at Moa'ki Harbor.	Slay Loguhn	Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, Loguhn must die! He's the alpha male of the Snowfall Glade tribe and one mean wolvar. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays. You will find the ""Render of Flesh"" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect. 
Sergeant Thurkin told you to speak to Samir at Granite Springs.	Good Troll Hunting	Good for nothing wretches! They could have had it easy. We extended our hand in peace. All they had to do was give us passage through Drak'Tharon and we'd have let them be. But no, the prideful little ice trolls decided that they wanted it rough. Now they'll be destroyed and we'll pass through their precious keep to Zul'Drak anyway. We've contracted a gang to deliver us captured trolls. Talk to Samir if you want in on the action. You can find him to the northwest of here, due south of Zeb'Halek. 
Search the Spire of Blood for more information about the Vial of Fresh Blood.	The Spire of Blood	As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm. The victim must have just been bled and may still be alive. What use would the Scourge have for blood? They've never shown an interest in live prisoners in the past. Perhaps if you can locate the source of the blood, you'll be able to discover what the Scourge is planning. 
Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use the Smuggled Solution at the Broken Front. Using the solution will require an Abandoned Helm, Abandoned Armor, and Pile of Bones, all found at the Broken Front.	Borrowed Technology	I get it, I get it. Cappy's too busy to see this for himself. His loss! See, I've managed to 'acquire' a certain shipment of solution from the enemy. And as much as I hate tinkerin' with inferior goblin technology, I'm inclined to make an exception here. Take this sample. I'll need you to run a few field tests, just to prove its usefulness, while I try to do a little reverse engineering to duplicate the creation process. Go to the front and gather the materials to make a decoy, then use the oil. 
Use the Lorehammer on Taunka Relics to attune it to the time of Stormhoof. Once it has been attuned to 6 relics from the time of Stormhoof, return to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.	Where Time Went Wrong	The Lorehammer can help us correct the damage to the timeline, but only if we can discover where the history was originally corrupted. From Chieftain Swiftspear and your findings at Frostfloe Deep, we know that the change happened around the time of Stormhoof's death. Now, you must go to the Howling Hollow, north of the camp, and inspect the gravesites the North Wind's minions have already destroyed. The Lorehammer will react to artifacts from Stormhoof's era and attune itself to the proper time. 
Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 5 Bloodspore Moth Pollen.	Pollen from the Source	It's obvious! The bloodspore moths are the entities responsible for pollination on these plains. It must be something that happens within the moth's internal system that acts as a catalyst for this pollen to work. It's all starting to make sense now, George. That's why the kobolds don't kill the moths and instead go to great lengths to protect them! Those stupid little rats have it all figured out! Well we'll just have to get our own moth pollen! What do you say? Fetch me some in the name of science? 
Wind Tamer Kagan at Camp Winterhoof wants you to kill 8 mountain elementals. You may kill either Howling Cyclones or Iceshard Elementals.	Suppressing the Elements	If you are to survive here, as we have, you must learn to face the environment's challenges head on. The elements will claim your life if you're not vigilant, as the proliferation of elementals in these northern hills shows. We must cull the elementals one last time before we can leave this place. Are you willing to aid us while we continue to make preparations? You must kill any iceshard elementals or howling cyclones you encounter in the snowy hills surrounding the outpost. 
Ricket at K3 wants you to kill Gnarlhide.	Expression of Gratitude	I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a gnoll problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable. It all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that ""ends"" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in Snowblind Hills. And when I say ""pay him a visit,"" that's a euphemism for ""kill him painfully."" Kay? Kay! 
Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to search for Black Conrad's Treasure on the plateau in the northeastern end of the Isle of Spears, just north of Iskaal.	Dead Man's Debt	You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts. Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights. He had a thing for not paying, too. I'd love to collect, but trouble is... he's dead. I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this...<Taruk unfolds a map of the Isle of Spears with an X on a northeastern plateau.>He hid his treasure on tuskarr land. I want you to get it. I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying. 
Charge your War Golem with the energy from 10 Lightning Sentries and return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.	... Or Maybe We Don't	You'd think the guys making the power cells would've thought to power them up, but no, they've got to make it difficult for us. Fine, we'll charge those cells the hard way. There's enough power in them to run the golem for a short time, but don't expect it to be any good in combat. You see the lightning sentries that the irons have posted around the perimeter of Dun Argol? Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, and use the golem to absorb the power as the sentries die. 
Soo-nee at Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to use the Didgeridoo of Contemplation at the top of the Glimmering Pillar, the Suntouched Pillar, the Mosslight Pillar and the Skyreach Pillar.	Song of Reflection	Of course you not as smart as gorloc! You just simple Human. You not without hope, though! You show you can learn. Maybe crystals make you smart like crystals make us smart! I teach you to play song to clear your mind. You play song by crystals then crystals make your mind better... not as good as gorloc's but better than you have now. Lifeblood Pillar is broken, but other pillars still good! 
Seek out Shadowstalker Ickoris at the Warsong Farms Outpost west of Warsong Hold.	Reinforcements Incoming...	<Hellscream shakes his head.>You may not have noticed that we're trying to win a war here, Human. I need all available soldiers at the primary points of conflict. This means that we don't have any real soldiers to spare for these minor incursions.<Hellscream pauses to think.>If Barthus wants reinforcements at the farm...<Hellscream claps his hands together.>...he shall have them! Report to Barthus's assassins at the farms, west of here. Let them know that reinforcements have arrived. 
Bring 4 Marks of the Champion to Luuri at the Argent Tournament Grounds. If you lose your lance, you can get another from any of the Lance Racks near the stables or in the Sunreaver Pavilion.	Among the Champions	As a champion, you have mastered the art of mounted combat, besting challengers of all levels. When the tournament begins, those you have defeated will have redoubled their efforts and will seek to avenge their losses. It would be wise to continue honing your own skills and learning from your opponents. Champions representing all cities practice in the Ring of Champions. Equip your lance, mount up on any mount you're entitled to use at the stables, and face the champions. 
Sergeant Kregga at Icecrown Citadel wants you to slay 10 Hulking Horrors.	Establishing Superiority	We've one shot at dealing some damage to this place -- let's make sure we get it right. We've acquired potent, Scourge-made, saronite bombs. But we must secure this area before we can set them off. We're going to need to get the Scourge defenses under control quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Help my men out and come back when you're ready for some fireworks. 
Look for Vic's Keys inside the lake at River's Heart.	An Embarrassing Incident	There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out. You see, I can't seem to find the keys to my flying machine. I've looked pretty much everywhere for them... maybe you can give me a hand. Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake. I'll even give you my very own air tank. It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left. 
Alchemist Finklestein at Heb'Valok wants you to assist him in the creation of a truth serum. When you are ready to begin, you are to speak to him and follow his instructions.	Troll Patrol: The Alchemist's Apprentice	Ahh, you must be the promised patrol. Your timing couldn't be better. I have urgent need of an extra pair of hands. We have a Drakkari prisoner who's been sent here to undergo questioning. Before the interrogation begins, I require assistance in the creation of a truth serum. Creating a truth serum is tricky business, demanding keen instincts, perfect timing, and improvisation at every step. Let me know when you're ready, Human. And remember, timing is everything! 
Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to construct 8 Barricades using your Barricade Construction Kit.	Raise the Barricades	When our forces begin to move beyond Aldur'thar, they will be vulnerable to attack from the Ironwall Rampart and the broad glacier below. We have neither the time nor the materials to build fortifications, but we can put up some barricades to shield our men from fire and break up Scourge charges. Take this barricade kit to the Valley of Fallen Heroes, on the west side of Aldur'thar. Locate the markers I've placed there and use this kit to construct your barricades there. 
Speak with Valnok Windrager at Agmar's Hammer.	Attack by Air!	They have seen the might of the Horde by land, now they must feel it from the air! I want you to report to Valnok Windrager at once! You will find him here, in Agmar's Hammer. Valnok has already been briefed on your mission and is expecting you. 
Defeat Trainer Grrglin in a pet battle.	Trainer's Test	<The oracle finishes peering into the pearl and turns to face you. She appears to be deep in thought, staring directly at you and blinking a few times. Finally, she nods. The oracle points at you, then points upwards. She places a hand a small distance above the ground, indicating something pet-sized. Your surmise that there may be test of your connection with your battle pets ahead.> 
Kill 6 Sapphire Hive Wasps and 9 Sapphire Hive Drones for High-Shaman Rakjak in Frenzyheart Hill. If you lose Dajik's Worn Chalk, speak to Elder Harkek in Frenzyheart Hill.	The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice	Rakjak not dumb. Maybe you good at killing things. Maybe Frenzyheart can make you into real hunter. Dajik hunts giant wasp things better than all wolvar. Go with Dajik to Sapphire Hive to southeast or to river in south and learn the hunt. 
Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to kill Keeper Witherleaf.	Keeper Witherleaf	You have been a great friend and ally to us, George. There is one more thing I must ask of you. You have seen the corruption of the Twisted Glade and the beasts that dwell there. The blacksouled keepers will continue raising these abominations from the waters and soil of our glade unless we act against them. The most powerful of the blacksouled keepers is known as Keeper Witherleaf. Slay him, George, and open the way for the redemption of the glade as you once redeemed my sisters. 
Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates.	The Runic Prophecies	Brann's journal also contained a guide to iron dwarf symbols. I've inscribed these on a keystone which will help you to understand the words inscribed on the rune plates. From the journal entries, it seems Brann may be chasing after clues to the origins of his people. Keep your eyes open for any clues as to his destination. Return to Thor Modan, northeast of here, stand before each of the plates, and use the stone to determine the contents of each. We can't allow the Alliance to find him first. 
Return to Rainspeaker Canopy and speak to High-Oracle Soo-say.	Return of the Friendly Dryskin	Yay! Soo-say probably worrying about us! Maybe you go back to town and tell him everything okay? Yeah, go tell Soo-say. I going grab shiny ball thing from dead lich guy - I meet you there! Go go! I meet you there! 
Look for William Allerton inside the Farshire mine.	Thassarian, My Brother	I recently received word from William Allerton, a family friend, that my brother enlisted here in Valiance Keep on the same day he did. Thing is... my brother's been dead for years. I sold everything I owned to come looking for Thassarian, only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy. I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around. I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you. If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the Farshire mine. 
Salvage a bottle of Kul Tiras Wine from the underwater shipwreck northeast of Valiance Keep and bring it to Old Man Colburn in the Valiance Keep inn.	In Wine, Truth	The military was all that old man Colburn had. After he retired, he still clung to it like a lifeline. He knows the name of every general, unit, brigade, detachment... you name it. He's the man you need. Problem is, his mind is scarred. He won't talk to anyone unless he gets his Kul Tiras wine. Takes him back to the times he was a marine. I haven't received a shipment in months. The last merchant ship out of Kul Tiras sunk northeast of here. See if you can salvage a bottle to bring Colburn. 
Dismantle Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip.	Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty	Okay, I think we're ready for the penultimate assault... before you can bring down Mechazod, you're going to have to dismantle his lieutenants first! You'll find Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder at the West Point, North Point, Mid Point and South Point stations, respectively. To get them to show up, just turn the valves at the stations to mess up whatever they're trying to do out there. You can't miss the places, they all have spinning lights. 
Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. Then, return to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.	Necro Overlord Mezhen	The Scourge are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the vrykul into Arthas' fold. I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated! Do whatever it takes, George, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized. I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge! Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron. 
Speak to Ricket to make use of Ricket's D16 Propelled Delivery Device to enter further into Storm Peaks.	When All Else Fails	So... so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains. Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening. Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.<Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.> 
Sage Edan at Camp Winterhoof wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the Broken Tablet.	The Lodestone	We must find what's luring the giants northwest, so we can stop them before they reach their destination. While the rune samples gave us some clues, the unknown runes worry me. When I visited Giants' Run, I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of Frostblade Peak. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn about the identity of this lodestone. 
Defeat Grimkor the Wicked and return to Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker.	The Ironwall Rampart	The Ironwall Rampart overlooks the Valley of Fallen Heroes, west of Aldur'thar. The rampart dominates the fields below on all sides. We will not be able to advance if the rampart cannot be taken, but it is held by Grimkor the Wicked and his Cult of the Damned disciples. If you can weaken Grimkor, our forces will know what to expect as we advance. Take this rune of distortion. Unleashing its power near Grimkor's orb at the end of the rampart should be enough to get the necromancer's attention. 
Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to obtain 8 pieces of K3 Equipment in Sifreldar Village north of K3.	Equipment Recovery	Please, George. When the Hyldnir took our men, they also took all our equipment. Of course, it's more important that we get our boys back, but if you run into any of our equipment, I'd really appreciate it if you brought it back to us. You'll find their village just above us, to the north. 
Njormeld in Dun Niffelem needs you to use the Diamond Tipped Pick on the Dead Iron Giants at Frostfield Lake and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes.	Forging a Head	Greetings, Human. I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people. I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies. Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields. 
You are to feed Arngrim 5 Disembodied Jormungar, then return to Arngrim's frozen image in Dun Niffelem. You must go to the Valley of Ancient Winters and use Arngrim's Tooth on the Roaming Jormungar there. Once they have become disembodied, you must fight them until they are weakened.	Feeding Arngrim	Arngrim's hunger was legendary. Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl. It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king. No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand. 
Watcher Moonleaf at Steel Gate has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the Frostblade Shrine.	The Cleansing	Of late I've had nightmares concerning a worg named Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him. However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way. But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation. There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain. Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me. 
Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to place the Alliance Banner in Baleheim and then defend the banner against attackers. Return to Lieutenant Icehammer with the Alliance Banner should you survive.	Drop It then Rock It!	I'm not about to put the fate of this mission into the hands of some untested scrub. Now, if you want to prove to me that you've got what it takes to carry out this mission, you'll need to do what I tell you. Take this battle standard and head over to Baleheim, directly north of here. Once you're at Baleheim, find the center of town and drop our flag. Fight off any vrykul dirt bags that attempt to take down our beloved flag and return to me once you've established Alliance dominance! 
High-Oracle Soo-say at Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to give a peace offering to Shaman Vekjik and then return with his response. If you lose Lafoo's Bug Bag, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	Making Peace	We have great idea. You were friends with puppy-men, they maybe listen to you. We want you to go give offering to Shaman Vekjik. He southwest where river turns into waterfall. Tell puppy-man we no want fight. Tell him we play nice. You good Human. We trust you do this right. 
Ride 5 Highland Mustangs back to Squire Percy at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.	Mounting Up	Cap'n Stoutmantle left most of our calvary... cavlary... uh, horsemen at the fight for Venture Bay. We chose a good place to put the camp 'cause there are tons of highland mustangs running around near here and in the Boulder Hills to the northeast. The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em. Will you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp. Pick the carrots and use them with the stick to lure in the mustang, then ride it back here. 
Return the Westguard Command Insignia to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.	All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!	We -- well, you -- have done everything that we were sent here to accomplish <sir/ma'am>. I must say that it's been a pleasure taking orders from such a fine, young Human. The captain is sure to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I am at your disposal. 
Defeat the Storm Tempest and then return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.	Master the Storm	From what you describe, the creatures of metal should be easy to deal with. But first, you must master the storm. Behind me in the lodge is a totem. When you are ready, focus your will upon it and the storm will come. You must defeat the storm and in so doing take its essence into yourself. If others are there, it is enough that you all work together to defeat it. Return to me after, Mechanic. 
Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.	The Missing Bronzebeard	Before we left, I received the file Scout Vor'takh compiled on this Brann Bronzebeard. There can be no doubt that Brann was headed for the Storm Peaks from his journal entries and findings in Grizzly Hills. Before we crashed, I caught sight of a campsite south of here, across the Foot Steppes, and overlooking the frozen Bor's Breath River. If Brann isn't there, search the camp and its environs for any clues as to where that blasted dwarf might've gone. Bring back anything you find. 
Bring Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment a cask of Howlin' Good Moonshine.	Softening the Blow	Our best bet for moving our forces quickly to Icecrown Glacier lies with the network of tunnels beneath the ancient iron dwarf city of Thor Modan. Brugar Stoneshear and his Explorers' League boys aren't going to be happy, but orders are orders. The news might go over better if you brought him a cask of that moonshine sold by that trapper, Hugh Glass, down at Redwood Trading Post, southeast of here along the tree line. Man's not right in the head, but you won't find better moonshine out here. 
Get a Shiny Knife from ""Silvermoon"" Harry and capture a Scalawag Frog. Bring these to Zeh'Gehn at Scalawag Point.	A Carver and a Croaker	Some of the pirates around here... we have our own special way of talking. Zeh'gehn has... many different special ways of talking... all mixed together. From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife.""Silvermoon"" Harry might have a knife on the cheap. There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife. I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean. 
Agent Skully has asked you to acquire The Diary of High General Abbendis and to deliver it to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.	The Truth Will Out	We have to figure out what's going on here. We need the general's diary! I'm pretty sure that you'll find it on her nightstand upstairs at her house. It's the one next to church, across from the stables and the lumbermill. Once you acquire the diary, take it to the high executor back at Venomspite. You'll have to do this the old-fashioned way; the power of the mirror is low and there's only enough left for me.<The agent smirks.> 
Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to enter the world of shadows and defeat 6 Shadowy Tormentors. Speak to Koltira Deathweaver should you need to re-enter the world of shadows.	The Power to Destroy	While you have done much for me, one task remains. Beside the world you know exists another world. It is from that world, the world of shadows, that my tormentors assault me. While I am powerless to face my own demons, you could end their reign of terror. You have the strength, I have seen it with my own eyes. Enter the world of shadows and face the demons that torment me! Do this and I will translate the tome, as promised. 
Elder Atuik at Kamagua in Howling Fjord wants you to obtain 6 pieces of Island Shoveltusk Meat from Island Shoveltusk in the Isle of Spears.	Feeding the Survivors	We tuskarr rely mostly on our fish catch for sustenance. In times of great need, however, we will on occasion hunt land animals. The nearby village of Iskaal was recently attacked by pirates and the survivors just keep pouring in. Our catch has been modest this week, but there are many shoveltusk on the island and their meat is plentiful. Aid my people by hunting these great beasts and obtaining their meat. 
Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use her Container of Rats to pick clean the corpses of 15 Scarlet Onslaught members at New Hearthglen.	Let Them Not Rise!	I don't understand it. The blight should have worked! No sense worrying about it now.<The apothecary seems relieved for some reason.>Though it doesn't work on the Onslaught for some strange reason, we still need to keep their priests from raising them. I have another idea, one that their corpses shouldn't have any protection from. George, take a container of my rats and unleash them upon any Onslaught corpses you come across at New Hearthglen. I starve the vermin, so they should be voracious! 
Gavrock, at the Ruins of Tethys, wants you to neutralize the four Runes of Compulsion by defeating Overseer Durval, Overseer Korgan, Overseer Lochli, and Overseer Brunon.	Runes of Compulsion	Even as Kurun attacks Thor Modan, the iron dwarves work their magics against our brothers. Summoning our brothers from the earth, then binding them with runes, the sons of iron force them to war against the children of stone. Along the Eastwind Shore, they use runes of compulsion to send enslaved giants to the battlefields of the north. Find the four runes of compulsion and force their overseers to appear by defeating the rune-weavers who man each rune. Without the overseers, the runes are useless. 
High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to rescue 6 Trapped Wintergarde Villagers.	Rescue from Town Square	Just down this path here is Wintergarde's town square. Once a hive of activity for the citizens of Wintergarde, now a warzone, filled with murderous geists hell-bent on vengeance towards the living. In the buildings surrounding the town square are trapped villagers that must be rescued! I ask much of you, now, George, but you are the only soldier I can spare. Free our people. Take this path down into town square and enter those houses. Kill anything that gets in your way! Return to me should you survive. 
Speak with Hugh Glass and Gavrock about Loken, then report your findings to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.	In the Name of Loken	The iron dwarves stand as one of the fiercest and most coordinated foes in Northrend. Wherever we have traveled, they have battled us with the name of Loken on their lips. We must learn who this Loken is and what he seeks. The locals may be of help. To the northeast, at the Redwood Trading Post, a human named Hugh Glass peddles his wares. Further east, at the Ruins of Tethys, you'll find a stone giant named Gavrock. Ask them about this Loken. They've got to know something of use. 
Shadowstalker Ickoris at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to scout Warsong Granary, Torp's Farm, and Warsong Slaughterhouse.	The Warsong Farms	According to Luther's notes the Scourge is now using this place as a breeding ground for those monsters you see lumbering across the field.<Ickoris shudders.>Those monsters were once orcs... tauren...We need more information before a plan can be devised. I want you to investigate three sites that are heavily trafficked by Scourge: the Warsong Granary, southwest of us, Torp's Farm, directly west of us, and the old Warsong Slaughterhouse, north of us. Return to me once you've scouted 'em out. 
Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault would like you to assassinate 20 Restless Lookouts.	Honor is for the Weak	Ghouls are fragile things when it comes down to it, and the lookouts at the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest are no exception. Using one of the shades, I have no doubt that you can sneak up and put down their lookouts without making a sound. Clear out as many lookouts as you can reach in a reasonable amount of time... we'll want their ranks thinned for our assault to come. 
Captain Adams has asked you to use the Westguard Command Insignia at Skorn, and then to speak with the Westguard Sergeant.	Operation: Skornful Wrath	George, I must now ask you to undertake an operation so hazardous, so deadly, that only you can see it through. The vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits on our eastern border. My scouts inform me that those 'giants' are poised to strike us, and with my forces scattered all over the fjord, I don't have the men to take the place by force. Instead, you're going to use your cunning. I've sent a sergeant ahead with the details. Show this command insignia at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and follow your orders. 
Escort the Skybreaker troops to the gates of Ymirheim. Return to Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim for compensation after the task is complete.	Assault by Ground	Greetings Mechanic. Our troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these vrykul are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men. If you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us. 
Search the Utgarde Catacombs for Glorenfeld.	And Then There Were Two...	There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt:""Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets.""Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs. 
Return to Ricket at K3.	Demolitionist Extraordinaire	You've got some swift feet on you sonny! Thanks for lending a hand with those explosives... I've been waiting to give that invention a good test run for a while! Go ahead and tell Ricket we should be covered on the magnataur front now... my sappers will clean up any of the remaining baddies. Thanks again! 
King Jokkum wants you to bring Hodir's Horn Fragments to Njormeld in Dun Niffelem.	A Monument to the Fallen	Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument. May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years. May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at Thorim's side. Go now, Mechanic. Njormeld awaits you. 
Take a zeppelin to Northrend. You can board the Howling Fjord zeppelin in Tirisfal Glades, or the Borean Tundra zeppelin in Orgrimmar.	Wrath of the Lich King: To Northrend!	The Lich King stirs in the north. An undead army follows his command, marching across Northrend and spreading blight wherever they tread. We need you to stop them, George. 
Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Abwa.	The Blessing of Zim'Abwa	I am heartened to see the zeal with which your Argent Crusade is dealing with the Scourge, Human. I would like to help with your efforts. The Drakkari trolls of this once-great city used to make regular offerings to their gods, but now neglect them, or worse. If you were to make offerings to the gods, they would show their appreciation in return. Zim'Abwa's statue is just to the southwest. Zim'Abwa would gladly accept your offerings of Drakkari artifacts as a sign that you are protecting Zul'Drak. 
Speak to Bat Handler Camille and take a riding bat to intercept the Alliance reinforcements. Once above their fleet, use the Plague Vials to infect 16 North Fleet reservists.	Test at Sea	We've just received word of reinforcements coming to the aid of the Alliance forces. Their timing couldn't be better! We're in sore need of test subjects and these North Fleet reservists will do nicely! Take these plague vials with you and speak to Camille, the Bat Handler. Tell her you need to commandeer a riding bat for a special assignment for us. Once you're at sea, drop the vials on the reinforcement fleet. I can't wait to see the results! 
Go to the nearby Saronite Bomb Stack to light the fuse.	Blow it Up!	This is probably as under-control as this situation is going to get. Let's do this, George. I need someone to light the fuse on those bombs and it looks like you're the one to do it. 
While weakened by the Power of the Storm, destroy any 15 of the robotic units, except the mechagnomes, in the greater pools area surrounding the Fizzcrank Pumping Station. Afterward, return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.	Weakness to Lightning	You now have the power of the storm within you. I will give you the means to focus that power and weaken the robots in the pools. Take this lightning rod. Use it against the robotic creations of the mechagnomes you find within the greater pools area to the west. Do not worry about using it against the mechagnomes themselves; Greatmother Taiga has other plans for them. Once the robots are weakened by the power of the storm, dismantle them utterly! 
Bring Norgannon's Core to Brann Bronzebeard in the Engine of the Makers.	The Master Explorer	Combining the keystone will require Norgannon's Binding - a device located in the Engine of the Makers, the large pit beside us. Brann should be down there with the other half of the keystone now. I have instructed him on the use of the device. He awaits your presence. I will do what I can to keep the iron dwarves occupied, but I do not have confidence that I will hold them for long. King Stormheart is returning to the defense of Frosthold with some of his men shortly. Please hurry, Human. 
Blood Rejek's Blade on the corpses of a Sapphire Hive Wasp, a Hardknuckle Charger, and 3 members of the Mistwhisper Tribe. You may blood the sword on either Mistwhisper Oracles or Mistwhisper Warriors. Return to Rejek at Frenzyheart Hill when your task is complete.	Rejek: First Blood	Rejek just became youngest warrior in all of Frenzyheart tribe. Father gave Rejek a mighty sword to defeat Frenzyheart enemies, but old tradition say sword need to be blooded first. Older warrior usually do that. You do this honor for Rejek? Take blade, put in corpses of all Frenzyheart foes: wasps and hardknuckles to southwest, and the big-tongues. Maybe blood blade on Mistwhispers, far to northwest near Bittertide Lake. 
Deliver the Blight Specimen to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in eastern Dragonblight.	To Venomspite!	I got a special bat all lined up for you, buddy. Fastest and smoothest ride I've got. He'll take you right to Venomspite - in style. Just hand that vial over to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton once you land. 
Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability while standing near the Iron Dwarf Relic. Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.	Iron Rune Constructs and You: Collecting Data	The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal. Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data. 
Speak to Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post.	Fate and Coincidence	There are two types of people in this world, George. Those who believe in coincidence and those who don't. On the day I lost my eyesight I was given the gift of clairvoyance. I suppose you can guess what sort of person I am. Earlier today, a young woman named Sasha was granted the same vision you were. You will want to talk to her. You'll find her directly east of here at the White Pine Trading Post, on the way to Solstice Village. 
Harbinger Vurenn wants you to fight the Cultist Necrolytes near Farshire to the north of Valiance Keep and retrieve the Cultist Communique from them.	Enemies of the Light	Not so fast there. I don't know about you, Mechanic, but I was hardly convinced by the general's words. They rung unsure... as if they were not his own. Something's amiss here. All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed. It is time we took a more independent approach. If we're to learn more about the cultists inside the keep... perhaps we should investigate those outside. Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the Scourge north of here. See if they carry any clues. 
Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill 10 Loot Crazed Divers.	Happy as a Clam	To the west of us you will find Lake Kum'uya. It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world. Of course Nesingwary's lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species. Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made! 
Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Tormak the Scarred at Camp Oneqwah.	Bringing Down the Iron Thane	Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol. When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm. That construct, called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol. The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level. 
Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy 5 vats of Embalming Fluid and 5 Blood Orbs.	Spill Their Blood	The Scourge cannot create their flesh monsters without blood and embalming fluid to preserve the parts and keep them functioning. If we can deny them these materials, their army will fall apart and we can easily destroy their creations. Throughout the labs where the flesh giants and abominations are cobbled together, you will find vats of embalming fluid and large orbs filled with blood. Destroy these, and bring death to any who would stop you! 
Farmer Torp at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to rescue 8 Infected Kodo Beasts.	Bring 'Em Back Alive	Take this riding snaffle, George. You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here. Bring my babies back, George! One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle. 
The Winterhoof Brave suggests that you use the Brave's Torch to set fire to the Northeast and Northwest Longhouses and the Barracks at Skorn.	Burn Skorn, Burn!	Chieftain Ashtotem ordered me to destroy many buildings here. However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, George. I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch. 
Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Harpoon Control Mechanism.	Locating the Mechanism	Don't worry, George; this is all going to lead to something big! HUGE! You're just going to have to trust me for now and do as I ask of you. We need to get the mechanism mentioned in the manual for the next step of the plan. I have a strong suspicion that you'll find one on one of those vrykul that operate the harpoon guns in Wyrmskull Village. You'll find them on the east side of the village, on the docks by the longhouses. 
Bring the Emblazoned Battle Horn to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in assessing the potential threat.	Disturbing Implications	The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a Magnataur. Take the horn south down the Path of the Titans to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications. 
Travel to Mistwhisper Refuge and speak to Mistcaller Soo-gan. If you lose Jaloot's Favorite Crystal, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.	Back So Soon?	<High-Oracle Soo-say stares at your forehead for a while before speaking.>Soo-gan ask for help. We think they might have been attacked by puppy-men again. We sending you and Jaloot to help... follow west river up to Mistwhisper Refuge. Do what Soo-gan says... hit the puppy-men on the nose if they being mean, they don't like that.<High-Oracle Soo-say goes back to staring at your forehead as you leave.> 
	Frenzyheart Champion	 
Hidetrader Jun'ik in Conquest Hold wants you to get 3 Gray Worg Hides from Graymist Hunters in the woods to the north.	Gray Worg Hides	Let me tell you something, mon. When you get put in charge of outfittin' the armies of the Horde, you go through a lot of hides! Conqueror Krenna, the she-wolf runnin' this place, she gave me a tight deadline. If I don't outfit her whole regiment by week's end she's gonna have me wrestling bears in the pit. Help me out and I'll pay you top price. I'll be needin' hides from graymist hunters. You'll find them all around in pockets to the north, hunting stag. Remember, mon. Top price! 
Find Prospector Khrona's Notes and Prospector Soren's Maps at Brann's Base-Camp.	Going After the Core	With Norgannon's Shell in hand, only half of the archive key remains to be found. Luckily, I've had the Explorers' League hard at work chasing down leads about the whereabouts of Norgannon's Core. Far to the southeast of the Inventor's Library, on the slopes to the north of Dun Niffelem, is a camp bearing my name. The Explorers' League representatives seeking the second half of the key are based there. Bring me the maps and the notes they've made and we should be able to track down the other key half. 
Yord ""Calamity"" Icebeard at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to kill Necrolord X'avius, Necrolord Horus, and 15 Naxxramas Scourge.	Breaking Off A Piece	Just down the steps lies the gateway to damnation: Scourge as far as the eye can see and getting thicker with each passing moment. What little intelligence we've been able to gather indicates that two Scourge necrolords are furiously working at emptying the first two crypts down below. Before we can breach the inner chamber to Thel'zan, we'll need to take care of those two clowns and their Naxxramas cronies. Go down into the mausoleum and take out the necrolords and the Naxxramas dreadguards and shades. 
Sergeant Stackhammer at the Altar of Sseratus wants you to speak with 10 of his Argent Soldiers and tell them to report back to him.	Argent Crusade, We Are Leaving!	<The sergeant quickly reads through the orders you've handed him, a frown coming over his face.>Look, <lad/lass>, I'd love to just up and leave, but take a look out there. All of my people are fighting. Tell you what, you've come this far, you think you're up to doing me a small favor? Head out there and round up my soldiers? Tell 'em that the sergeant orders them to report back immediately. Lend them a hand if you will. 
Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Sapph, the Rider of Frost.	The Rider of Frost	Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile. I have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow overconfident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly before shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks. Do not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her. 
Return the Orders From Drakuru to Crusader Lord Lantinga at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak.	Orders From Drakuru	Minions be hearin' da call of your masta! Da Lich King be givin' Drakuru full control of da armies of da Scourge in Zul'Drak. We be commanded ta kill everyting. EVERYTING MUST DIE! We be processin' all da corpses in da Dead Fields and sendin' em up ta Prince Navarius' crew in Zeramas for Scourgin'! Notin' goes ta waste on Drakuru's watch! Soon we be drinkin' da blood of da prophets ta become stronger dan eva before! Zul'Drak and Gundrak gonna fall to da Scourge! 
Disguise yourself as an Iron Rune Overseer, intercept the message from Loken, then report to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.	Put on Your Best Face for Loken	Using the images you've captured, I've created everything you need for your overseer disguise kit. You'll make a fine iron dwarf, if I do say so myself. Take the kit with you to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city. There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication. 
Chief Engineer Copperclaw wants you to use Copperclaw's Volatile Oil at the Broken Front to attract 3 Frostbrood Skytalons. To use the oil, you must collect a Pile of Bones, an Abandoned Helm, and Abandoned Armor from the battlefield there.	Volatility	Where to begin... well, you must know that as chief engineer of this vessel I have access to all of the intelligence reports - yes, yes, it's true, and I've recently taken a particular interest in the frostwyrms you reported seeing to the south, and I do believe I've developed a plan that just might work against them... now it'll take a little legwork on your part, but essentially, you build a dummy out of armor and coat it with a splash of this solution, then run for cover!...You still here, Human? 
Collect 8 of Tua'kea's Crab Traps and return them to him at Moa'ki Harbor.	Tua'kea's Crab Traps	With all of the troubles, I've lost my assistants. I was wondering if maybe you could help me? I have many crab traps under the waves of the harbor. Will you retrieve them for me? I'm too old for that sort of thing and the waters can be very dangerous. Please, take this bladder. It will help you to breathe while you're down there. 
Slay Magister Keldonus and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.	WANTED: Magister Keldonus	By decree of Overlord Agmar:Target: Magister KeldonusCrime: TreasonStatus: AliveMagister Keldonus, once mage commander of Agmar's Hammer, is to be killed on sight in the name of the Horde. Keldonus was last seen traveling southwest towards Moonrest Gardens to join the blue dragonflight in their campaign against magic. Approach with caution as Keldonus is a powerful magus. All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer. 
Listen to what the Avatar of Freya has to say.	Freya's Pact	The cultists have been taken care of, but the Scourge's invasion has not slowed down. The situation is becoming desperate, George. There exists a last resort. Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust. 
Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to speak to Orsonn at the Ragefang Shrine and Kodian at the Heart's Blood Shrine.	The Bear God's Offspring	It is possible that the furbolg of Grizzly Hills have the same taint that plagued Vordrassil. They've been involved in a deadly tribal war recently after years of peaceful coexistence. The shrines that they guard to the east are home to Ursoc's offspring. If the corruption has affected the furbolg, it is possible that because of their lineage, Kodian and Orsonn have remained unharmed. If that's the case, find them and listen to what they have to say. 
Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Sigrid Iceborn. Should you succeed, speak with Gjonner the Merciless overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid Iceborn	An old foe of yours has returned: Sigrid Iceborn. Perhaps you remember besting her in a duel upon the Savage Ledge? No matter, she certainly remembers you. She's insisting upon a chance to prove herself once more. Personally, I think it's more a chance for revenge, but that too can be useful in this place. I leave it up to you, George. Will you face Sigrid Iceborn once more? 
Use the Smoke Flares at the location of the Alliance Cannons on the northern wall of the Derelict Strand. Report to Dark Ranger Lyana at the Bleeding Vale after you've completed this task.	Guide Our Sights	We should be able to kill our way back to our guns. Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground. Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out. Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops. We can take care of ourselves over here. 
Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. Afterward, inform Greatmother Ankha at Camp Winterhoof of your success.	The Walking Dead	Your assistance to us has been tremendous, George, but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge. The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with! Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to Gjalerbron and destroy the unnatural Scourge in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the Waking Halls below Gjalerbron as well! 
Speak to Matthias Lehner at the Court of Bones.	Time for Answers	You have a lot of questions, George. You're the only one who can see me because you touched something that once belonged to him... don't you remember? You don't know what it is? Well I can't just tell you... that would make him really mad. He's not just a prince anymore... he's the king! Meet me at the Court of Bones, north of Icecrown Citadel and you can see for yourself. 
Take Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace to High Overlord Saurfang at Warsong Hold.	What the Cold Wind Brings...	You hold the carapace fragment of Ith'rix the Harvester and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the Horde. Take your trophy and present it to High Overlord Saurfang, inside Warsong Hold. He should be notified of your victory over a powerful Scourge agent. 
Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to investigate the Black Knight's Grave.	The Black Knight's Curse	I wanted to remove the Black Knight's remains from the tournament grounds after your victory, but Confessor Paletress insisted that he receive a decent burial. Ever since, a dark presence has lingered in the cemetery and people are afraid to go there to visit the fallen. Would you visit the cemetery just past the eastern end of the tournament grounds and see if you can discover what's happening? 
Dorain Frosthoof at Taunka'le Village wants you to use the Windsoul Totem to gather the energy of 10 Steam Ragers.	The Power of the Elements	I kept trying to tell that silly goblin his machines are unreliable. But the power of the elements; that is deep and abiding. When my apprenticeship is over, I will wield their full power. What I know now should be sufficient to help out our friend Fezzix, though. Take this windsoul totem and plant it near any of the steam ragers to the west of the village. The totem will gather up the energies of slain elementals. Return the fully charged totem to me and I'll do the rest. 
Speak with Crusader Lord Lantinga in Zul'Drak.	Warchief's Command: Zul'Drak!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Crusader Lord Lantinga in Zul'Drak. The Scourge is massacring the local population in Zul'Drak and converting them over to be part of the Scourge army. Assist the Argent Crusade and the Ebon Blade in stopping this threat. For the Horde! 
Destroy Arcanimus and then return to Ethenial Moonshadow at Moonrest Gardens.	End Arcanimus	There is one last thing that I would have you do, George the Human. I would have you destroy Arcanimus! The sorcerers to the west used that giant device in the sky to bore a massive pit into our resting place. When they did that, they unleashed a monstrosity! I would not care if it were only a concern for mortals, but Arcanimus feeds upon the spirits of the dead. You will put an end to it now! 
Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Archaeologist Andorin at Frosthold.	On Brann's Trail	After the discovery of Brann's journal in Grizzly Hills, we've only had one other communication from Brann. A mysterious note found its way to Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search. From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the Bor's Breath River and at the foot of some ruins from the Path of the Titans. 
Speak with Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.	Let the Baron Know	The most important thing that you can do right now is to return to The Shadow Vault and let Baron Sliver know that I've failed. You see, I wasn't the only one captured by these vrykul devils. My entire contingent of death knights was also taken. I should have seen the trap before it was sprung, but there's no use crying over spilled milk now is there? Go on before you get captured, too! I'll see you back at the vault. 
Bring 5 Elemental Hearts to Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village.	The Heart of the Elements	Now that we know the exact locations of the nerubian sinkholes, we can collapse them to halt the Scourge offensive and cripple their force. Wind Tamer Barah knows a way to harness elementals to destroy the tunnels the Nerubians are using, but she will require your help. Southeast of the village, near the coast beyond the Frozen Reach, you'll find an area dominated by frozen earth elementals. The hearts of these elements are exactly what Wind Tamer Barah will need. 
High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to defeat Drottinn Hrothgar.	Drottinn Hrothgar	The Kvaldir, seafaring vrykul who raid ships and coastal settlements, have overrun a tuskarr island across the strait to the north. Their leader is a veteran raider, Drottinn Hrothgar, who seeks to control these seas. With him in power, our shipments and troop transports will never be safe. We will be stranded here at the Lich King's mercy. Take this captured Kvaldir war horn to the circle of tuskarr statues on the northeastern part of Hrothgar's Landing and use it to challenge the Kvaldir leader. 
Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Thane Banahogg, the Deathblow. Should you succeed, speak with Gjonner the Merciless overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.	Battle at Valhalas: Thane Deathblow	Your skills have not gone unnoticed by the vrykul of Jotunheim, George. Thane Banahogg has taken a personal interest in you and has insisted that he be your next match. If you thought Carnage was bad, then you might want to go home now. Thane Banahogg's nickname is The Deathblow. I think you can guess how he earned it. Do you accept the thane's challenge? 
Koltira aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to go to Aldur'thar and defeat Overseer Faedris, Overseer Savryn, Overseer Veraj, and Overseer Jhaeqon.	Chain of Command	Based on your report, and my knowledge of the Cult, they have an overseer managing the operation of each encampment on the gate. While taking their leaders down will only be a temporary setback, it will at least slow them down and keep them off-balance. And that, Human, is a worthy enough goal for now. Seek out these overseers and return to me when they have been dispatched. 
Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to collect 5 Demolisher Parts from the Scavenging Geists in the Valley of Lost Hope and take them to the Wrecked Demolisher.	Field Repairs	The Scourge is still reeling from our attack, George. Now is the time to capitalize on our momentum. The strategically important valley below us is wide open. We've located a disassembled demolisher vehicle in what we believe is working condition in the southeastern corner of the Valley of Lost Hope area. If you can get the remaining parts from the Scourge scavengers, you should be able to get it running again. A single working demolisher can wreak havoc on the enemy's ground units. 
Return to Rainspeaker Canopy.	Home Time!	You're a good dryskin. Mistwhisper safe, treasure safe, and puppy-men sure to leave us alone now. You go back to Rainspeaker Canopy and tell Soo-say you done good. 
Speak to Zeh'gehn at Scalawag Post.	A Traitor Among Us	Our second in command, Annie Bonn, has been acting rather paranoid as of late. She seems sure we have an infiltrator in our ranks, can ye believe it? Anyhow, we have a foolproof way of uncovering rats around these parts. See, good ole' Zeh'gehn over here happens to be an authentic witch doctor. His family hails all the way from Zul... something or other. Go let him know that we're in need of his divination skills. I must warn ye, George, only one or two of us can understand anything Zeh'gehn says. 
Recover Stormhoof's Spear and Stormhoof's Mail and return them to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.	The Hero's Arms	Not all of the camp's records have yet been corrupted. My staff has helped me to find those records which reflect the true timeline. They agree that Stormhoof was given a burial of honor among the village elders on the bottom level of the Howling Hollow, to the north. Most of the graves there have already been destroyed, their contents taken as trophies by the North Wind's subjects. Go to the hollow and see if you can recover Stormhoof's spear and armor from the scions of storm who have claimed them. 
	Remember Everfrost!	 
Bring 8 clods of Scourged Earth to Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.	The Bad Earth	By curing the hides with the blighted earth outside the Temple City, Sage Aeire believes she can create a cloak which will cause most of the Scourge minions to ignore your presence. You should blend right in, she says. She'd best be correct. It's our only chance to gather information and plan our counterattack. You should be able to find the earth she needs poking in the areas to the south and west of the fortress. Bring it to me when you've finished gathering it. 
Speak with High Executor Wroth at Venomspite in Dragonblight.	The High Executor Needs You	It's a good thing that I intercepted this request from High Executor Wroth before it got to Overlord Agmar. What is Wroth thinking?<The sergeant rips up the letter that he's holding.>Mechanic, go see what it is that the high executor wants. Follow the road east and pass through The Dragon Wastes. You'll find a path leading up out of the wastes on the southeast side, and the Forsaken town, Venomspite, will stand before you on the south side of the mountain. 
Slay Captain Brightwater and report to General Khazgar at Venture Bay.	Crush Captain Brightwater!	With every advance, our men are met by fresh Alliance reinforcements. It's almost as though their commander anticipates my every move! The time has come for good Captain Brightwater to meet his end. He commands his troops from aboard an Alliance destroyer at the far end of the bay. This will be no easy fight, George. Take along a couple of trusted friends, or if you have a key to one of those repaired shredders, use it to disembowel Brightwater! Either way, he must fall! 
Investigate the area surrounding the Fizzcrank Pumping Station. Then, return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.	What Are They Up To?	The gnomes have run into some trouble in the pools to the west. It serves them right as they have been fouling up the land with their so-called inventions. I want you to go out to their pumping station and observe what has befallen them. Return to me after. 
Search Wyrmskull Village for Zedd.	Zedd's Probably Dead	To whomever finds this journal:These bloodthirsty monsters have taken up residence in the ruins of Wyrmskull. What they want or why they're here is a mystery. In any case, the artifacts are not safe with those beast-men around. Zedd and I made a new discovery while hiding out: a cipher to decode the tablets! Unfortunately Zedd and I were separated late last night. He had the cipher. Tablets were with Glorenfeld and Daegarn. Location unknown...Find Zedd.-Pulroy 
Scout Knowles has asked you to retrieve the Apothecary's Package from inside Halgrind. Once you have it, return to the scout at the Ember Spear Tower.	Mission: Package Retrieval	Well darn, we need some of that plague-stuff. I know! While you were destroying the vats, I happened to spy one of the apothecaries from New Agamand being pulled into Halgrind by the vrykul down in there. Poor fella'. George, I'd bet anything that apothecary has the goods on him. Think you could go into Halgrind and retrieve his package? 
Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to kill 15 Venture Company members. You may kill either Venture Co. Ruffians or Venture Co. Excavators.	Venture Co. Misadventure	Ever since we arrived, the Venture Company has hampered our efforts to secure our campsite and survey the area. Normally, we wouldn't care what they were up to, but they've started antagonizing our scouts and shooting down supply flights. We can't allow this insult to stand. Hemet Nesingwary's expedition came here to hunt, and hunt it shall. Go to Swindlegrin's Dig, on the far side of the crystal pillar to the northeast, and kill any Venture Company employee you see! 
Kill 20 members of the Scarlet Onslaught and report to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.	WANTED: The Scarlet Onslaught	By order of High Executor Wroth all members of the illegal organization known as the Scarlet Onslaught are to be put to death immediately. No quarter is to be offered, and those proceeding to action upon this decree should be aware that any who are captured by the humans will be left to die, or worse! In the High Executor's words, ""Paint the snow red with their blood!"" 
Kill 6 Burning Depths Necrolytes and 10 Smoldering Skeletons outside of the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Return to Serinar once the task is complete.	No One to Save You	We will spare no one. Outside, lowly necrolytes and their skeletal servants shame my land with their presence. Slaughter them all. 
Talk to Archmage Pentarus when you're ready to leave for Sholazar Basin. When you arrive, speak with Monte Muzzleshot in the Wildgrowth Mangal of Sholazar Basin.	Sholazar Basin	Hemet Nesingwary was last heard from leading an expedition into the jungle depths of Sholazar Basin. His expedition has not been heard from since. Monte Muzzleshot is a pilot who was dispatched to provide them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either. Archmage Pentarus in Dalaran is standing by with a flying machine to take you to the last known location of Monte Muzzleshot. 
Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Vordrassil's Heart, Vordrassil's Tears and Vordrassil's Limb and use the Geomancer's Orb in the depths beneath the surface.	The Darkness Beneath	Something... dark... happened to the tree Vordrassil. After the druids decided to destroy it, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground. I want you to go to the three locations to the northeast where the tree's trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can. Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area. This might shed some light on what happened to Vordrassil and why it failed to become a world tree. 
Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower and return to Tactical Officer Ahbramis in Wintergrasp.	Southern Sabotage	The three towers south of the Wintergrasp river are draining power from the Fortress! Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower, then return to me. Remember, only siege vehicles can damage a tower, so make sure to protect them from the Horde! 
Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to use the Map of the Geyser Fields to mark the locations of the South Sinkhole, the Northwest Sinkhole, and the Northeast Sinkhole.	Scouting the Sinkholes	Fizzcrank sent out an aerial surveillance team to map the Nerubian sinkholes in the southern part of the Geyser Fields, but they haven't yet returned. I can't afford to wait any longer for their information, so I'm going to need someone to check out the sinkholes on foot. I understand the dangers involved, and I'll compensate you accordingly. Take this map with you and record the vital information about each of the sinkholes you encounter out there. 
Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect Orbs of Illusion from Bitter Initiates at Aldur'thar and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.	Drag and Drop	Looks like those initiates are increasing in number again. You know what to do...At the southern portion of the gate, the new cultists are being trained. They're certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion. These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy. Slay the fools until you find some, then use them on the subjugators there. 
Blow Hodir's Horn over 5 Niffelem Forefathers and 5 Restless Frostborn corpses at Thunderfall.	Hodir's Call	You have done a great service to the giants of Dun Niffelem. Without your aid, this monument would not exist. As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images... as well as a sense of urgency. The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest. As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn. 
Speak with Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station in Wintergarde Keep.	Naxxramas and the Fall of Wintergarde	Lord Fordragon has led a crushing assault against Arthas at the Wrathgate. In response to this affront, Arthas has sent Naxxramas down upon us. While Kel'Thuzad hides in the floating citadel, his ground commander, Thel'zan, lays siege to Wintergarde Keep. The lower village is already lost and any chance of extracting survivors from the ruins diminishes by the minute. We must act quickly! Report to Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station at once! He'll get you up to speed. Leave me! 
Speak with Grezzix Spindlesnap.	Grezzix Spindlesnap	The pirate thieves have set up port at Scalawag Point, far to the south. Unfortunately, they have fortified their camp with many deadly defenses. There is someone that might be able to assist us in infiltrating Scalawag. A pirate mercenary by the name of Grezzix Spindlesnap recently came to our village in search of food and shelter. In exchange he gives us information about our enemies and feeds them misinformation about our attack plans. Seek him out at his ship just off the coast here - southwest. 
Aumana at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to use the Renewing Tourniquet on 10 Wounded Skirmishers.	Overwhelmed!	You there, Mechanic! Help me! We're losing valuable lives! There are simply too many wounded for me to tend to alone. If we can't get our soldiers healed we could be run out of Grizzly Hills altogether! Take this tourniquet and use it on the wounded down on the battlefield. Hurry, George! They're dyyying!! 
Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold wants you to slay 8 Silverbrook Hunters and their leader, Vladek, at the Forest's Edge Post.	My Enemy's Friend	If there is one thing I can get through your head, let it be this: the Alliance will be crushed in the Grizzly Hills. There is far too much lumber, ore, game and strategic territory for us to give up on any single battlefront here. So far we've been successful... but there's something that could tip the scales in our enemy's favor. Far to the east of here, at the Forest Edge's Post, local trappers seek to join the Alliance. Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so. 
Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. Afterward, inform Father Levariol at Westguard Keep of your success.	In Service to the Light	Your service has been exemplary, George, but there is something that is troubling me: the Scourge. The Light cannot abide their presence, and neither shall we. I hope that it is not asking you too much, but I would have you return north to Gjalerbron and crush the unholy Scourge in that vile lair! Be sure to check for them in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron as well. Purification is the key to salvation, my child. Make us proud! 
Speak with the statue, Elder Mana'loa, at Indu'le Village.	Elder Mana'loa	My people....<The mystic is on the verge of breaking down.>While your spirit was flying through the village, I sensed that Elder Mana'loa took notice of you. George, he wishes to speak with you. The stone elders are revered by us as fonts of ancient wisdom. The elder must want to help. Seek him in the northwest corner of the village. 
Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple.	Informing the Queen	<The dragon steward pulls your letter of introduction out of his sleeve.>Yes... yes, I think that you are ready to see the queen now. When you are ready, speak to me again and I will see to it that one of these drakes delivers you safely to the top of the temple. You will need to present your letter in person to Queen Alexstrasza. 
Seek out the assistance of Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight.	Orik Trueheart and the Forgotten Shore	I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, George. Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the Forgotten Shore. Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You will meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He will be expecting you. 
Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to take the Verdant Torch and use it to burn Vordrassil's Sapling. Bring Vordrassil's Ashes back to Windseer Grayhorn.	Destroy the Sapling	The furbolgs' work must be undone, George. The best of intentions do not count for much when the result is tainted by such strong a corruption. The sapling must be destroyed, for it is the source of this dark influence. Take this torch and use it to set fire to the corrupted sapling and bring me its ashes. Once cleansed, by fire, I will use what power I can to remove the taint from them. You will need the ashes to purify Ursoc from the evil power that holds sway over him. 
Take Thel'zan's Phylactery to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight.	Finality	Thanks to your heroics, Lord Fordragon has given the command to launch a full assault against Thel'zan. 7th Legion have made their way into the summoning chamber of the mausoleum and located what appears to be a gateway to hell. The only piece that's missing now is you. Take the phylactery and report to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum. There is a tunnel that the Scourge dug out just outside the keep that you can take to get to Yorik quickly. Go now, George! Lead us to victory! 
Har'koa has asked you to use her whisker on the corpses of her children to free and resurrect them. Return to her at the Altar of Har'koa when you are done.	But First My Offspring	I am the last of the gods to be subdued, so we must first attempt to free the others. Bound by the magics of my subduers, I am unable to discern their fates. But first, I would ask that you do me a kindness. Already the Drakkari turn my magic against me. They have transformed my offspring into monstrosities. Take one of my whiskers. Slay my tortured children and use the magic of it to release them from their nightmare, and bring them back to life. 
Matthias Lehner wants you to obtain 3 Faceless One's Blood.	Time to Hide	You shouldn't have touched it. But now that you did, he's going to come looking for you. And he'll find you. Unless you hide yourself from him. Bring me blood from the faceless ones if you want to live! 
Collect 4 Ice Shard Clusters from Ice Elementals in the north and bring them to Zivlix at Nozzlerust Post.	Shaved Ice	I've never seen you before... are you new to the Vice? Glad to have you. I could always use some more hands. You get the materials, I'll finish my machine, then we can sell it to those commander types and all go home rich. I actually have most of the primary components, so I just need some of the materials for the weapon itself. Narf said that jagged ice shards from those elementals to the north would make perfect shrapnel for my bombs - go nab some, will ya? 
Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to kill Iron Thane Argrum.	Into the Breach	If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city. The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance? 
Deliver the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders to Agent Skully at New Hearthglen.	The Spy in New Hearthglen	I have a spy within the ranks of the Scarlet Onslaught. I need you to deliver these daily orders to her so that she can plan the next phase of our assault. She goes by the name of Agent Skully and she's under a magical guise to appear as the Onslaught's cemetery caretaker. Here, take these orders to her, and then do as she asks. You'll find the graveyard on the side of the abbey. 
Use Neltharion's Flame to douse the summoning area in the back of the Maw of Neltharion. Once you get the attention of Rothin the Decaying, kill him, then return to Serinar at the front of the cave.	Neltharion's Flame	With the cult's ranks thinned and some of their power stripped, it's time to strike at the source of the corruption. Rothin the Decaying is resurrecting black dragons as magmawyrms in the back of the cave. Go to the summoning chamber and cleanse the remaining bones in the only way that will ensure that they will never be toyed with again... with flame. Burning the bones will surely gain Rothin's attention, see to it that he is destroyed as well. The magic in this vial should see the task done. 
Lurz at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cogs, 3 Notched Sprockets, and 2 High Tension Springs.	Making Repairs	Twenty shredders by noon tomorrow! Who makes these schedules, anyway? No one who ever put one of these garbage cans back together, that's who....If I'm going to hit my quota, I'll need a hand. Help me out and I'll share my commission with you - fair enough? I need cogs, sprockets and springs. They're littered across the ground down by the shredders. 
Take Glorenfeld's Package to Beltrand McSorf at Valgarde Port.	Return to Valgarde	'Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe.<Glorenfeld wraps the cipher and tablets in a tattered cloth.>Take these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find. As for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece! 
Fringe Engineer Tezzla wants you to kill Bombardment Infantry, Gargoyle Ambushers, Frostbrood Sentries and Scourge War Machines.	Amped for Revolt!	George, only our best pilots are given a mission like this, one deep, deep into enemy territory with only the power of infra-green technology to protect you! Request another bomber from Rizzle, and this time fly it through the Valley of Lost Hope. You have both air and ground targets on this mission, so keep your eyes open and your shields at full! Good luck! 
Speak to Annie Bonn at Scalawag Point.	Meet Number Two	All the good work you've done for us hasn't gone unnoticed, George. Our second in command, the delightful Annie Bonn, is incredibly impressed with what you've done so far and wants to meet you. 
Soo-nee at Rainspeaker Canopy wants you to go to the Stormwright's Shelf, northwest of the Maker's Perch, and play the Horn of Fecundity near 8 piles Soaked Fertile Dirt.	Song of Fecundity	The storm is a destructive force. Storm burns trees. Storm floods houses. But storm can also be life force if you know right song. In Stormwright Shelf, above Maker's Perch, you can find small dirt mounds. They very fertile -- they carry inside a strong seed. All they wait for is the right song. You take this horn and play song for them. 
Speak to Envoy Ducal in Silverbrook.	An Exercise in Diplomacy	We'd been trying to negotiate with the trappers for weeks, but we'd gotten nowhere until you found that blasted chest of theirs. This should be good news to our envoy in Silverbrook. We sent Ducal there about a week ago and his last letter indicated he'd been making little progress. Go to Silverbrook and aid him in his diplomatic efforts. Take the roads heading northwest of here and you should find it after crossing a couple of bridges. 
Bring Mikhail's Journal to Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold.	Mikhail's Journal	From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail. It is written in some variant of the common human tongue. Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna. 
Speak to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.	The Invasion of Gammoth	Hellscream assigned Mighthorn and I with the daunting task of magnataur extermination on the southern front of Warsong Hold. With us came an entire platoon of seasoned Horde soldiers. Our initial foray into the nearby magnataur dens proved quite unsuccessful as our entire squad was wiped out by the lair defenders. We're the only ones left...We aren't scientists or researchers. We're soldiers of the Horde, just like you. Soldiers on a mission that cannot fail...Speak to Primal Mighthorn now. 
Explore the Pit of Narjun and return with your findings to Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer.	From the Depths of Azjol-Nerub	The undead Nerubians that attacked Icemist Village came from a gigantic sinkhole known as the Pit of Narjun. If left alone, those fiends will no doubt flank our forces at the Wrathgate and end our march to victory. I need eyes on the ground, George. You are to head west and investigate the Pit of Narjun. We need to locate their primary exit point and seal it off! Find me that location. 
Return to Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer.	Futility	Do you see now? Sending your men against the prince's armies just swells their numbers. I don't expect you to understand... you'll probably just end up like the others. You'd best return to whoever sent you. They might be worried. 
Go east to Death's Stand, just beyond Unu'pe.	The Son of Karkut	The man you seek went far to the east, to a place near the coast called Death's Stand, beyond Unu'pe. Be careful if you go in search of him, George. He bore the mark of Karkut... he who watches over the dead. 
Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker.	Let's Get Out of Here	The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off? 
Find Sage Highmesa near the Dens of Dying.	Sage Highmesa is Missing	There are many new mysteries walking the lands now. One of our sages, Highmesa, has foolishly gone north with only one longrunner to investigate something strange near the Dens of Dying. What are the dens, you ask? They are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die. She saw something fall from the sky near them a few days ago. If you would be friend to the taunka, I would have you find and help her. She is not so stubborn that she will not accept your aid. 
Speak with King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat.	King Mrgl-Mrgl	This is the weirdest thing, Mechanic, but there's a murloc asking for our help! He goes by the name of King Mrgl-Mrgl, leader of the Winterfin murlocs. It would seem that he and his people have been run out of their village and they want someone to come save them. That someone is you! You'll find Winterfin Retreat, and the king, by heading west down the road until you come to the cliffs. Head down to the water line near the Blistering Pool. 
Find Elder Muahit in Kaskala.	Muahit's Wisdom	Listen, George. Warriors like me are replaceable. If I fall, my brothers and cousins will pick up my spear and fight. My people cannot survive without wise elders. Stubborn Muahit, our most venerable shaman, refuses to leave the altar to Tayutka in the central island. We would suffer a significant loss if he was slain by these monsters. You are an outsider, maybe he'll listen to you. Show him reason... ask him to flee to the safety of Unu'pe before it's too late. 
Use the Abomination Assembly Kit in Halgrind and round up plagued Vrykul with your Mindless Abomination. Slay at least 20 and return to ""Hacksaw"" Jenny in New Agamand when you're done.	Warning: Some Assembly Required	Well, here you are! Our friend's going to be somewhat... unstable. So I suggest not putting him together until reaching Halgrind. Once you're there, use the abomination to round up as many vrykul as you can before self-destructing. Come back with whatever's left once you're done. I can always use more body parts! 
Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault wishes you to plant 15 Ebon Blade Banners near the corpses of vrykul found within the greater Jotunheim region.	Leave Our Mark	We must attack the vrykul of Jotunheim on many levels. Brute force, of course, is good, but I prefer a more cerebral approach. I want you to demoralize them. My men here have forged a number of banners for you. I would like for you to take and plant them near the corpses of fallen vrykul. Let the banners serve as a constant reminder to them that they face a more immediate threat than the wrath of the Lich King. 
The Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist wants you to transport 3 Sacks of Relics from the bottom of the site and take them to the platform on the north or south side of Steel Gate. Use the grappling hook on the flying machine to do this. Report back to him after you've done so.	I've Got a Flying Machine!	Well, what are you waiting for, there's work to be done! Here's the keys to our flying machine. Grab three sacks of relics and haul them up to the crane platforms on the north and south sides of Steel Gate. I'll mark them for you. Hurry up! We haven't got all day! 
Kill 15 Dreadsabers and return to Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp.	Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator	If you've hunted with Hemet before, you know that he's tested his skill against many large cats, but the dreadsabers here in Sholazar are different. They're able to bring down larger game than I've ever seen a cat hunt. To overcome and kill such a predator is the mark of a true hunter. If you seek to prove you're up to the challenge, test yourself against the dreadsabers. They live in the wilderness surrounding the camp and south of the river. 
Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.	The Iron Thane and His Anvil	Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside Dun Argol to take control of it. Our information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm. That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called The Anvil. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear. The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level. 
Take the Bundle of Hides to Krenna in Conquest Hold.	Delivery to Krenna	This is it, mon. Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test. Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything. 
Locate Iggy ""Tailspin"" Cogtoggle in the Geyser Fields.	Finding Pilot Tailspin	I should've flown the mission myself. It's not that I don't trust Tailspin. Far from it. Heck, he was the best wingman I ever flew with. No, it's just that it's my responsibility to lead a mission of such import. I sent Tailspin out with our fastest recon squadron to gather information about the Nerubian infestation in the middle of the Geyser Fields. The last report we received placed his squadron in the pools to the far south and just west of the Nerubian sinkholes. Find Tailspin, George. 
Using the secret Frenzyheart drink, slaughter 30 of the Sparktouched Gorlocs around Kartak's Hold.	Secret Strength of the Frenzyheart	Battle still going at Kartak hold... I think it time for you to learn big secret of Frenzyheart. We have berries we keep from other lands we came from... they not so special on their own, but mix them with drunk drinks and they make Frenzyheart super strong. You a Frenzyheart now... it time you get to be strong too. I give some drink, then you be super strong and you go smash all the spark big-tongues. 
Wait for Inquisitor Hallard to finish his Righteous Sermon and return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight with the information you uncover.	A Righteous Sermon	Godfrey Goodard, once a righteous man and mayor of Wintergarde, is now an agent of the Scourge. His transformation from man to undying ghoul has taken place slowly, over time. He hears the call of the Lich King now and lives only to serve his master. But as with all Scourge, Godfrey knows the language of death and with proper motivation, will tell us what we need to know about the tome. Once you hear what you need to hear, return to the High Commander at the front lines. I'll clean up here as needed. 
Find Silas' Secret Stash.	Silas' Secret Stash	A great Darkmoon prize do you now seek, but be ye warned, it is not for the meek. Your very first clue to send you on this caper, you will find printed on the back of this paper. 
Stand by Malfurion as he resurrects Malorne.	The Sanctuary Must Not Fall	Malfurion is working on a miracle for us. He believes that, in this time of peril, he can resurrect Malorne to protect the Sanctuary. I have faith in him. In the meantime, we need to hold this perimeter. Stand by, and make sure no harm befalls my fellow arch druid. 
Plant the Acorn in the Un'Goro Soil at Malfurion's Breach.	Planting Season	The acorn seems to be unharmed.<Avrilla shrugs.>No point in beating around the bush. Let's plant it and see what comes out. Luckily for you, we brought some leftover soil with us to help establish our base. You'll find the soil at the graveyard directly east. 
Find Pebble within the Crumbling Depths and lead him safely out of the tunnels.	Lost In The Deeps	Pebble has gotten himself lost again, somewhere deep in the Crumbling Depths. He's fortunate that his size makes him unworthy of the effort for those gyreworms, but it's only a matter of time before he stumbles too close to one and gets eaten. Whatever he's so intent on down there is certainly not worth it. He seems to like you. Please, go and find him and bring him out of those tunnels to safer playing grounds. 
Assist Goldrinn, Tortolla, Aviana, and Aessina in Mount Hyjal.	Guardians of Hyjal: Call of the Ancients	The Guardians of Hyjal, led by Arch Druid Malfurion Stormrage, seek brave heroes to assist in defending Mount Hyjal from elemental invaders. These invaders must be repelled before forces can mobilize for a direct assault on the Firelands. Willing and able-bodied heroes should report immediately to Mount Hyjal and assist the ancient defenders: Goldrinn, Tortolla, Aviana, and Aessina. New travelers to Mount Hyjal may look for a Hero's Call to Hyjal on any Alliance board. 
Search for clues at the Storm's Fury Wreckage in Deepholm.	Gunship Down	The Archstone was being transported inside a flying Horde gunship called the Storm's Fury. The airship crashed south of here and our scrying has revealed the Archstone's no longer on it. Search the ship for clues related to what might've happened. 
Bring Anren Shadowseeker to the entrance of the Molten Front.	Need... Water... Badly...	Need... water... badly... 
Kill Leyara.	Into the Depths	Leyara has been spotted in the Igneous Depths. A group of Shadow Wardens has cornered her. Go there immediately. I will join you as soon as I make one necessary preparation. 
Obtain 20 Marks of the World Tree.	Calling for Reinforcements	We suffered heavy losses during the backdraft after our invasion attempt. Our second attempt cannot fail. We need reinforcements before we attempt another invasion. Please, George, work with Matoclaw to obtain enough resources to afford reinforcements. Then, we take our second and final stab at the Firelands. 
Obtain 150 Marks of the World Tree.	Druids of the Talon	Skylord Omnuron and his Druids of the Talon have been a fearsome force for us back in Hyjal. I know that they prefer the familiar skies of that battlefield, but the time may come when we need them here nonetheless. If you get your hands on enough marks, you should appeal to Omnuron that his druids should be on the main front. Omnuron watches out for his own, but he also understands the importance of this effort. 
Report to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal.	Guardians of Hyjal: Firelands Invasion!	Your work has given us the advantage we need to mobilize against the denizens of the Firelands. We are gathering our invasion force just south of our position. We could use your strength again, Human. Speak with Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. She is coordinating the invasion effort. 
Obtain a Trogg Crate and use it to submerge yourself and eavesdrop on the Twilight's Hammer camp to the east.	Quicksilver Submersion	The troggs in Deepholm have proven to be every bit as hostile as the ones in Azeroth. Yet perhaps their presence will prove useful to our efforts. The crates they use for trawling through the mercury will conceal you perfectly if you submerge yourself beneath the marsh. Use it to approach the Twilight's Hammer camp in the eastern end of the Upper Silvermarsh undetected. 
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.	Filling the Moonwell	We've constructed this moonwell, but it serves little purpose until it is filled with the sacred waters of the Well of Eternity. With an active moonwell, we would be able to bless our food stores, and we may also be able to use the blessing to offer you some protection from fire as well. When you've obtained enough marks, speak to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. She'll be able to secure transport of the sacred waters. 
Go through the Portal to the Maelstrom and speak to Thrall.	The Maelstrom	Thank the spirits you're here, George. We're not sure how much longer we can maintain the rift in the Maelstrom. Our most powerful members, led by Thrall, are barely preventing the tear. Last I heard, our only hope was to go through the breach and attempt to stabilize it from the other side. I will conjure a portal. Take it and report to Thrall as soon as you can. 
Escort a Windcaller through the Furnace and secure the entrance to the Molten Flow.	Into the Fire	Skylord Omnuron and his druids are seeking to push through the Furnace to our northwest. They've been able to fly over the dangers, but they really need someone on the ground to help them secure the territory past the fire... someone like you. If you want to aid the Druids of the Talon, wait for one of Omnuron's Windcallers to start pushing through the fire, stay close to him, and keep him safe from any attackers within the flames. 
Run through the Darkmoon Races Start Banner, hit the Blue Post, then return to the Darkmoon Races Start Banner.	Welcome to the Darkmoon Races	So this is your first race, eh? Don't worry - it's easier than it looks. Let me break it down for you...Run through that big banner there. That starts everything. Then, follow the smaller banners until you see a big, blue Post. Hit that, then return here. You're scored on your time, so finish as fast as you can! And watch out for those electrified tripwires. They'll slow you down if you run through them. Good luck! 
Obtain the Twilight Slaver's Key and free 6 Enslaved Miners.	Question the Slaves	According to the orders you found, there is a key inside the tent in the southeastern end of Deathwing's Fall. Obtain it and free the slaves in the quarry to the south. 
Run through the Start Banner, hit the Purple Post, then the Green Post, then the Red Post, then the return to the Start Banner.	The Real Big Race	Here's the big one! Good luck out there! This race has four legs: get to the purple post, then green, then red, then back here. Your time matters, so do it fast! 
Report to Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem at Nordune Ridge in Mount Hyjal.	Opening the Door	You're a bit late. Hamuul, Malfurion, and some of our esteemed guests have already traveled to the invasion point, atop that cliff. Our gate to the Firelands is not yet completed, but it will be shortly. The sooner we can break through, the better. Go on! Hamuul will be expecting you. 
Speak to Earthmender Norsala, then kill Fungalmancer Glop.	Glop, Son of Glop	Glop had a son. In his grave hubris, he named it Glop. And so the line of fungalmancers continues. I require you to slay this new fungalmancer. Your shaman ally has already returned, and awaits you at his cave in the southwest of Verlok Stand. 
Obtain 150 Marks of the World Tree.	The Shadow Wardens	The Shadow Wardens are back in the Regrowth. I know that they take the loss of Fandral from their custody very seriously, so it wouldn't take much prodding to bring them to the Firelands to hunt the Druids of the Flame, and perhaps aid us otherwise in the process. Should you come upon enough marks, you should seek out Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the Sanctuary of Malorne and secure her aid. 
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.	Calling the Ancients	The ancients await in Hyjal. The Firelands will prove a dangerous place for them considering their... composition, but their strength will be of great use to us if we are to face any of Ragnaros' lieutenants. Gather your marks, and seek out Elderlimb at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If they are to march with us, he would be the one leading them through the portal. 
Speak with Cyclonas on the Bluff of the South Wind in Uldum.	Into Slashing Winds	Mechanic, I refuse to believe my Go'el is lost forever. His spirit has been scattered across the elemental planes. If even a part of him still exists, we can find him, but I will need your help. We will start with the plane of air. Speak to me and we will travel to the Vortex Pinnacle together. We must speak with an elemental, Cyclonas. He's capricious, but he sees everything in the realm of air. If my love is there, Cyclonas will know what's become of him. 
Speak with Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar.	Warchief's Command: Deepholm!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar. The Earthen Ring, lead by our former Warchief, Thrall, requires our aid! They report that the elemental plane of Deepholm threatens to overtake our world! The Western Earthshrine can be found just north of the Valley of Wisdom. Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls! 
Use the Trained Fire Hawk to kill 100 of the Flamewaker Salamanders, 40 of the Cinderweb Spiders, and 3 of the Molten Lords that are amassing in the Firelands.	Fire in the Skies	Look at that! It's incredible! Born less than two days ago and already full grown. Sadly, I suspect their life cycle is similarly short, so we'll have to take advantage of any time we have. His training went remarkably well. I want you to be the one to take him out and unleash him on the bulk of the enemy forces gathered near Ragnaros' keep. Show no mercy, Human. 
Bring the Smoke-Stained Locket to Malfurion in the Molten Front.	The Rest is History	In her memories, Leyara spoke of Malfurion. The tragedies of her past - at least, in her opinion - are largely due to his actions. Malfurion must remember Leyara from before she became a Druid of the Flame. You resolve to bring the locket to him in the Firelands. Hopefully he can answer any remaining questions. 
Rescue 3 Injured Sailors.	None Left Behind	Your friend has been doing everything she can to save my crew. I'm deeply appreciative. We're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads. I still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help? 
Run through the Start Banner, hit the Blue Post, then the Green Post, then the Red Post, then return to the Start Banner.	The Real Race	Ok, Darkmoon Racer, let's see what you got! The real race has four legs: get to the blue post, then green, then red, then back here. Your time matters, so do it fast! 
Read the Earthen Ring Proclamation to Boden the Imposing.	Imposing Confrontation	Have ya seen the looming giant in the distance to the northeast? Dat is Boden the Imposing, one of Therazane the Stonemother's Stone Lords. We be knowin' little of da Stone Lords, but Boden is not known ta be very level-headed. Sadly, he seems to be da one leadin' dis assault, so he's the one we must be confrontin'. Take dis proclamation to him and read it aloud on behalf of da Earthen Ring. I know it be a bit of a stretch to think words will settle dis, but we have to try. Be cautious. 
Bring First Mate Moody a Bottle of Whiskey and a Spool of Rope.	Without a Captain or Crew	Not sure who you're with, but you don't look like one of... them. I'm not sure what happened. I slept through supper and woke up to a ship full of dead people and murderers. Not sure if you want to kill me or not, but I'll spare you the trouble.<Moody points to a wound in his stomach. His insides are not where they should be.>I can keep steering the ship for a while longer. You don't die from a gut wound immediately. Just bring me some rope and some rum... no, whiskey. 
Slay 6 Fiery Behemoths or Seething Pyrelords.	The Protectors of Hyjal	We need to place pressure on the assault camp at Sethria's Roost. Ragnaros' minions are using this area as a point to push their battlefront beyond the bounds of Hyjal. I'm putting you in charge of a small squad to deal with them. I have selected an elite group of fighters to assist you. Travel to Sethria's Roost. Your compatriots have been instructed to meet you once you arrive. Then put an end to the elementals' assault. 
Speak with Cyclonas to secure passage to Thrall. Then, fight the wind elementals that torment him until he is freed.	Elemental Bonds: Doubt	I do know the one you seek... but I do not know if it is wise for you to follow him. He has cast himself into the cyclone. The winds now tear at his body and mind, leaving nothing but shreds of flesh and doubt. Chasing after him would only expose you to the same fate. The wind's edge leaves nothing uncut. You have been warned. Now what will you do? 
Pass through the portal atop Nordune Ridge and help Malfurion secure a foothold on the Molten Front.	Through the Gates of Hell	There will be time to mourn for Hamuul later. His is the first of many inevitable casualties in this war.... but our attack cannot wait, nor should the momentum we have gained over the last several days be wasted. The portal atop Nordune Ridge is now open. Our reinforcements are prepared, and they await only my order to pass through the portal. We will meet again on the other side of the portal. Once there, we shall ensure that our foothold is secure. 
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.	Additional Armaments	These druids be lackin' the tools ta properly handle the job out 'ere. I got meself a buddy back at day ol' stag shrine through the portal though. If we were ta be gettin' reunited, we'd sure have some real toys ta use against ol' Ragboy and 'is cronies. Take some of dem mark things an' go find Matoclaw. Ask her fer Ricket. We need'r here so we can be causin' some real trouble. 
Fight the waves of Charred Invaders on Nordune Ridge until the portal is opened.	A Ritual of Flame	We appear to have everything under control. Our invasion portal to the Firelands will be opened momentarily, and the elementals have not put up much fight. Assist our druids by dispatching the last few of these elementals. Then, once the gate has been opened, we can make our move. 
Bring the Crimson Lasher to Avrilla.	Little Lasher	The little red flower wiggles its tendrils happily. It seems to like you! Perhaps Avrilla would like to see what grew out of the acorn. 
Kill the Lieutenant of Flame.	Strike at the Heart	One of Ragnaros' Lieutenants has shown himself at Ragnaros' Reach, the walled area to our northeast. I hoped to send you as soon as you returned, but I suspect Witherbranch and some of our forces have already joined the fight by now. You should hurry. You should be able to drop down the cliff wall right here and reach them quickly. 
Coax Shu, the spirit of water, into a game.	Shu, the Spirit of Water	Shu, the spirit of water, is sulking in the deep pool to the north. Cross the rocks and then drop the sun pearl in the center of the pool. He will know what this means. 
Catch three Spirits of Malorne by walking close to them.	Between the Trees	Spirit fragments of Malorne - seen to us mortals as ghostly white deer - still frolic through these forests. While Malorne is no longer with us, these pieces of his spirit may be of use to us. Travel east and walk among the trees. If you are able to get close enough to one of the spirit fragments, it will bestow its power to you. Oh, and take this staff. You may need it later. 
Find Earthcaller Torunscar just northwest of the Temple of Earth, in the Jagged Wastes.	The Very Earth Beneath Our Feet	Only one piece of the World Pillar remains, and it is in the hands of the Stonemother herself. Worse, the temple has come under siege by elementals and giants. It's not a terrible leap of logic to assume they're acting by her will. Go out and meet the elementals in battle to the northwest. Work with Torunscar and Norsala to find a way to communicate with their leaders and seek out the World Pillar. We would prefer such be done peacefully, but we will do whatever we must to seal the rift. 
Bring Pebble to the large crystal formation in the Shuddering Spires.	Clingy	<A miniscule elemental seems to have taken a liking to you.>Caris... carstr... crystal? <Pebble looks up at you expectantly.><You did notice a very large crystal formation towards the middle of the Shuddering Spires. Perhaps you should take him there?> 
Find your way to the Igneous Depths, then destroy all 8 of the blue runes within.	Enduring the Heat	Shalis has gone with one of our druids to stop a Druid of the Flame that is performing a summoning ritual in the Igneous Depths, below us. They have been tasked with killing the druid, but I need you to stop the ritual. You'll find the entrance to the cavern east of the Magma Springs. Once inside, you'll see 8 blue runes spread throughout the cavern. You can use these runes to protect you from the fiery creatures, but you need to stamp all of them out to end the ritual. You will need to be swift. 
Protect one of the druids attempting to take the Forlorn Spire.	The Forlorn Spire	Captain Saynna Stormrunner is launching an attack against the Forlorn Spire. If you head to the northeast, you'll find her at the bottom of the ramp leading up towards that rise. Go there and escort one of her druids to the tower with any forces that she can spare. You'll have quite a fight ahead of you - make sure the druid lives to see the end of it or they'll not be able to seize the tower. 
Complete the One With the Ground ritual.	One With the Ground	The leader of the Stone Mother's forces here is the great earth elemental lord, Avalanchion. Luckily for us, the Twilight's Hammer cultists have decided to invade his lair. They're seeking to bind his elementals to their will. We will take advantage of the chaos. The earth ritual that I invoke will make you one with the ground. It will take you near to Avalanchion without alerting him to your presence. It's up to you to finish him. 
Slay Avalanchion.	Bring Down the Avalanche	Avalanchion stands before you. Slay him to keep Therazane's forces from attacking Stonehearth. 
Speak with Thrall at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal.	Elemental Bonds: The Vow	Before he passed through the portal to Mount Hyjal, Thrall asked you to follow him. There is something he would like you to witness. 
Kill fire elementals next to Aggra's Air Totem, on the western edge of the plateau, until it activates. Then continue to Aggra's Water Totem, Aggra's Earth Totem, and Aggra's Fire Totem.	Elemental Bonds: Fury	The totems, George! We need to activate them, or Go'el is lost! Kill the elementals next to each of my totems, located around the edges of this plateau. Once all four totems are activated, we should be able to free the last piece of Go'el's soul! 
Kill High Priestess Lorthuna.	The Binding	A noise in the main chamber of the temple draws your attention. You hear a familiar laugh... Lorthuna. She's returned to interrupt the ritual - you must stop her! 
Speak to Ricket at Malfurion's Breach.	Well Armed	Ricket should be at Malfurion's Breach with Damek, as you requested. I'm not sure you fully know what you're getting into with those two though. Speaking of which, you should probably go check on them... make sure they haven't managed to blow up the Sentinel Tree itself. As long as you keep them busy with the elementals, the chances of ""accidents"" at the breach should lessen dramatically. 
Bring the Smoke-Stained Locket to Rabine Saturna at Nighthaven in Moonglade.	A Smoke-Stained Locket	This locket has a few small leaf-shaped carvings etched into its face, but any other details have been rubbed away with time, or burned away with fire. It appears to be druidic in nature. Most druids pass through Moonglade during their training. If anybody can help you decipher where this locket came from, it would be Rabine Saturna of Nighthaven. 
Speak to Dafeng, the spirit of air, in the Chamber of Whispers.	Dafeng, the Spirit of Air	If you listen long enough, the wind will carry the answer to you. Dafeng, the spirit of air, has been scared from the skies by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. He hides within the Chamber of Whispers, at the south side of the plateau. Go to him. Ji and I will join you there. 
Speak to Maruut Stonebinder at the Temple of Earth in Deepholm.	Return to the Temple of Earth	You must get word back to the others at the temple. Chances are, the fragment is already getting moved to a more secure location. Tell Maruut what you know. I'm going to do a little investigating about this Twilight Council in the meantime. 
Obtain a Flame Druid Staff, a Flame Druid Spellbook, a Flame Druid Reagent Pouch, and a Flame Druid Idol.	Fandral's Methods	The Druids of the Flame... an order of druids that, up until a few weeks ago, Tholo and I had never even heard of. Now, under the leadership of Fandral Staghelm, they threaten our mission's success with their mastery of fire. It would appear that they store some supplies in the Igneous Depths, to the northeast. Perhaps, if we can get some of those supplies, we will have more luck when we take the fight to Fandral. 
Obtain 4 Twilight Research Notes from Mercurial Oozes in the Upper Silvermarsh.	Twilight Research	The book you found appears to detail some form of research carried out by a member of the Twilight's Hammer. It deals with the oozes in some way, but there are multiple pages missing. Perhaps if you found additional notes you might be able to make sense of it. 
Deliver the token to the shady character.	A Shady Character	Your followers tell of a smuggler of wit and guile, who was able to charm them with stories of lands far and wide. Though it cost a fair sum to retrieve, they managed to obtain a token which when displayed to the smuggler, will allow the bearer to purchase his wares. 
Place the Earthen Ring Banner in the center of Abyssion's Lair, slay him and obtain the Upper World Pillar Fragment.	The World Pillar Fragment	It is time, George. We have spotted Abyssion making his way to the lair. The Twilight's Hammer might've thought the fragment would be safe if a dragon guarded it, but I've met enough dragons to know their one weakness. Pride. Abyssion's not going to run from a fight with us puny mortals. Place the banner of the Earthen Ring in the middle of his lair. Once we defeat him, bring the fragment to Maruut. We need to repair the World Pillar as soon as possible. 
Find Initiate Goldmine at the Quartzite Basin in Deepholm.	Where's Goldmine?	My goblin initiate has been gone for quite some time. His name is Goldmine. I sent him out to observe the local rock flayers southwest at the Quartzite Basin. Perhaps you would be willing to find him? When you do, please ask him to come back to the temple. 
Accompany Fearsome Jang and await the masters' announcement.	The Dawning Light	It was a miracle that you were able to survive, George. It is with great sorrow that I have to say that Grand Master Hight was not so lucky. His spirit now rests with the ancestors. Now we must look to a new leader for our order, our broken temple. I have spoken with the other masters and we are all of one mind on this. We all agree that new leader should be you, George. You have shown strength, wisdom, courage, and kindness beyond measure. Walk with us to the temple and we will announce our decision. 
Seek out Therazane at Therazane's Throne.	The Stone Throne	I am returning to my throne. I've no desire to see any more of these Earthen Ring, but you remain welcome here, Human. If you wish to help us rebuild our realm, perhaps we can help you in return. All things in time. 
Rally 5 shaman in the rear of the Temple of Earth, and then speak to Maruut Stonebinder.	Rallying the Earthen Ring	We must be rallyin' da Earthen Ring for dis fight. What we be lackin' in numbers, we make up for in strength. Go to tha temple and gather da restin' shaman from tha rear rooms. Norsala, Lorvarius, and I will be meetin' them at Lorthuna's Gate. 
Run through the Start Banner, hit the Purple Post, then the Green Post, then the Red Post, then the return to the Start Banner.	More Big Racing!	You like this big race, do you? Me too! It has four legs: get to the purple post, then green, then red, then back here. Your time matters, so do it fast! 
Rescue and defend healers until Shen-zin Su's wound is healed.	The Healing of Shen-zin Su	This is more horrific than I imagined, but we can handle this. We need to gather the healers and close the wound. We need to save Shen-zin Su. Find any healers you can! Rescue them, relieve them - whatever you need to do to get them over here healing the wound. Keep the healers safe at all costs! 
Deliver the Catapult Parts to Peak Grindstone on the Fractured Front in Deepholm.	Rush Delivery	Peak Grindstone's team broke down somewhere out there to the west. Think you can make yourself useful for a change and rush some parts out to them, Human? 
Speak to Pebble in the Shuddering Spires. If you stay on the ground long enough, he should come out of hiding to find you.	Pebble	If you hadn't noticed, there's a very small elemental that has taken a liking to you. If you stay on the ground for even a few moments, I'm sure you'll spot him. You seem to be quite adept at making friends down here. A good talent to have. 
Activate a Mechashark X-Steam Controller and use the Mechashark X-Steam to slay The Hammer.	A Goblin in Shark's Clothing	Combining the remains of the Mechachicken with these shark parts, we've assembled the greatest fighting submersible of all time: the Mechashark X-Steam! Hobart and I want you to pilot it, George. Go west to the water and activate the Mechashark X-Steam Controller. You must kill The Hammer if we're to have any hope of exploiting the natural resources of the Dire Strait to their fullest extent. It's for the good of the cartel! 
Investigate the central area in the back of the Masters' Gate.	Fly Over	I tried ta fly o'er the terrace an have a look fer myself, but those toastie eatin' pansies kept shootin' at me, an I couldn't get near. Ya look like ya might be handy with the reins. Why don' ya take yer flyin' beastie up there ta the southwest and see what all the fuss is about? 
Speak with Naraat the Earthspeaker at the Eastern Earthshrine in Stormwind City.	Hero's Call: Deepholm!	By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Naraat the Earthspeaker at the Eastern Earthshrine in Stormwind City. The Earthen Ring requires our aid! They report that the elemental plane of Deepholm threatens to overtake our world and destroy all life on Azeroth! The Eastern Earthshrine can be found directly northwest of Stormwind Keep. For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>! 
Recover 5 Fire Hawk Hatchlings.	Starting Young	Our scouts are bringing back reports of fire hawk hatchlings all over the peak... their eggs must have hatched very recently. Better yet, it seems that they're extremely docile. I know it may sound a strange and perhaps unsavory request, but if you were able to bring some of those hatchlings back to me, I might be able to train them to aid us in our war efforts. Are you willing? 
Jump on Aggra's Wyvern and fly into the breach at the Maelstrom. Once you're on the other side, speak to Maruut Stonebinder.	Deepholm, Realm of Earth	I knew you'd heed our call, George. When Deathwing was first defeated by the other dragon aspects, he retreated to Deepholm, the realm of earth. Deathwing's return to our world left a rift open between Azeroth and Deepholm. If we don't mend the breach, this land will be torn asunder. We're doing our best to contain the damage on this side of the rift. Aggra will take you through the rift so you can help repair the damage from the other side. Get on her wyvern when you're ready. 
Meet with Ji Firepaw in Morning Breeze Village.	Morning Breeze Village	The fourth and final spirit is Dafeng, the spirit of air. When he is not in the skies, he can be found on the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the west. I've sent both Aysa and Ji to help you find him. When you are ready, I will summon winds to carry you to the top of the temple. From there, cross the bridges to the west and find Ji in Morning Breeze Village. 
Take the Acorn to Avrilla at Malfurion's Breach in the Firelands.	The Mysterious Seed	A small, dried acorn has fallen out of the Flame Druid's robe. Why would a Druid of the Flame be carrying it around? Perhaps someone at Malfurion's Breach would like to see it. 
Win a Tol Barad battle and return to Colonel Karzag at Hellscream's Grasp in Tol Barad Peninsula.	Victory in Tol Barad	Maintaining control of Tol Barad is the key to our strategic plans here in the Eastern Kingdoms, Human. We must do whatever it takes to keep the Alliance off this island and that means we need your help. Fight with everything you have to win control of Tol Barad and bring me word of victory. 
Speak with Explorer Mowi at the Temple of Earth in Deepholm.	The Explorers	We have a contingent of the Explorers' League in the chamber just to the northwest inside the temple. They've been making increasing noises about something that the Twilight's Hammer is up to. George, would you be a dear and see what they need? 
Find Leyara, the Druid of the Flame.	Leyara	Before we depart, George, I have another matter to which you should attend. A Druid of the Flame has been spotted in the ruins to the northwest. I suspect it is the same one that attacked us at the portal several days ago. Now would be an ideal time to see what it is that she truly wants... and if necessary, dispose of her. See to this flame druid, then we can continue on our planned course. 
Open the gates to Pei-Wu Forest.	Bidden to Greatness	It is up to all of you to remove the thorn from the side of Shen-zin Su. Do not let your differences come between you. Trust in each other. Within the Pei-Wu Forest is a lone hermit. Head directly to his hut. He knows intimately of the dark things that now lurk in the trees. 
Speak with Thrall at the Gallywix Docks on the Lost Isles.	Victory!	We just can't thank you enough for all that you've done. Now we can all get off of this island before it kills us! Thrall is going to want to speak with you first, George. I'll rocket you over there. See you on the ship! 
Meet Stormcaller Mylra aboard the Alliance Gunship.	Diplomacy First	The Earthen Ring is a neutral organization, George. We cannot pick sides in the war between the Horde and the Alliance. Look around you -- our members come from all backgrounds. Our mission would be compromised should racial tensions be put above our goal. Let's try to keep this under wraps until we have more information. We must not jump to conclusions just yet. I'll send you and one of our new members to look for the Alliance gunship. Find out what you can without dragging us into the conflict. 
Speak with Thrall just south of the World Tree in Mount Hyjal.	The Call of the World-Shaman	The Earthen Ring calls to you once more, George. As a member of the Alliance, I know that you may have reservations working with the one you call Thrall, the former Warchief of the Horde. But he has specifically requested an Alliance hero to accompany him in his next endeavor, a ritual of healing that will profoundly impact our world. Cast aside your doubts, Mechanic, and heed the world-shaman's call. You will find him under the boughs of Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal, on the southern side of the tree. 
Find the Subterranean Magma Worm's breath bubbles, then defeat it by making it swallow the Bitter Pill.	A Bitter Pill	As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem that can't be solved with bombs. And if a bomb doesn't solve your problem on the first try... use a bigger bomb. So there's this big worm that's been eating people near the lava pools up north. Search for breath bubbles to find it. Attack it until it prepares to bite, then place this bomb down in front of it. Then sit back and watch the fireworks. Hmm... there was one other thing I wanted to say... oh yeah! Don't get eaten. 
Bring the Jade Tiger Pillar to Jojo Ironbrow in Morning Breeze Village.	Stronger Than Bone	This giant jade tiger pillar doesn't seem to fit in amidst the hozen buildings. What it does seem is very hard. Very solid. You know just the person to bring this to. 
Speak to Therazane, the Stonemother.	At the Stonemother's Call	It is time. The Stonemother will speak with you. You can find her throne in northern Deepholm, above the Scoured Reach. 
Help Elderlimb, Thisalee Crow, Tholo Whitehoof and Anren Shadowseeker escape the flames.	Caught Unawares	Our invasion plan looks to have backfired. Several of our birds have already reported in, speaking of fires breaking out across the vales of central Hyjal. Now, many of our druids are stranded out in the field, unprepared for such a large-scale attack. Thisalee was near Ashen Lake, and several others were out in the Regrowth, to the northeast. Go, George! Find them, and make sure that they do not succumb to this backdraft! 
Slay Maziel inside the Silverlight Cave in Deepholm.	Maziel's Ascendancy	Maziel's journal chronicles a ritual of ascendancy that would transfigure his body to one of pure quicksilver. The ritual would take place in the cave near the Lower Silvermarsh, where Maziel would feed upon the mercurial oozes until achieving full strength. Perhaps it is not too late to put an end to his madness. 
Introduce Flint Oremantle to Earthcaller Yevaa at the Temple of Earth.	Take Him to the Earthcaller	He still looks a little loopy to me. His head must still be ringing. Best get him inside the temple and see what the Earthcaller wants to do with him. I think I'm going to stay out here a little while longer and ""observe"" these rock flayers. 
Use the Fang of the Wolf atop the corpses of 10 Firelands invaders within the Regrowth.	Perfecting Your Howl	The wolf ancient, Lo'gosh - or, if you prefer, Goldrinn - has many weapons available to him, but always the most underestimated is his howl. Today, we will use this weapon to summon and defeat Lylagar, one of the lieutenants of flame that lurk within the Firelands. Defeat any of the creatures of flame within the Regrowth, and then use the Fang of the Wolf while standing atop their corpse. Soon, your howl will echo across all of Kalimdor. 
Recover the Middle Fragment of the World Pillar.	The Middle Fragment	I present you with the key to Stonehearth. With it you may unlock the vault to my home and recover the middle fragment of the World Pillar. Keep the fragment safe, George. Make certain to get it to the Temple of Earth in the middle of Deepholm as quickly as possible! Know that you are always welcome here. 
Get into the Ultimate Footbomb Uniform and then deal with Trade Prince Gallywix.	Final Confrontation	George, this is it! Thrall's down at the Gallywix Docks fighting the Trade Prince right now! You gotta jump into your Ultimate Footbomb Uniform and get over there! 
Kill Dragul Giantbutcher and 12 Twilight Cultists at Lorthuna's Gate.	Hatred Runs Deep	I would apologize for Boden, but stone is stubborn. It does not sway from its ways without the wear of time. The Stone Lords, Boden and I among them, are charged with retrieving the World Pillar. In that, we are at odds. I would extend my patience upon you, Human. Prove that you are no ally of the Twilight Cult or Deathwing...Carry our hatred upon them. Strike swiftly where we cannot. Succeed and I will listen. 
Defeat Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent with the aid of Ji's fireworks.	Battle for the Skies	Dafeng, the spirit of air, is terrified by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. We must help him face that fear, or face it for him ourselves. When I told Ji of the serpent, he said he had an idea and would begin preparations outside of the chamber. Despite his rash nature, I must admit, I envy his passion and conviction. Let us go outside and confront the Onyx Serpent. 
Speak with Crag Rockcrusher at Stonehearth in Deepholm.	To Stonehearth's Aid	The earthen and the stone troggs somehow found their way to Deepholm through Uldum more than fifteen thousand years ago. They've been warring ever since. If we're to recover the middle fragment of the World Pillar, the Stonefather must be rescued. Please go to Stonehearth and do everything that you can to aid the Earthen in their war against the stone troggs. You're our best hope, George. 
Defeat Boldrich Stonerender and High Priestess Lorthuna.	Therazane's Mercy	There are two leaders among the Twilight that need to be killed. One is a human by the name of Boldrich. Small, as you are. But still dangerous, as you also are. The other is a priestess by the name of Lorthuna. She is wily and hard to corner. Strike swiftly and do not let her escape, or I promise you, you will regret it later. 
Kill 6 Stone Drakes.	Hard Falls	Stone Dragons bow only to strength. When we have punished them enough, they will bend back to our will. I have sent many of my strongest giants onto the fields in the west. They will bring the drakes to the ground. You will see to it that they do not take wing again after they fall. 
Relieve Tawn Winterbluff, Stormcaller Mylra, and Hargoth Dimblaze by helping them to defeat their opponents.	Crumbling Defenses	When da attack started, we pushed out to take da field as quickly as we could. Dere forces were deep and endless... we underestimated dem. Now some of our best shaman be stranded out dere, exhausted, far from our defenses. Make your way out and take da pressure off of our stranded brothas. Even a small break in battle be a chance to get much needed room ta breathe. Be swift, Mechanic. 
Collect the Masters' Gate Plans.	The Twilight Plot	We came here to investigate rumors of a Titan artifact up at the Masters' Gate to the southwest. One of those Twilight's Hammer cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there. You're going to have to get them for us, George. Kill cultists at the Masters' Gate until you find them. 
Defeat Aeosera.	The Restless Brood	Aeosera is restless and stubborn. She scoffs at our dominance, and she needs to be reminded of her place. I still have the mallet you retrieved for me. Return to the western edge of the Pale Roost and strike the resonating crystal. I will meet you there and lend what aid I can. Put her back in her place, Mechanic. 
Subdue Mor'norokk the Hateful at the Alliance Gunship in Deepholm.	On Second Thought, Take One Prisoner	It's not too late, George. The cultists are probably still here. Go below decks, find out who's in charge and subdue them. We will obtain answers to our questions, one way or another. 
	End Time Reward Quest	 
Slay 5 Sundered Emerald Colossi.	The Axe of Earthly Sundering	The emerald colossi are the greatest of the Stone Mother's creatures. They must be the first to be removed from the field. I brought Stonefather Oremantle's axe for just this task. Use it to sunder the giants. That should bring them down to a more manageable size for you to finish off. 
Gather 6 Jade Crystal Clusters, combine them, and shatter them within the Lorthuna's Gate encampment.	Unsolid Ground	The Twilight Cult are mining jade crystals near their camp. Foolish...Reckless...Gather the mined crystals. Take them to the center of their camp. Shatter them against the ground. The reverberations and the powered crystal will bring the tunnelers upon them. They will learn respect for the earth...Piece by piece...Rock by rock......with time. 
Speak to the Spirit of Master Shang Xi, and choose whether you leave with the Alliance or the Horde.	A New Fate	These new allies have shed light on a great and important truth: it is not just Shen-zin Su that is ailing, but all of the land beyond the clouds. The world needs healing, and I think that you should be the ones to heal it. I would like you, Ji, and Aysa to leave and bring your strength and wisdom to the world. These Alliance and Horde have different ideals, but at the core of both lies noble intent. I will leave the choice of who you wish to accompany to you. 
Obtain a Dragon Snare from the Twilight Dragonstalkers.	To Catch a Dragon	Having a dragon guard the fragment was a smart move on the enemy's part. They can keep moving its location any time we get close to it. Catching Abyssion will be extremely difficult, but I have a plan that might help. The Twilight's Hammer uses magical traps to bind stone drakes to the ground while they drain their energy. If we can get our hands on one of these, we might be able to ground the Twilight Dragon for just long enough. Go east of here, to the Alabaster Shelf, and obtain a trap. 
Speak to Stormcaller Mylra at the Twilight Overlook in Deepholm.	The Twilight Overlook	The dragon they're speaking of is Abyssion, George. It's not going to be easy to get the fragment off of him. Meet with Mylra again. She is operating nearby at the Twilight Overlook. She will tell you what our next move will be. 
Rescue 5 Injured Druids of the Talon on Fireplume Peak.	Singed Wings	Many of our Storm Crows have gone ahead to scout the peak and attempt to retrieve some of the fire hawk eggs, but to very little success I'm afraid. The thermals make it nearly impossible to fly safely, and the fire hawks aren't exactly friendly either. I need you to head over there and rescue any druids that you can. I've got splints, bandages, burn salves, smelling salts... anything you'll need to get them back on their feet, assuming they're still alive. Please hurry and help anyone you can find. 
Use the Quill of the Bird-Queen to summon and defeat Millagazor.	Wings Aflame	<Matoclaw's voice continues to echo within your head.>Millagazor is a creature of flame, but in many ways, he is not unlike the birds of this land. As such, Aviana's artifacts may still have the power to summon him. The fiery portal to the west is where you will find him. Use the quill near the portal's entrance, then prepare for a fierce battle. 
Bring Lorvarius' wind-devil to the clouds of red mist in the Crimson Expanse, near the water, and then return with a sample.	A Head Full of Wind	I'm no druid, but some of these mushrooms do not look to be naturally occurring. I know that our Stone Lord friend over there is eager to blame this on exposure to Azeroth, but I suspect more domestic causes. I saw some clouds of red mist to the northeast, near the water's edge. They seemed to be spurring new growth in their wake. Take one of my wind-devils with you and get me a sample from those clouds. You may have to stay close to the ground to spot them. 
Rush at least 5 Opalescent Guardians east by ground, out of the Pale Roost, to the stone circle near Therazane's Throne.	Don't. Stop. Moving.	When Deathwing came, the Stone Dragons flocked to him. In his absence, they are again without purpose. They swarm and feed upon our kin. I have bound dozens of Opalescent Guardians, but am unable to lead them from the safety of cover. I need someone more swift, as I suspect you might be. Lead them by ground towards Therazane's Throne to the east. Surely, some will not make it, but as long as you keep moving, you should be able to bring several to join our forces there. 
Rip the Still-Beating Heart from out of Chip Endale's chest.	The Fastest Way to His Heart	Oh, girl! You're never going to guess who's out on the oil platform to the north.<Izzy shakes her head sadly at you.>Chip's out there, and he's working for the Trade Prince. That cold-hearted snake dropped you like a bad habit and now he's working for the other team. I even heard he's going out with that tramp, Candy Cane! I don't know about you, but if he was my ex, I'd rip his still-beating heart out of his chest. 
Attack a Druid of the Flame to weaken it, then lure it into your Shadow Warden's trap.	The Wardens are Watching	We must tread carefully, Mechanic. Fandral's Druids of the Flame practice their fiery magic beyond the pillars to the north. I need you to capture one of those druids alive for questioning. We must seize every opportunity to learn of their plans. One of my wardens will accompany you. Follow her instructions if you wish to survive. 
Retrieve and equip a Trainee's Mace and a Trainee's Book of Prayers.	The Lesson of the Iron Bough	First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve a mace and a book of prayers from one of the weapon racks below, bring them to me, and show me that you know how to hold them properly. 
Use the Emerald of Aessina to summon and kill Pyrachnis.	Nature's Blessing	<Mylune's voice rings in your head, like the sound of birds chirping.>I love all creatures of the forest, even spiders, despite the fact that they are icky. But the spiders from the Firelands are worse than icky. They're burny, and don't belong here. Find the fire portal in the western Regrowth, and use the gem I gave you earlier to force it open. When a fire spider emerges, step on it! Unless it's big. Then, do something Mechanicy to it. Oh, and use the gem if spider venom makes you woozy! 
Deal with the leader of the Naga at the Ruins of Vashj'elan.	Surrender or Else!	George, you and Ace need to march those naga hatchlings down there and use them as leverage to convince the leader of the naga to surrender to us. Ace knows where to go on the south side of the ruins... just follow him. 
Destroy 8 Energized Geodes or Lodestone Elementals near the Depleted Totem.	Elemental Energy	It's taking every ounce of our power to keep this realm stable in the absence of the World Pillar. As shaman we can tap directly into the energies of the elementals that inhabit Deepholm and use them to heal the damage that the rift is causing. Take this totem and place it on the ground outside. Any energized geodes or lodestone elementals destroyed in its proximity will fill it with the energy we require. 
Climb up trees in the Whistling Grove, grab stranded Hyjal Bear Cubs, and then hurl them at the Soft Target from the top of the tree. This is perfectly safe.	Those Bears Up There	Oh, raspberries! Just when we had saved the last bear cub from the treetops, the fires returned and scared them again! I don't know if you know this, but baby bears are precious and soft. Go to the Whistling Grove, far to the northwest. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and chuck them - gently! - to the soft target in the center of the grove.<Without warning, Mylune suddenly smashes you against her bosom and begins sobbing.>Lil' b-b-b-baby bears! Save them, George! 
Report to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal.	To the Sanctuary!	We should not worry about this ""Druid of the Flame"" for the time being. We must be concerned with the continuance of our operation. Return to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If Ragnaros was prepared for our arrival, then I anticipate that his forces will launch a counterattack soon. 
Protect Aysa while she meditates.	The Way of the Tushui	It's a pleasure to meet you, Mechanic. I am Aysa, of the Tushui. I've spent much time in thought since Master Shang told me we would be searching for Huo, the spirit of fire. I know where he resides, but not how to reach him. The answers are close, however. Come with me to the Cave of Meditation nearby. It is a place of great wisdom. I will meditate there, open my mind, and the path shall find us. 
Drive the Hot Rod around and pickup your friends: Ace, Gobber, and Izzy.	Rolling with my Homies	George, you're about to host the corporate party to end all corporate parties. My research says that if you're seen having a good time at the party, your promotion quotient will skyrocket and explode! So, with that in mind, might I suggest that you take your new company hot rod out for a spin? Go pick up your friends. Just remember me on the way up when it all comes together and you're the new Trade <Prince/Princess>, okay? 
Slay 12 Stone Trogg Ambushers.	We're Surrounded	Our war has been waged for longer than your kind counts time. Let us see if you can make a difference, Human. The stone troggs are a mistake of the titans. On your world they have succumbed to the Curse of Flesh. But here, in Deepholm, you see them in their true form. We're surrounded. Maybe you could go out there and break a few troggs down for us. See what they're really made of? 
Kill 3 Molten Behemoths.	The Harder They Fall	Molten Behemoths have joined the elementals upon the battlefield. They are crushing our front lines. I need you to halt their momentum. You'll find the beasts slow and clumsy. They can easily be outmaneuvered, but they will pack a devastating punch if they hit you. Be nimble, Mechanic. 
Camp Coordinator Brack has asked you to kill 8 Shipwrecked Sailors at the Cape of Lost Hope. The cape is located due northwest of here, on the beach.	Rattling Their Cages	We have been having issues with the undead down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now. Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks. Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there? I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point. Keep an eye out for horde, we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately. 
Put on your Awesome Party Ensemble (Cool Shades, Hip New Outfit, and Shiny Bling) and then head over to the party at the KTC Headquarters pool to entertain 10 Kezan Partygoers.	Life of the Party	Oh my gosh, babe! Everyone is here! Who cares about some stupid dragon? We setup the party around the pool. Sounds like they're having a great time. You are going to look so good! Why don't you head over to the pool and keep everyone entertained? I'll join you in a moment... I just have to slip into something even more amazing! 
Attend the Audience with the Stonemother.	Audience with the Stonemother	Stay where you are, champion. I have not yet decided what to do with you or your Earthen Ring. 
Remove the thorn from Shen-zin Su.	Risking It All	Wait, what?! How could he be so reckless? Blowing the ship free is insane! They could kill Shen-zin Su, and all of us with it. I know we don't have much time, but we need to think of another way... 
Collect 12 Thunder Stones.	Thunder Stones	To the north lies the Fractured Front. That is where most of the heavy fighting is happening. Go into Stonehearth proper and grab all of the thunder stones that you can. Our engineers need them for the catapults. When you have enough, take them to Clay Mudaxle. Don't mind his tongue. He's old and cranky, and should have gone back into the earth thousands of years ago. 
Use Mylra's Knife to obtain 5 Sides of Basilisk Meat from dead Jadecrest Basilisks.	Big Game, Big Bait	We're only going to get one shot at capturing Abyssion, George. Let's make it count. We'll test out the trap on the biggest of the stone dragons in the Alabaster Shelf. To lure the stone matriarch, we're going to need to gather sufficient bait. Take this knife and carve 5 sides of basilisk meat. That ought to be enough even for her appetite. 
Destroy 10 of the newly sprouted mushrooms in the Crimson Expanse.	Fungal Fury	Something upon the Crimson Expanse continues to spur disgusting growths upon the rock. New fungi are rising, and they need to be crushed before they can spread. 
Heal 8 Wounded Hyjal Defenders.	Burn Victims	We have warriors out in the field who are falling wounded, and many of our druids are too busy fighting to give them proper aid. I need you to go to the north, towards the Ashen Fields, and tend their wounds at least enough that they can make it back to safety. If you haven't any bandages or healing spells, I had Rayne put together this salve, which should prove sufficient to get them on their feet. 
Use the Spirit Totem on the corpses of 6 Slain Crew Members.	All Our Friends Are Dead	Something's wrong here, George. The ship's crew has been slain. Yet there is no bloodshed or damage to the ship's structure. This was not the Horde's doing. We will find the answers we seek by speaking to the spirits of the dead. They have not yet left this world. Take this totem and place it near the corpses of the fallen. You will have a few seconds to listen to their last few thoughts. Beware, however! There is no telling how the spirits of the dead will react to our prodding. 
Find Diamant the Patient at the northeast edge of the Jagged Wastes.	Rocky Relations	<Norsala reaches to the ground in an attempt to discern Diamant's location, but jumps back in shock after a moment's contact.>My! Dat was unexpected. Diamant ain't far at all. When I reached out ta him, he spoke back wit me and told me where we could be finin' him. Head towards tha northeastern edge of the Jagged Wastes - Diamant will be expectin' ya. George, be careful. It may be unlike an earth bein' to lay an ambush, but it was unlike dem to siege the temple in da first place. 
Speak with Slate Quicksand at the Quaking Fields in Deepholm.	The Quaking Fields	Before you can help us here, you're going have to deal with Therazane, the Stone Mother's, forces to the south. The elementals and giants upon the Quaking Fields are being mustered. They too are after the middle fragment of the World Pillar. They'll attack us amidst our war with the stone troggs and we'll be unable to repel them. I've sent the arch geomancer ahead. Get to Slate Quicksand and do as he asks. 
Bombard 30 Fungal Terrors and/or Stone Trogg Reinforcements.	Keep Them off the Front	Oh good, you brought another catapult with you! Clay might be older than dirt, but he makes a mean war machine. Well, you didn't bring it all the way out here for your health, flesh bag. Get in one of those things and bombard the fungal terrors and reinforcements streaming out of Needlerock Slag. We have to keep them off the front! 
Obtain the Burning Heart.	Something that Burns	Alright, we need something that's going to make the compound go, ""Boom""!I'm all out of gun powder, but I think I know what we can use instead... the heart of my fire elemental! Here, take my fire totem east to the Blood Trail. Just flip the switch on it near any of the lava pools over there and Magmatooth should be summoned. Bring back his heart and we'll be in business. 
Use your Call the Flock ability to gather 12 Alpine Songbirds, 5 Forest Owls, and 2 Goldwing Hawks.	Call the Flock	Today, we have an opportunity to make another assault against one of Ragnaros' greater minions: Millagazor. However, we first need to get some assistance.<Matoclaw holds up a large, silky feather.>Use this artifact to invoke the power of Aviana. Once you have done so, travel northwest and gather some of her flock by calling out to them. Once you have done so, we may proceed against Millagazor. 
Slay 5 Fire Hawks.	Territorial Birds	The fire hawks are upset by our continued presence. They're getting extremely hostile, and not just in the usual territorial ways. I worry that if we leave them unchecked, they will soon be joining the assault on our tree, and I'm not sure we're capable of handling that. Go across the way to Fireplume Peak and do what you have to to keep them in check. I'm far more concerned with our safety right now than theirs, so be decisive about it. 
Recover 10 Motes of Painite.	Motes	Some of the rarest crystals form in the most dangerous places. In the Crumbling Depths, you will find painite formations - much better than the gold that your races cherish so much. As a being of flesh and a being of small stature, you can enter the Crumbling Depths to retrieve motes of painite for me. Would you undergo that danger on my behalf? 
Speak with Tooga to summon and kill Nemesis. Stand under Tooga's shell to protect you from Nemesis' Molten Fury.	Echoes of Nemesis	<Mylune's voice sings like a melody in your head.>Remember that awful fire turtle, Nemesis, from the Firelands? He's dead now (yay!) but echoes of him keep trying to break through to Mount Hyjal. Go to the shores of the Ashen Lake and speak with my friend Tooga. Let him know you're ready to fight an echo of Nemesis, and the turtles will draw him into this world. Then you can hit him! Hard! Hide inside of Tooga's shell if he starts to erupt. 
Use Tholo's Thermometer to measure the temperature of the three large lava pools on Fireplume Peak.	How Hot	The fire hawks of Fireplume Peak can withstand incredible temperatures. While you'll often find them circling the skies above, they're also known to swim in molten lava. Isn't that right, Anren? We'd like to know just how hot that lava can get. Fireplume Peak has three large lava pools. Use this to measure the temperature of each. 
Defeat the Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare.	An Ancient Evil	George, I was looking for you! One of the escaping sailors just spotted Aysa in the wreckage of the ship, facing some enormous beast. She might need your help - you should go to her, quickly! 
Speak to Earthmender Norsala, then kill Fungalmancer Glop.	Wrath of the Fungalmancer	Their leader hides within his hole ahead. He is the one that has brought the plague upon the crimson expanse. He must be killed. One of your Earthen Ring companions is already inside. You should speak with her. 
Interact with and gain a War Guardian, and destroy 5 Giant Mushrooms.	Sprout No More	The stone trogg mystics are creating those fungal monstrosities from the giant mushrooms to the north. I want you to take a war guardian to help deal with the giants and stone troggs. Make your way to the giant mushrooms and target them. I and my geomancers will sink them into the ground before the mystics have a chance to finish their ritual. 
Kill 15 Twilight Precipice Cultists.	The Stone March	My forces have already begun the assault. Join them. Spill the blood of these cultists upon the ground, that I might feel how they suffer. 
Use the Super Booster Rocket Boots to slay 50 Goblin Zombies.	Zombies vs. Super Booster Rocket Boots	Those zombies that got past us are nothing compared to the numbers waiting just through the pass. If we don't deal with them soon, the pygmy witch doctors are going to send all of them against the town, and even the cannons down there won't be able to handle that many! I brought a couple of shredder boots along. Greely modded them and now they're Super Booster Rocket Boots! Use the boots to incinerate the zombies in the Oostan villages to the east. 
Speak to Gorsik the Tumultuous upon the Crimson Expanse.	Rocky Upheaval	To the east, on the Crimson Expanse, you will find Gorsik. He embodies the more unstable and violent nature of our kind. He is neither friendly, nor trusting, but his word carries weight. Proving yourself to Gorsik will go a long way towards proving yourself to the Stonemother. 
Retrieve 8 bags of Verlok Miracle-Grow.	Corruption Destruction	If this disgusting growth is truly brought on by the Verlok, then their supplies will be in their village to the north. Bring them to me so that I can verify your claims. 
Bring the Smoke-Stained Locket to the Small Gravestone at Leyara's Sorrow in Hyjal.	The Tipping Point	On the day when Leyara attacked Hamuul, she was waiting near some ruins in Hyjal, northwest of the Regrowth. She acted strangely at the time: calm, silent, and staring off into the distance. Perhaps that location is of some importance to her. The locket might react if brought to that location. 
Bring the Spirit of Fire to the Temple of Five Dawns.	The Passion of Shen-zin Su	<Huo bounces around excitedly, ready to follow you.><Master Shang Xi told you to bring Huo to meet him at the Temple of Five Dawns in the center of the island. Your next destination lies before you.> 
Speak with Assistant Greely inside the Gallywix Labor Mine on the Lost Isles.	The Gallywix Labor Mine	We barely escaped with our hides intact! The Trade Prince has a whole bunch of us enslaved and performing manual labor inside the cavern. Greely helped the seven of us to get out, but she was recaptured in the process. George, you're the only one crazy enough to walk into an exploding volcano! The assistant will be able to help you free the others. Hurry! This place is about to blow for good! 
Escort the Earthen Catapult safely to Needlerock Slag.	Close Escort	Alright, I think I've got it working again. You've got to get the catapult to the stone trogg town, Needlerock Slag, just to the north of the front. The driver will go with you. I'll head back and let Gravel know. There's no doubt that the stone troggs will try to stop you. You just keep them off of the catapult. It packs a big punch. Let me know when you're ready, George. 
You have been asked to kill 9 ghosts of any type in the Cursed Depths, just east of Baradin Hold.	Clearing the Depths	You are a sight for sore eyes, George. Now that we have claimed tol barad, the battle has just begun. We discovered a cell block just east of here that we need you to clear out. Turns out that its chock full of ghosts that have been locked up down there for who knows how long. Clear out as much as you can and report back to me when you are done. 
Destroy Blastshadow the Brutemaster's soulstone.	Throw It On the Ground!	This nightmare will never be over while Blastshadow the Brutemaster still breathes. There are a couple of problems though. One, being a warlock, he's got a succubus named Delicia Whipsnaps. If you kill Blastshadow quickly, the demon will go back to where it was summoned from. The second problem, since Blastshadow is a warlock, he has a soulstone that allows him to resurrect. You have to get his soulstone and destroy it so that he'll be dead forever! 
Buy some Shiny Bling from Gappy Silvertooth, a Hip New Outfit from Szabo, and some Cool Shades from Missa Spekkies on Swindle Street.	The New You	A new outfit? You don't say! There's quite a buzz surrounding your party. Everyone who's anyone on the island is going to be there. Well, happy shopping. Swindle Street has some of the best bargains anywhere! 
Decrypt 6 plans.	Decryption Made Easy	We don't have the tools to decipher these encrypted plans. The Twilight's Hammer do, though. Would you take the plans back up there and run them through their one-time decryption engines? 
Collect 8 Magmolias from the Magma Springs to the north.	Steal Magmolias	We've discovered a new species of flower growing in the Magma Springs to the north. Amazingly, they sustain themselves in pure molten lava! Please go and retrieve some specimens for me. I'm sure that further study of these plants will shed some light on your little friend here. Speaking of which, he seems quite eager to go with you. Let's hope he behaves himself. 
Obtain 8 samples of Flame Venom and 8 samples of Searing Web Fluid.	The Flame Spider Queen	The Widow's Clutch, to the northeast, is named after Beth'tilac, the enormous queen of the flame spiders. Her webs and her poison are a nagging threat to our main offensive force. We believe that if we study the flame spiders here on the Molten Front, we can use that information to find success against Beth'tilac. Use whatever methods you can to gather their venom and their web fluid, then return to my trusted friend Anren. 
Kill 9 Pei-Wu Tigers.	Preying on the Predators	The forest has become far more dangerous ever since Shen-zin Su began shaking. The tigers are agitated and have begun attacking the refugees, and on occasion, me as well. If these injured and weak survivors are to make it to safety here at the hut, we need to help clear the forest for them. 
Run through the Start Banner, hit the Blue Post, then the Green Post, then the Red Post, then return to the Start Banner.	Let's Keep Racing!	Want to keep racing, huh? That's the spirit! See if you can beat your best time! Get to the blue post, then green, then red, then back here. Your time matters, so do it fast! 
Get into the Bilgewater Buccaneer and then throw the Footbomb at 8 Steamwheedle Sharks.	Necessary Roughness	We're down to our last shredder. While no one was looking, I loaded it up with, shall we say, modified footbombs. Kid, I need you to get in that shredder and give 'em heck! 
Patch up 10 Injured Earthen.	Battlefront Triage	You seem quick on your feet, Human. I need someone to go out into the chaos of the front and patch up our injured. Take my kit. It's simple enough to use. Heal them before the stone troggs finish them off for good. 
Speak to Skylord Omnuron at Malfurion's Breach.	Flight of the Storm Crows	Many of the Druids of the Talon have made their way to the Molten Front, at your beckoning. You should go to Skylord Omnuron at Malfurion's Breach and see how their wings are faring in those burning skies. 
Use the Mine Cart to take a ride to the end of the line and then speak with Assistant Greely.	Wild Mine Cart Ride	All you have to do is jump in and speak with Assistant Greely when you get to the bottom. 
Slay Chip Endale.	What Kind of Name is Chip, Anyway?	Dude! You're never going to guess who's out on the oil platform to the north.<Ace shakes head in disbelief.>Chip's out there, and he's working for the Trade Prince. That traitor's now working for the other team. But worse, I heard he's going out with your ex-girlfriend, Candy Cane! I don't know about you, but if he was going out with my ex, I'd do something about it. 
Seek out Kor the Immovable among the Shuddering Spires.	Entrenched	Your intentions appear true. I will impress upon the other Stone Lords my wary trust. With this, they should speak to you. More importantly, they should listen. Earning their favor may take time. Earning the Stonemother's favor may take more time. Time is a potent offering, so be generous with it. Among the Shuddering Spires far to the northwest, you shall find Kor the Immovable. He is evenly tempered. His situation lends itself well to seeking outside aid. Go to him. 
Speak with Therazane at Therazane's Throne in Deepholm. Aggra can teleport you to Therazane's Throne from the Abyssal Breach.	Into Constant Earth	Time is short! My love lies in Deepholm. I will take us there when you are ready, and we will speak with Therazane the Stonemother. 
Recover 3 Uprooted Turnips, 3 Stolen Carrots, and 3 Pilfered Pumpkins.	Still Good!	The virmen to the south have been running off with all of our crops, but they're taking more than they can eat. They must be stockpiling them somewhere - the ones they like anyway. Will you go out and recover any of the uprooted crops you can find? I've got an island's worth of people to feed, and every single vegetable makes a difference. 
Defeat Aeosera.	Resonating Blow	On the western edge of the Pale Roost, you will find a resonating crystal. Strike it with the mallet and the broodmother will come. Be ready for battle. I will be there to aid you, but she will not be easily overcome. 
Speak with Aggra when you are ready to help Thrall. Then defeat the Elements of Patience and Corestones of Patience that are holding him captive.	Elemental Bonds: Patience	With the Stonemother's blessing, I can take us to where Go'el is being held. We must be careful. The Twilight's Hammer has agents all around. You help me hold them off while I attempt to get through to Go'el! Speak with me when you are ready, and I will take you to him. 
You have been tasked with collecting 8 Crocolisk Hides from the Baradin Crocolisks on Tol Barad. The crocolisks can be found in the swamp, just west of Baradin Hold.	Swamp Bait	Supplies are never easy to find in a place like this, Mechanic. We have been scouting since we captured the island but things are not looking good. Fortunately, we just received a scouting report that a swamp full of crocs is just west of our base camp here. The hides off those crocs will come in handy for our leatherworkers. Bring back as many as you can. 
Collect 5 Quartzite Resin.	Explosive Bonding Compound	This guy's the son of the Earthen leader! He almost made it to the temple when he got ambushed by more rock flayers than I can count! We know that the Earthen Stonefather has the middle fragment of the World Pillar. Maybe if we were to heal his son, the Stonefather would give us the fragment? My heals won't work on Flint here. But if we were to get some of the quartzite resin off of these monsters, I think I can make an explosive compound that will bond and cauterize his wounds. 
You have been tasked to kill Tank, a large shark cruising the waters of the Cape of Lost Hope. The cape can be found north of here, along the northern coastline.	Shark Tank	I hate sharks. All of my troops hate sharks too. This is where you come in, George. I need you to head up to the Cape of Lost Hope and take out a huge shark named Tank. Tank is not to be trifled with so I would bring a few friends if I were you. 
Defeat Master Li Fei in combat.	Only the Worthy Shall Pass	It is time for you to face me. With these three fires illuminating your potential, we will see with certainty whether your resolved soul is truly worthy of passing. 
Take the Field Journal to Sassy Hardwrench at Shipwreck Shore on the Lost Isles.	Orcs Can Write?	Looking through the dead orc's belongings, you find a field journal. Though it is heavily water damaged, the writing is still legible, if barely. Flipping through the pages, an interesting story unfolds. Good thing you decided to study Orcish. Like the Trade Prince's yacht, the orcs were fired upon by Alliance warships. You do remember an orc warship that you passed right before the Alliance opened fire. Maybe they were firing on the orcs instead of your ship? Stupid orcs! They got you sunk! 
Release Valves #1 - 4.	Release the Valves	We have to stop Trade Prince Gallywix's oil supply and bring his machines to a grinding halt. We're going to need you to go out to the KTC Oil Platform and release the valves to overload the coolant system. After you do that, head to the platform control panel on the platform and set it to blow. 
Slay 6 Tunneling Worms.	Trouble in the Mines	We've got trouble down in the Kaja'mine again, boss. The tunneling worms have returned and they're literally eating away at the Kajaro Trading Company's profits! Kaja'mite mining is down, which is negatively impacting our production of Kaja'Cola! I tried calling the exterminator, but he's fled with the last payment we made to him. Do you think you could head into the three mines and take care of it? I'd help but I still haven't attended the cartel-mandated fighter training seminar. 
Collect 6 Irestone Cores.	Core of Our Troubles	Elementals are chaotic by nature, but dis kind of organized aggression is out of character. More so down here where dere deaths be a bit more permanent. I suspect dis is Therazane the Stonemother's doin', but I have to be sure. Destroy da Irestone Rumblers and bring me their cores. We'll be settlin' here and now if dis is da Stonemother's hatred brought down on us. 
Collect 8 Chalky Crystal Formations.	Making Things Crystal Clear	Among the Shuddering Spires are crystals. White, chalky crystals. We can absorb these crystals into our skin. To cleanse us. Purify us. I do not stride among the stones any longer. I am one with the earth. This carries many boons, but I can no longer retrieve the crystals for myself. Bring me the crystals that I might be stronger. Carry them away from the flayers. Away from my sons. This honor should be mine. 
Recover an Enormous Ruby Crystal Cluster.	Beneath the Surface	Among the other precious gemstones hidden deep out of our reach in the Crumbling Depths, there are enormous ruby crystal clusters. They are infused with terrible energy. It will not be easy to obtain such a thing, for they are well guarded. But you, you are stubborn and brave. I think this is something you can do. Within the Crumbling Depths, look to where the tunnels end abruptly in stone. The clusters are found in those passages when they are to be found at all. Should you find one, return to me. 
Speak to Old Man Liang at Liang's Retreat in the Singing Pools.	Finding an Old Friend	It seems Shu, the spirit of water, had a play companion when he came to the pools throughout the years. An old pandaren we know as Old Man Liang. Liang moved away from the main town and stopped practicing in the pools some time ago. I am told he lives in a small house northeast of here, up the hill. Liang may know what has driven Shu away, and where the spirit might be found. Go to Liang. Ask of Shu. 
Bring Shu and Wugou, the spirits of water and earth, to the Temple of Five Dawns. A cart is waiting near the road to take you there.	The Spirit and Body of Shen-zin Su	Well, that wraps it up here, doesn't it George? Now that we've got these two roused and all friendly towards you, we just need to get them back to the Temple of Five Dawns. You go ahead. I'm going to say my goodbyes, then I'll follow you up shortly. 
Board the Hot Air Balloon and Speak to Shen-zin Su.	The Suffering of Shen-zin Su	Now is not the time to grieve. The balloon is ready, and Shen-zin Su awaits. We shall be the first pandaren to speak to Shen-zin Su in hundreds of years. It is a great honor. 
Interact with the Mine Cart outside the Gallywix Labor Mine on the Lost Isles.	Light at the End of the Tunnel	Okay, we have got to get out of here before she blows for good! Let's head out the other end of the tunnel on the north side of the mine. We should be able to use one of the mine carts for a quick ride down the side of the volcano. 
Aid 6 Dormant Stonebound Elementals in reforming.	Putting the Pieces Together	Human. If you act in the service of the Stone Lords, there are those that might aid you. Watch for the Stonebound. They lie dormant all around the Shuddering Spires. It should not take much prompting to rebind them to service against the flayers. 
Find the Painite within the Crumbling Depths.	Depth of the Depths	<The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of Diamant speaks as if from the stone itself.>Well done, Human. Within the tunnels below, you will find the stone which you seek. Painite. The dangers ahead are many...Dangers that the Stone Lords themselves fear. Remain steady. Remain strong. The strength of the rock itself is beneath your feet. 
Speak with Examiner Rowe at the Temple of Earth in Deepholm.	The Reliquary	We have a contingent of the Reliquary in the chamber just to the northeast inside the temple. They've been making increasing noises about something that the Twilight's Hammer is up to. George, would you be a dear and see what they need? 
You have been tasked with recovering 7 pieces of Siege Engine Scrap. Use the Magnetized Scrap Collector in The Restless Front to find the scraps. The Restless Front is due west, just past the second bridge.	Magnets, How Do They Work?	Getting useful machine parts out here on the island has been difficult, George. We have been trying to repair the broken siege engines here in camp but we keep running out of useful parts. Our second regiment reported some wrecked out siege engines in a old battlefield to the west. Maybe we could find some parts over there? You are going to have trouble finding anything in that old battlefield so take this magnetized scrap collector and put it to some good use. 
Retrieve 8 Crates of Tools.	Get Our Stuff Back!	Our bombs and tools! Those sneaky monkeys to the east stole them all in the dead of night! Can you go out there and get them back for us, George? Without those tools, we have absolutely no way to get off of this island! 
Speak to Maruut Stonebinder in the Temple of Earth.	Word In Stone	You have done as I've asked of you, Human. I shall honor my word. Gorsik will meet you at the temple with our piece of the World Pillar. Finish your ritual and bind the rift. After you have done such, tell your Earthen Ring to leave this place. You however... you can stay for a time if you want. You've earned at least that. 
Slay 10 Alliance Paratroopers.	Repel the Paratroopers	The Alliance have caught back up with us at just the wrong moment, my friend. We took care of their ships, but they still have planes that are dropping their vaunted 127th Paratroopers onto the coast below. It's all that the battlesworn and scouts can do to hold the two ramps against their overwhelming numbers. I'm certain that if you were to aid them, the tide would quickly be turned. 
Make your way to the Rebel Camp.	Warn the Rebel Camp	Dis death ain't be in vain, George. We figure out dat Kilnara be on da prowl. Tings don't look good. We better check out da Rebel Camp to da north. Maybe we find my contact dere. 
Use Ricket's Tickers to gather 3 Deep Alabaster Crystals, 3 Deep Celestite Crystals, 3 Deep Amethyst Crystals, and 3 Deep Garget Crystals.	Underground Economy	Hey! I need some help gatherin' crystals. The elementals trade top dollar for these things... if you help me gather all the different kinds, I'll cut you in on the profits. Use these bombs to blow out chunks from the bigger formations. I've got a nasty habit of packin' the explosives a bit thick. Mind the kick. 
Find Maziel's Journal at the Lower Silvermarsh in Deepholm.	Maziel's Revelation	The notes continue Maziel's rambling research into the properties of quicksilver and mercurial oozes. He appears to have made a major discovery. He mentions hiding his journal in the Lower Silvermarsh to the southwest. 
Collect 20 Cinderweb Eggs from the pillars in The Widow's Clutch.	Egg-stinction	We have a real problem on our hands. Not only are the nearby spiders vicious and predatory, their numbers appear to be endless. We need to stop the growth of their army. Cut their heads off in the egg, not on the battlefield. The Cinderweb Spinners' eggs are laid among the stone pillars to the north. Collect 20 eggs and bring them back to me. 
Slay 8 Flamewakers within the Molten Flow.	Flamewakers of the Molten Flow	Of all Ragnaros' minions, the flamewakers appear to be the most devoted. Most of them dwell within this cave, preparing for another attack. Our foothold may be strong, but we will not tolerate any surprise attacks from these worms. No, we will strike first. Tear them apart, George. 
Defeat the Fire Hawk Matriarch.	Mother's Malice	Unsurprisingly, their matriarch has taken offense to us taking her young to train for our own uses. It's understandable... and a bit tragic actually. We are very much the villains in this exchange. Now is not the time for such thoughts. These creatures are beings of fire, and on more than one occasion, they've claimed the lives of our kin. With their matriarch angered, the danger has grown immensely. I need someone to quiet her rage, and I fear you may be the most capable. 
Speak to Terrath the Steady at the Pale Roost.	Steady Hand	Nearby to the north, you will find Terrath the Steady. He has taken upon the task of pulling the stone dragons back into the fold. We find ourselves repeating this trial every few hundred years... the stone dragons are fickle, and bend only to strength. Terrath is balanced and reasonable, but his goals may not be easily accomplished. Go to him. Appeal to the more balanced side of the Stonemother. 
Return to Pyrium Lodestone at Needlerock Slag in Deepholm.	A Slight Problem	While you were out there, Pyrium Lodestone contacted me. He said that there is a matter of great urgency and that your assistance is needed immediately. Return to him at the entrance to Needlerock Slag to the southwest. I wish you luck with the rescue of the Stonefather and the recovery of the middle fragment. 
Go to the Upper Silvermarsh in Deepholm.	Silvermarsh Rendezvous	Excellent work, George. We know exactly where the meeting location is. The Upper Silvermarsh is a mercury swamp to the east of here. It's normally only inhabited by elementals and occasional stone troggs, but our scouts have seen some Twilight activity in the region. Make your way there and let's find a way to eavesdrop on the Forgemaster's meeting. 
Defeat Jaomin Ro.	The Disciple's Challenge	George, I see great strength and great courage in you, and an unsurpassed purity of soul. The hour is young, but I think you may be ready to face a greater challenge. Go to the bottom of the stairs, and cross the bridge. There, you will find Jaomin Ro, one of our eldest students. Challenge and defeat him in honorable combat, and this first phase of your training will be complete. 
Get in the Bilgewater Buccaneer and score the winning goal by kicking the Footbomb through the smokestacks behind the opposing goal.	Fourth and Goal	It's all up to you, kid. You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.<The coach leans in close and whispers in your ear.>Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right. I don't want you to just kick a goal... I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal! I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need. Now get out there and make me proud! 
Use the Elementium Grapple Line to pull 3 Servants of Therazane off of their feet.	On Even Ground	We're fortunate dat those giants be havin' such bad aim. Luck is sure to be favorin' dem eventually though. We need to get dem off da battlefield, but I don't tink takin' dem head on would be very smart. Take dis grapplin' line, get a good hold on one of their ankles and pull their legs out from under dem. Once dey are on da ground, dey should be easy ta be finishin' off. 
Kill 12 Twilight invaders and 1 Desecrated Earthrager.	Undying Twilight	The Twilight Cultists are here! They're trying to stop the ritual! Get to the back chambers and help fight them off! 
Speak to Master Li Fei in the Shrine of Inner-Light.	The Spirit's Guardian	You've done very well this far, my student. You have the materials you need to rekindle Huo, the spirit of fire. In the cave to the southwest he awaits, but he is guarded by Master Li Fei, the pandaren elder you met in the Cave of Meditation. Go to Master Li Fei with the offerings. Prove yourself, then meet with Huo. 
Use the Weed Whacker within your Goblin All-In-1der Belt to mow down 100 of the plants within the Vicious Vale.	Weed Whacker	<Kilag barely has time to acknowledge you between rifle shots, but his eye does linger a moment on your Goblin All-In-1-der Belt appreciatively.>Now is the time for creative solutions. Pull something out of that belt and get to work!<Thinking about the situation for a moment, an idea comes to your mind and it's just crazy enough to work!> 
Kill 8 Thornbranch Scamps.	Unwelcome Nature	You faced forest sprites in the Dawning Valley, but the forest sprites in this grove are a different breed. Crueler and more dangerous. If you would clear some of these sprites out, the spirits would thank you. 
Use the Irresistible Pool Pony to lure 12 Naga Hatchlings.	Irresistible Pool Pony	I've got a plan and you're the only one that I know crazy enough to pull it off! I need you to take this irresistible pool pony to the Vashj'elan Spawning Pool and inflate it. Then, swim down to their hatchlings with it on. I'll bet anything that the hatchlings can be lured away to follow you. Bring them back here and we'll proceed with the next phase of the plan. 
Speak with Thrall at the Warchief's Lookout on the Lost Isles.	The Warchief Wants You	True to his word, Thrall is going to get us going in the right direction to rescue our people. He asked to speak with you. Good luck, George. We're all depending on you. 
Go to Deathwing's Fall in Deepholm.	Deathwing's Fall	The Twilight's Hammer involvement in the disappearance of the World Pillar fragment makes complete sense. Let us hope that we can act swiftly enough to recover it.<Maruut places his hand on your shoulder.>I've established a spiritual bond with you. We should be able to communicate while you remain in Deepholm. Go to Deathwing's Fall to the southeast and investigate the Twilight's Hammer operation there. 
Free Stonefather Oremantle.	Rescue the Stonefather... and Flint	We found out where the Stonefather is being held and young Flint ran off on his own to rescue him! I don't have to tell you that this is bad. Flint is going to get himself captured as well, or worse! The stone trogg chieftain, Bouldergut, is at the end of the ledges above Needlerock Chasm to the north. Please, George, you must go after Flint and free the Stonefather before we lose them both! 
Acquire the Fire, Water, and Air Wards, and then slay Haethen Kaul.	Fight Fire and Water and Air with...	Did you hear the man going on with his incessant yelling while you were up there? That's Haethen Kaul, their leader. It's a well known fact that he's gone insane from the power he's drawing from their bound elementals. Unfortunately, it makes him nigh invincible. If you're to fight him, you'll first have to kill each of the elementals, gaining their wards in the process. That should protect you from Haethen's magic. Well, most of it anyway. 
Witness the memories stored within the Smoke-Stained Locket.	Unlocking the Secrets Within	The initials seem to have worn off of this locket, but I can sense a power within it that suggests only one possible owner:Leyara, the Druid of the Flame. Stand back, and we shall see what surprises this locket contains. 
Gather 8 Hard Tearwood Reeds.	Stronger Than Reeds	Gather me reeds from the nearby pools. Do not question why. Do, and then observe the results. 
Bring the Captain's Log to Maruut Stonebinder at the Temple of Earth in Deepholm.	Captain's Log	<You leaf to the final, interrupted entry.>...approaching the Temple of Earth at 300 knots and commencing landing maneuvers according to new route. We've made note of a low pressure system in the north and redrawn our...BLOOD AND THUNDER! ALLIANCE SCUM APPROACH!! 
Gather 12 Petrified Stone Bats for Pebble.	Petrified Delicacies	Petrified bats. Elementals of that size are picky. You're not likely to find anything better easily. To the east are basilisks. They petrify stone bats that fly too close and snack on them when they grow hungry. You may find bats scattered around their territory. I must warn you... if you show that little elemental too much attention, you're unlikely to be rid of it. It can be very... needy. 
Kill 8 Verlok Pillartumblers in the lower section of Verlok Stand.	Shaken and Stirred	I have sent my brothers to assault the Verlok village from below. The Verlok will gather on their rocky ledges, as they always do to avoid our ire. When they do, we shall make the earth itself shake them until they fall at our feet below. That is where you prove your use. When they fall to the ground amongst my brothers, make sure that they do not rise again. 
Defeat Zoltrik Drakebane.	The Twilight Flight	Terrath wants you to make your way to the far end of the precipice to fight Zoltrik Drakebane. He is on his way there as well, but he thinks Zoltrik is likely to take to the sky. Quite an impression you seem to have made, little one. Have you ever mused that none of this would have happened if I had just stepped on you during our first meeting? Fate is a strange thing. 
Present yourself to Stonefather Oremantle at Stonehearth in Deepholm.	The Hero Returns	The Stonefather is waiting for you back south at Stonehearth. Make yourself presentable. You've earned a hero's welcome! 
Kill 8 Charred Soldiers or Charred Vanquishers.	Hostile Elements	The elementals continue to press on us, and I do not expect them to subside any time soon. You'll find them pouring across the Ashen Fields to the north. Thin their ranks. 
Slay Candy Cane.	What Kind of Name is Candy, Anyway?	Can you believe that Candy Cane! You know up until you ""dealt"" with Chip, she was dating him. Now she's going out with the Trade Prince! I just can't get over the fact that she betrayed you like that with your ex. Maybe you should head down into the Slave Pits and take care of her once and for all? 
Find the Forgemaster's Log at Deathwing's Fall in Deepholm.	The Forgemaster's Log	Go to the tower the slave spoke of. You should find it on the northeastern end of the camp. If we can act fast enough we might be able to eavesdrop on the forgemaster's meeting. 
Speak with Slate Quicksand at Needlerock Chasm in Deepholm.	Down Into the Chasm	Down below in Needlerock Chasm is where the mystics are sprouting all of these fungal monstrosities. I sent Slate Quicksand and a small force to deal with it, but they've run into a snag. You remember the Arch Geomancer? Would you fly down there to the northeast and lend him a hand? 
Slay the Tides of Longing and Vortexes of Longing near the Abyssal Breach until Thrall is free of their grasp.	Elemental Bonds: Desire	Once again, Mechanic, I cannot do this without your help. I will try to quiet this tempest, but you will need to fight back the unstable elementals that whirl around it. Only then can we free Go'el! 
Use the Guardian's Staff to summon and defeat Galenges.	The Power of Malorne	<Matoclaw's voice continues.>The portal that opened up to our east is guarded by a powerful flamewaker by the name of Galenges. We will need all of Malorne's help in defeating him. Do you remember the staff that I gave you? Place it in the pile of ash in front of the portal. Then pray that Malorne comes to your aid. 
Lead a Hyjal Wisp to one of the fire portals in the Ashen Fields, and protect the wisp until it closes the portal. If you lose your wisp, return to Rayne Feathersong at Malfurion's Breach.	Wisp Away	The fire elementals are pouring out of portals on the far side of the Ashen Fields. We need someone to close them. Cut off some of their reinforcements. Banishing these kinds of elemental magics is something our wisps are perfectly suited for. One will come with you. Lead it to a portal and keep it alive until it finishes. 
You must kill Svarnos in the D-Block and return with his Cursed Collar. Svarnos can be found in the D-Block, just northwest of Baradin Hold.	Svarnos	Excellent work on the island capture, Mechanic. Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners. D-Block has been especially hard to clear out. Unfortunately it has become overrun with demons of all sorts. We have been able to thin out the demons but a large core hound has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there. I need you to kill him and bring back his collar. 
Defeat 6 Huojin Trainees or Tushui Trainees.	The Lesson of Stifled Pride	Facing a living opponent is a very different thing from the stationary targets in the yard. Living opponents strike back. There is the very real fear of failure, and sometimes, even death. You must have the courage to overcome those fears. Challenge the other trainees within the temple or down the steps below, and defeat them. 
Retrieve the Sun Pearl.	The Sun Pearl	Shu, the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of Shen-zin Su. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy. For all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend. 
Use Kaja'Cola Zero-One to free Ace, Izzy, Gobber, and 6 Goblin Survivors or Kezan Citizens.	Morale Boost	You've got to get all the Kaja'Cola Zero-One that you can and make the goblins drink it to boost their morale and free them! 
Jump on Stormbeak and watch Mor'norokk's interrogation.	Some Spraining to Do	Hop on, George. Let's see what Mr. Ogreface has to say for himself. Don't be shy, Stormbeak's only ever dropped a passenger a couple of times before. 
Gather 5 samples of Blood of Neltharion from Living Blood at Deathwing's Fall.	Blood of the Earthwarder	When Deathwing escaped to Deepholm, his corruption was extreme, but perhaps not yet absolute. The cultists at Deathwing's Fall harvest and shape the corrupted blood he left behind into living organisms to draw from their power. What if a trace of the Earthwarder's essence remains? After all, Neltharion was the aspect of earth before he was the aspect of death. Gather samples from the living blood the cultists have created and we'll see if any trace of the Earthwarder remains. 
Speak to Kor to find out what kind of food Pebble might like.	So Big, So Round...	<Pebble looks around, excited by something. After a few seconds of confusion, he stops and stares up at you with big, glowy gem eyes.>Hug-nery... hungry...<Try as you might, there's no resisting those eyes. Maybe Kor knows what mini-mentals like to eat?> 
Obtain 5 Luciferns.	Fire Flowers	My fellow druid, Choluna, has asked us to collect any specimens of plant life that we might find here in the Firelands......I don't know whose idea it was to bring scholars to a warfront. Nevertheless, you will already be in the cave - killing things - so be on the lookout for anything growing out of the ground. 
Destroy 5 Training Targets.	The Lesson of the Sandy Fist	I'd like to observe you putting your new weapon to use, my young student. This will aid me in determining what degree of training will be best suited to your talents. We have many training targets in the training grounds below. Practice your attacks upon them, and return to me once you're feeling comfortable with your new weapon. 
Recover 6 Training Supplies from Amberleaf Scamps.	Items of Utmost Importance	Amberleaf scamps swarmed my cart and stole most of the training supplies I was bringing up to the training grounds. They've always been troublemakers, but they've never been this aggressive before. I don't know what happened. Please, help me recover my supplies. 
Defeat 6 Tushui Monks atop the balance poles.	The Lesson of the Balanced Rock	I require peace to perform my meditation. Practice your arts while I meditate on Shu's location. Other monks practice balance and combat upon the balance poles in the surrounding pools. Engage them and defeat them. 
Gather 12 Discarded Wood Planks.	Stronger Than Wood	Gather me wood planks from construction near the Ki-Han Brewery. You do not yet know the extent of my strength, so I shall display it to you. 
Return to the Temple of Five Dawns. A cart is waiting near the Wreck of the Skyseeker to take you there.	New Allies	George, I did what had to be done. And the plan worked. Things could have been much worse had we not acted. I only wish Aysa could understand that. There will be plenty of time for reflection, but for now, we need to return to the Temple of Five Dawns. We need to let them know that Shen-zin Su has been saved, and we need to sort out the fates of these new allies. 
Speak with Coach Crosscheck at Kajaro Field on Kezan.	Report for Tryouts	George, Coach Crosscheck is looking for you. He's the leader of our fearless footbomb team, the Bilgewater Buccaneers. He says that the division title against the Steamwheedle Sharks is on the line and that you're the only one that can bring it home for us! Head west into town. You can't miss Kajaro Field. A footbomb star. This is going to be great for your image! 
Slay 6 Twilight Saboteurs.	Take No Prisoners	It looks like the Twilight's Hammer's still on the ship. Go below decks and take them out. Be careful, George. I've a feeling they're not here for a spiritual retreat, if you know what I mean. 
Kill any 8 invaders from the Firelands in the Regrowth or Sethria's Roost.	Rage Against the Flames	Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders. The very nature of fire is that it is all-consuming. Lower your defense for just a moment and it will destroy everything in sight. Kill any of the fiery invaders you find. Every enemy defeated purchases more time for Hyjal. 
Use the Waygate Controller to punch in the wrong activation sequence, thereby destroying the Waygate.	The Wrong Sequence	The Twilight's Hammer must be stopped from using the Waygate. There's only one thing to do. Punch in the wrong activation sequence and destroy it. Hmm, let's see. Yes, here's one that opens upon the explosive depths of the Firelands, the elemental plane of fire. That should do nicely. 
Collect 12 Kaja'mite Chunks.	Liberate the Kaja'mite	<Sir/Ma'am>, we need tons of moolah to pay the Trade Prince and get off Kezan! Well, tons of it is just waiting for the taking down there in the Kaja'mine! These are the last known deposits of kaja'mite anywhere. This is the raw stuff that made us the genius tinkerers and alchemists we are today. If that's not worth a bazillion macaroons, I don't know what is! Take some of my kablooey bombs and blowup the deposits. Then, pick up the chunks. Just watch out for the rebellious trolls! 
Speak with the FBoK Bank Teller at the First Bank of Kezan on Kezan.	Off to the Bank	Yo, baby. Wassup? You ready for the party? No?! You know I love you, so I don't know how to say this, but check it... I think you need to swing into town to buy a new outfit for the party. Don't look at me like that... you want to look gooood, right? Don't you want to look super fine for me? I am your boyfriend after all! Swing by the bank first and pull out plenty of macaroons. You don't want to buy any of that cheap stuff! 
Use the Explosive Bonding Compound on Flint Oremantle.	Apply and Flash Dry	Alright, take this and apply it to his wounds. If the cauterizing effect of the flash dry explosion doesn't crack him wide open, it should completely heal him. I think. 
Grant the Stonefather's Boon to 12 Earthen Defenders.	Stonefather's Boon	With the Stonefather taken prisoner, our forces are demoralized. Normally any one of mine could take five times his number of stone troggs. But now....I want you to head out into the field surrounding the town. Plant Stonefather Oremantle's banner near my defenders. Grant them his boon and remind them of that for which they fight. 
Collect 6 Elemental Ore.	Elemental Ore	You're going to have to deal with the leader of Therazane's forces here. However, to get you to him quickly and safely, I'm going to need to perform a ritual. Go out into the field and collect elemental ore from the ragers. With enough of it, I should be able to make you one with the ground to get you where you need to go. 
Observe the Crimson Lasher drinking from 6 Ember Pools. Ember Pools are created by fighting Emberspit Scorpions.	Some Like It Hot	I've been making progress in my research, George. Based on what we've witnessed in the local flora, it's quite possible that your Lasher also accepts superheated liquids as a principal source of nutrition. I'd like you to help me with a little experiment. The Emberspit Scorpions that inhabit the Magma Springs to the north spew out burning pools of fire during combat. Take the Lasher and observe his reaction to the scorpions' Ember Pools. 
Request Shu's help in waking Wugou, the spirit of earth.	Not In the Face!	Alright George, I was thinking about what we'd try next if the whole gong thing didn't work, and it came to me just like that! Water in the face always worked on me. It's got to be twice as effective for someone so dry and earthy! Mind going over and asking Shu, the spirit of water, if he'll help us out? He should be playing in the pool next to the waterfall, just on the other side of that tree. 
Deliver the Field Journal to Aggra at the Horde Base Camp on the Lost Isles.	The Enemy of My Enemy	I hate to ask you to do this, but I guess it's why they pay you the big bucks. Can you deliver that dead orc's field journal to whoever is in charge up at their camp? Based on the writing in the book, they should be located at the top of the island, up the incline past the Kaja'mite cavern to the southeast. Good luck, George. I always liked you. 
Use the Delicate Chain Smasher to release 6 Quartz Rocklings.	Loose Stones	The Twilight Cultists are taking my rocklings among them. They drain them and torture them. Strip them of the very essence that animates them from the stone. Please, Human, free my rocklings. Neither Diamant nor I have the delicacy to smash their chains without hurting them as well. But we do have a tool you might use. Use this. Break their chains and set them free. 
Kill 8 Fungal Behemoths.	Gone Soft	The fungal behemoths that surround us have succumbed to a weakness very similar to that that affects your kind. Their skin has grown soft. They no longer belong with the stone. Kill them. We do not wish to see this infection spread. 
Destroy 10 Ghastly Supply Boats.	Bombs Away!	The Wellson Shipyard is constantly receiving supplies from offshore and we need to put a stop to it. They have setup cannons along the docks for defense but if you can make it to them, we can use them to destroy their supply ships. Head down there and see what you can do. Report back to me on your progress. 
Find Kilag Gorefang and his scouts at the Wild Overlook on the Lost Isles.	Forward Movement	Kilag should be in position by now. It is time for you to move forward to the Wild Overlook. The rest of us will pack up here and move out soon. Just follow the path northwest through the Vicious Vale. Not so vicious any longer thanks to you, eh? Kilag and his scouts will be keeping themselves hidden just off the path, but the SI:7 assassins are sure to spot them soon, so hurry! 
Help the Earthen Geomancers to get out of combat and then give them the Rockslide Reagents so that they can seal the Armory, Inn, Barracks, and Shrine.	Sealing the Way	The stone troggs have found a way to burrow up from underneath our homes! I've sent our geomancers to seal all of the buildings, but they need these reagents and enough time out of battle to properly cast their rockslide rituals. When you're done, report to, Gravel Longslab, just to the north on the Fractured Front. 
Speak to Therazane on the Halcyon Egress.	Our Part of the Bargain	Sadly, I must stay and hold the rift, so you will have to battle without me. Go now to Therazane and join the battle, as promised. You should find her at the Halcyon Egress, north of Lorthuna's Gate and east of the Scoured Reach. When our part of the bargain is fulfilled, bring the last piece of the World Pillar here as quickly as possible. 
You have been instructed to kill 10 demons of any type in the D-Block, just northwest of Baradin Hold.	D-Block	Have you heard of the D-Block yet George? It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island. Problem is, it's infested with demons. We planned on using it to lock up the leftover Horde we found on the island, but that is not going to happen in its current state. I need you to head down there and clear those demons out. Report back to me when you are done. 
Kill 12 Darkwood Lurkers in The Darkwood. The Darkwood forest is just north of here, across the bridge on the central island.	Thinning the Brood	We have been trying to get a foothold in The Darkwood for weeks now but that forest is infested with spiders. Do me a favor and see if you can thin them out enough for us to set up an attack. Careful out there, I have heard reports of Alliance troops nearby earlier in the week. 
Bring the Smoke-Stained Locket to the Night Elf Grave near Astranaar in Ashenvale.	Tragedy and Family	You were insightful to bring this locket to me, George. I am among the few who know where Valstann's body lays. You can find his resting site in a small graveyard, southeast of Astranaar, in Ashenvale. Bring this locket to the site, and it may unlock more memories. Farewell, George, and good luck on your journey. 
Retrieve a Fluttering Breeze.	Fanning the Flames	Strange thing about wind, it can be hard to wrap your hands around it. Best practice for me has been finding some sort of living wind. If it can punch you, you can punch it back, and it won't slip through your grasp. Head over to the Shrine of the Summer Breeze to the south and summon just such a living wind using this wind stone. Best it, gather a Fluttering Breeze from it, and come back over this way so that we can figure out what's next. 
Bring Elder Shu 50 Volatile Blooms.	Handle With Care	I've seen the numbers these invaders have brought with them, this will not be an easy victory. I do know of one thing that may help us gain an advantage. There is a plant that grows around the village that can be used to make a rather effective explosive liquid. If you can gather enough I can begin brewing the mixture. The plant you are looking for is appropriately named volatile bloom. Handle it with care, Mechanic. 
Use the Single-Stage Booster Rockets to launch the cages of 8 Kezan Citizens or Goblin Survivors.	Escape Velocity	We really don't have time to rescue those that are incompetent enough to get themselves captured over and over. Still, since I have some extra rockets leftover, this problem should be a snap. Take these single-stage booster rockets down into the Slave Pits to the north and put them on the cages. The cage will lift off into orbit and those idiots will be freed. 
Speak with Thrall under the World Tree in Mount Hyjal and witness the Earthen Ring ceremony.	The Nordrassil Summit	Hello, Mechanic! My brothers and sisters of the Earthen Ring have spoken well of your deeds in the wake of the Cataclysm. But much remains to be done if we are to heal this broken world. Walk with me, friend. Preparations for a ceremony are underway, a ritual that I hope will be a turning point in our battle against the Twilight's Hammer. When all is done, you will be able to spread the word about our triumph here. 
Speak to Captain Saynna Stormrunner at Malfurion's Breach.	The Hunt Begins	The Shadow Wardens have joined the fight at the Molten Front, on your request. You should find Captain Saynna Stormrunner and see to it that they've found a way to best apply their skills. 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at the Slave Pits.	The Slave Pits	Sassy's over at the Slave Pits. She's there with the orcs getting ready to execute the final play on the Trade Prince. George, take the footbomb uniform up the road to the southwest and find her. I know she's going to want you to lead the charge! Ack, I'm starting to talk like the coach now! 
Speak to the ""fleshling"" intruders in the Crimson Expanse.	Familiar Intruders	Fleshling. Some of your kind skitter among the rocks. Too cowardly to approach, too swift to be crushed. If you wish my favor, deal with them. I tire of these games. 
You have been asked to recover 8 Cursed Shackles from the D-Block, just northwest of Baradin Hold.	Cursed Shackles	Have you been down in the D-Block yet, George? Every time we clear that infested cellblock out, the demons seem to return rather quickly. We learned that they regenerate from the cursed shackles scattered around the area. That's where you come in to the picture George. I need you to retrieve as many of those shackles as you can and bring them back to me. We will destroy them immediately. 
Kill Foreman Wellson at the Wellson Shipyard. The shipyard can be found northwest of here, on the western coast.	WANTED: Foreman Wellson	Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here. His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them. He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard. I need you to take out Wellson for good this time. Be careful George, we have been receiving reports of filthy Horde all around the area. 
Sergeant Gray has asked you to kill Commander Largo at Largo's Overlook. The overlook is just northeast of the base camp.	Taking the Overlook Back	There is only one way for us to take Largo's Overlook back. I think you know what we need to do George. Largo is pretty paranoid these days so you should be able to find him on top of the tower, looking for his imaginary navy to finally arrive. 
Cross the balance poles and ring the training bell.	The Lesson of Dry Fur	Through meditation, I intend to find a route to locating Shu. In the meantime, you would benefit from practice and discipline. Your first task is the task of all trainees entering the pools: cross the balance poles to the west and ring the bell without falling into the pool. Should you fall, the pool's curse will make it difficult to get on a pole again, so you will need to return to the edge of the pool to start over. Oh, and beware the cranes. 
Listen to Master Shang Xi.	Passing Wisdom	This journey shall soon be yours to undertake without me. Stay for a few moments and listen to an old man's words. Let my knowledge serve as a foundation for yours, that you might be greater than I ever was. 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at the Town-In-A-Box on the Lost Isles.	Get Back to Town	We were wrong. It wasn't the naga that were preparing to attack... it was the nearby Oomlot tribe. George, you need to get back to the Town-In-A-Box. The pygmies are already attacking! Here, take this. We bought it off of a pygmy who said it used to belong to some great leader of theirs. Someone whose name translates as Dark Tan Helmet. It should fool them so that they don't attack you. 
You need to recover 9 Cursed Femur bones from the ghouls that inhabit Forgotten Hill. Forgotten Hill is on the west side of the island, just past The Forgotten Front.	Salvaging the Remains	Forgotten Hill has been overrun with zombies and ghouls ever since we reclaimed this wretched isle. We have tried to clear them out many times but they always seem to come back. One of our lieutenants recommended taking the ghouls' bones when we kill them in hopes that they can't reincarnate overnight. Think you can help us out with this one? 
Retrieve 8 Kun-Pai Ritual Charms.	Small, But Significant	I am tired, George. I must rest. We have a ritual to perform, but we require some of the charms from this grove. If you wander the grove, you should see them all over hanging from the trees. If it does not offend one as young as you, will you permit me to sit and recover my strength while you gather these charms? 
Climb to the top of the mountain of explosives and use the Town-In-A-Box Plunger.	It's a Town-In-A-Box	The trade prince had an entire town-in-a-box in the ship's hold! I managed to recover it while you were out saving all of our skins. Do you want to do the honors? All you have to do is climb to the top of that huge pile of explosives and push the plunger, and whamo kablamo, instant town! 
Recover 8 Crates of Medical Supplies.	Medical Supplies	We need supplies to tend to our wounded, but the supply crates containing them were scattered in the crash. If you can bring back any crates you find, I would be very grateful. 
Detonate 10 Land Mines.	Mine Disposal, the Goblin Way	The paratroopers have mined the beach! The Warchief asked me if there's anything we can do about that. I told him, 'You bet we can!'. I was thinking maybe you could take this satchel of grenades and detonate the land mines from a safe distance? It's how we do things, right?! 
Rip the Fickle Heart from out of Candy Cane's chest.	She Loves Me, She Loves Me NOT!	Oh, sweetie! You're never going to guess who's down in the slave pits to the north.<Sassy shakes her head sadly at you.>Candy's down there, and she's working for the Trade Prince. She dropped you like a bad habit and now she's working for the other team. but it gets worse. Since you ""dealt"" with Chip, she's dating the Trade Prince! I don't know about you, but if she were my ex, I'd rip her fickle heart right out of her chest. 
Hand over your Life Savings to Trade Prince Gallywix aboard the Trade Prince's Yacht on Kezan.	Life Savings	We've got all of the moolah that we need. There's only one thing left to do now, boss: get you to the Trade Prince's yacht. It's about to leave port! We're gonna have to hurry. Hop in, 'cause I'm driving! 
Speak to Gorsik the Tumultuous in the Crimson Expanse.	Unnatural Causes	This is most definitely magic in origin. Not even druidic. I suspect one among the stone troggs to the north. Go to Gorsik and point him in their direction. Hopefully this will help earn his favor. 
You have been asked to recover four Dusty Prison Journals from the Cursed Depths, just east of Baradin Hold.	Learning From The Past	Now that we finally have a hold on this wretched island, we can start to investigate how it got in this condition. Some of our troops have discovered journals around the entrance to Cursed Depths cellblock just east of here. These journals are of particular interest to our elder scribes back at base camp. I need you to recover four of them and bring them back to me as fast as you can. George, be careful down there, that place is crawling with undead. 
Retrieve 5 Embergris from Charred Soldiers and Charred Vanquishers.	Embergris	The Crimson Lasher has developed some cracking blisters on its vines. Without treatment, this condition could be life threatening. Luckily, the Charred Soldiers and Charred Vanquishers in the area produce a waxy substance known as Embergris, which should soothe the Lasher's pain. Bring me some of this substance, and kill those nasty fire elementals while you're at it. 
Speak to Elderlimb at Malfurion's Breach.	Aid of the Ancients	The ancients have seen the value of your wisdom, and have set root at Malfurion's Breach. You should seek out Elderlimb. I am certain he would like to hear from you. 
You have been asked to recover 6 Barrels of Southsea Rum from the shipwrecks on the Cape of Lost Hope. The cape can be found north of here, along the coast.	Boosting Morale	Morale is low these days, George. We make every effort we can to keep the troops in high spirits but we are running low on our main supply of morale booster... rum. I have been getting reports from our infantry to the south that the shipwrecks on the Cape of Lost Hope still have a good supply of southsea rum in their wrecked hulls. Can you head up there and investigate? Bring back any rum you can find. 
	Zul'Aman Reward Quest	 
Use the Rockin' Powder Infused Rocket Boots and deliver them to Hobart Grapplehammer.	Rocket Boot Boost	You need to get those boots down into the caldera to Hobart Grapplehammer. Now that they're infused with the leftover rockin' powder, they should have enough thrust to get you all the way there on one shot. When you're ready, activate the boots. Don't worry, they're automatically set to land you safely. I think. 
Escort the Frightened Miner through the Kaja'mite Cavern.	Miner Troubles	Smart mining monkeys! They're all over the inside of the cavern, mining... with picks! It's just not natural and I'm sure it's because of the kaja'mite! None of my miners have come back out. I don't have many left! You can see my predicament, George.<The foreman lowers his voice.>These guys are nowhere near as good as my old group of jungle trolls. Ah, those were the days. Maybe you can escort my last miner here through the cavern and keep those monkeys off of him? We need that kaja'mite! 
Defeat the Guardian of the Elders.	Worthy of Passing	The four elemental spirits will help you speak with the land and uncover its plight, but first, I have one small task to ask of you. Join me, my pupil. Accompany this old pandaren to the western grove. 
Use a B.C. Eliminator to defeat 30 Oomlot Warriors.	Town-In-A-Box: Under Attack	George, you have to defend us! I had the eggheads deploy the town's cannon defenses, but it seems like there's an unlimited supply of these Oomlot warriors! Get your behind into one of those B.C. Eliminators and eliminate the pygmy threat to the town! 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at the Town-In-A-Box on the Lost Isles.	Oomlot Dealt With	George, you have to get back to the Town-In-A-Box and warn them about the goblin zombies up in the volcano's caldera! 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.	A Bazillion Macaroons?!	You're an extremely ambitious young goblin, George. Maybe a little too ambitious for your own good. I see a lot of myself in you when I was your age. I have a proposition. You might have noticed that Mount Kajaro is exploding thanks to your dragon. Everyone on Kezan is going to die! But, if you bring me a bazillion macaroons before my yacht leaves the island, I'll make sure that you're one of the lucky few to escape. If you want to live, you better hurry and figure out how to get me my moolah! 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.	Give Sassy the News	I'd celebrate with you, George, but it feels like that dragon did a number on ol' Mount Kajaro. I... uh... I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving the island! Anyways, you should probably head back to headquarters and let Sassy know that you won the footbomb title for us. I'm sure she'll also want to know about the dragon and Mount Kajaro. Good luck! 
Destroy 10 Naga Banners, replacing them with Bilgewater Cartel Banners.	Bilgewater Cartel Represent	Looks like the naga down there in the ruins are preparing to invade our Town-In-A-Box. I have lots of dead scouts here as proof. I don't know about you, but I'm not about to let them try. Let's get the jump on them! Could you lay the foundation for our new coastal holdings by replacing their banners with our own? That's some prime real estate down there! 
Press the Big Red Button to destroy the KTC Oil Platform.	Good-bye, Sweet Oil	There is single big, red button on the platform control console. Clearly if ever there were a button to cause massive explosions, that is it! 
Kill 10 gyreworms.	Fear of Boring	The gyreworms infest the rock, eating away at it until our home will one day collapse. For every one that is killed, twice as many burst forth to follow, but we must carry on the fight. They must be extinguished. Go to the Crumbling Depths and slaughter any worms that you can find. 
Punt 5 Children of Tortolla into water.	Punting Season	Baby turtles are sweet, even if they can be somewhat bitey.<Mylune holds up a bandaged finger.>But they're so slow with their tiny little legs, they can't escape the fire creatures who are attacking Hyjal!<Mylune claps her hands together.>PLEASE save them, George! Pick up the wee turtles and punt them into the water of the Ashen Lake. Don't worry about the kicking, they have hard shells. They also have hard teeth, so don't pick them up by the mouth. 
Kill 5 Charhounds or Ancient Charhounds.	The Dogs of War	Our forces are falling beneath an unleashed monstrosity - Charhounds from the molten depths. These dogs fear nothing and will not stop until their lust for blood is satisfied. Our forces are barely holding them back. Go join the defenders in the Ashen Fields or in the Molten Flow. Perhaps you can make a dent in their numbers. 
Snatch the flame from Master Shang Xi's palm, then burn the Edict of Temperance.	The Lesson of the Burning Scroll	Every wisdom has a time and place, and times are changing for those of us living here on Shen-zin Su. For this lesson, I would ask two things of you. For the first, I hold a flame in my hand. Gather your wits, and when you think you are ready, attempt to snatch the flame. Should you succeed, I want you to then climb to the top of this temple and burn the Edict of Temperance that you find there. 
Light your Unlit Challenger's Torch at the Brazier of Flickering Flame, then use it to light the 3 braziers near Master Li Fei.	The Challenger's Fires	You're strong of mind and strong of will, but you lack the skills to face me in combat. You must fight with your body, but in truth, it is your character that is being tested. Let us even the playing field. Take this torch, light it in the brazier next to me, and then use it to light the three unlit braziers around the pool. 
Retrieve the Gyrochoppa Keys.	Get to the Gyrochoppa!	The Alliance have stolen something of vital importance to the Horde. It is being held out on their ships. At the other end of the beach is a gyrochoppa. Our battlesworn will cover your approach. Go retrieve the keys to the flying machine from one of their operatives. Fly out to their flagship, the Vengeance Wake, and retrieve our precious cargo! 
Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at the Wild Overlook on the Lost Isles.	Farewell, For Now	Our destinies are forever intertwined. There are events taking place that are reshaping our world and ultimately will destroy it. We must put an end to them before it is too late. Know that you can always count on me, <brother/sister>! We will meet again on the larger island. May you find peace until then, George. 
Slay 8 Steamwheedle Sharks.	Shredder Shutdown	That no-good Trade Prince Gallywix somehow managed to stow the whole Steamwheedle Sharks footbomb team away on the yacht. I didn't even see any of them! Now he has them doing his dirty work here at the lumber yard. George, you're the <guy/gal> who won the championship for us back home on Kezan. You've got to get rid of them! 
You must kill Warden Silva in The Hole and return with his keys. The Hole is just southwest of Baradin Hold.	The Warden	We have almost finished clearing out the revolting prisoners in The Hole, but one last problem remains. The warden. Warden Silva is their master and they will do anything for him. If we take him out, we take them all out. Finish him off and bring me back his keys. We can use those keys to explore deeper into the cellblock and possibly gain access to the water supply here on the island. 
Find and kill First Lieutenant Connor at Forgotten Hill. You will find Forgotten Hill on the far west side of the island.	First Lieutenant Connor	The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in Ragefire Chasm. None of us could believe he ended up here on Tol Barad. Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale. I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours. 
Collect 4 Sticky Silk Glands from Darkwood Broodmother spiders in The Darkwood. The Darkwood forest is just west of here, across the bridge on the central island.	A Sticky Task	Finding supplies on the island has been difficult, to say the least. Fortunately, we have found a good supply of silk in The Darkwood, just west of here. The bad part of this story is that the silk comes from the glands on Broodmother spiders. I need you to gather 4 of these for me. That should be just enough to finish up this last set of shirts. 
Kill Ruk-ruk, the Fe-Feng Chief.	Do No Evil	George, I need you to understand that the way of the Huojin is not the way of violence. When fighting is needed, we will not hesitate, but when fighting is not needed, neither do we instigate. However, the direct solution is often cutting the head off the snake, as they say. The hozen have a leader instigating these attacks. If we remove Ruk-Ruk, we won't have to wipe the hozen out entirely. I know you are not of the Huojin, but are you with me in what must be done, George? 
Speak to Delora Lionheart at the Wreck of the Skyseeker.	Urgent News	I'm sure Aysa won't love this plan, but it's the only plan we've got. Would you mind being the bearer of bad news for me, George? She needs to know what we're doing so she can get everyone to safety. 
Collect 1 Kaja'Cola Zero-One.	Kaja'Cola Gives You IDEAS! (TM)	Assistant Greely is clearly bewildered and intimidated. How will she help you to find a way to rescue everyone in this condition? Maybe if she were to drink one of those Kaja'Cola Zero-One drinks you saw, she'd be able to have a bright idea? 
Obtain 4 Flame-Wreathed Hearts from Seething Firelords.	Relieving the Pain	The Arch Druid has an immense tolerance for pain. I've treated burn victims that spend twenty-two hours a day screaming in pain, and their burns weren't even half as bad as what Hamuul has suffered. Nevertheless, I can sense that he is in greater discomfort than normal today. Bring me the hearts of the large fire elementals to the southeast. I can use them to prepare a soothing salve for our patient. 
Commander Larmash has asked you to kill 14 villagers in Rustberg Village. Rustberg Village is just north of base camp, on the right side.	Not The Friendliest Town	Have you been up to Rustberg Village yet George? I would suggest you bring a sharpened blade if you are heading that direction. The folks in that town look alright but something suspicious is going on in there. Reports have been coming in that they are picking off our soldiers left and right. We have had just about enough of that, so I need you to head down there and do a little cleaning house for us. Take down as many as you can and report back when you are done. 
	LFGDungeons - Cataclysm - Raid Finder - Nth	 
Escort a Farson Hold Prisoner to safety. The hold is located on the northwestern tip of the island.	Walk A Mile In Their Shoes	We have sent at least 3 different recon groups to investigate Farson Hold in the last few weeks. Sadly, not one of them has returned back with any info. At this point, all we can hope is that they are being held alive as prisoners. I need you to infiltrate the keep and help get our soldiers back. This won't be easy George, but if anyone can help us, it's you. 
Use the powers of the Cyclone of the Elements to slay 50 Alliance Sailors. Once this is done, you will be flown to the Wild Overlook.	Warchief's Revenge	Brothers of Earth and Fire, hear me! Sisters of the Water and Air, heed my call! Azeroth stands on the brink, its existence near an end! Lend me your power as in times past with my ancient ancestors. Allow me to channel your will through this child of Kezan. Let us put an end to those who would keep us from healing the world! 
Plant 5 Smothervine Seeds in the Ash Piles in the Ashen Fields.	Aggressive Growth	Our warriors are doing everything they can to hold back the elementals, but their numbers are endless. We need to do something to slow down the assault. Find some suitable patches of dirt or ash out on the Ashen Fields to our north and plant these seeds. They will grow deadly vines that may slow down our enemies a bit. It's not much, but every bit helps. 
Collect 10 Living Obsidium from the Obsidium Punishers on Fireplume Peak.	The Bigger They Are	You're not going to take on fiery behemoths wearing THAT, are you? If you aren't wearing my obsidium crafted goods, you're going to burn right up! And even if you are, you can never have enough of the good stuff. Look <brother/sister>, I can craft you the best armor that gold can buy, but I need pure, unsmelted Living Obsidium first. The Obsidium Punishers on Fireplume Peak are literally made of the stuff. Go kill them and gather their pieces. 
Speak to Aysa Cloudsinger in the Singing Pools.	The Singing Pools	It is crucial that we bring all of the three remaining spirits back safely. I am too old to do this myself, and for all their strengths, both Aysa and Ji are single-minded in their ideals. You possess all the qualities of a hero, and a balance that they do not. It is you that must do this. Shu, the spirit of water is somewhere in the singing pools to the east. Find Aysa there and work with her to locate him. We are all depending on you. 
Kill 10 Virmen.	Rascals	I'll keep trying to find ways to wake this stubborn little guy up, but there is no shortage of trouble on the island it seems. The crops to the south are infested with virmen, rabbit-like thieves and pillagers. Rascals! They breed faster than we can kill them! I have the perfect solution for such a situation: kill them faster! With you here, George, that shouldn't be a problem. 
Burn 5 Defaced Scroll of Wisdom.	Rewritten Wisdoms	George, we must help Elder Shaopai. There are few more deserving of our kindness. On the way here, you surely noticed the scrolls of wisdom hanging in the grotto to the south. The hozen have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely. Do not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that. 
Slay Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.	Three Little Pygmies	Look, I think it's great that we're destroying all of these zombies, even though they're our friends and family. But don't you think we should be taking care of the pygmies that are creating them as well? At the three Oostan villages, Nord, Sor, and Ost, there are witch doctors: Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch. Maybe you could take care of them? I don't want to be turned into a zombie! 
Speak with Slinky Sharpshiv at Sky Falls on the Lost Isles.	Let's Ride	Bastia will make sure that you get to where you need to go, goblin. 
Look for clues in the admiral's cabin of the Alliance Gunship.	The Admiral's Cabin	It's possible we'll find further clues inside the admiral's cabin. You will find it directly below us. See if there are any survivors or information that will lead us closer to the World Pillar fragment. Be careful, George. Whoever got the crew might still be out there. 
Kill Gorgonite.	Rock Bottom	I've one more favor to ask, fleshling. There is a basilisk, much larger and much older than the rest. Though we normally fear nothing from their kind, this one has become so potent as to petrify some of my sons. This shall not be abided. Find Gorgonite to the east and slay him. He has lived much longer than necessary. 
Retrieve a Stonework Mallet.	Fragile Values	It is now time to draw the Broodmother's attention. To do so, we will need a mallet that the troggs use when making offerings to her. Seek out the Stone Trogg Beast Tamers that are attempting to tame basilisks in the southern portions of the Pale Roost. You will find a mallet on one of their corpses. 
Use the Stormstone at the Twilight Gate and Elemental Gate in Abyssion's Lair.	Block the Gates	If we're to have a shot against Abyssion, we must make sure he receives no aid from reinforcements. You will find two gateways in his lair to the east. Use this stormstone to disrupt their operation. If everything goes as planned, we'll be able to tackle Abyssion without him being able to receive much assistance. 
You have been asked to kill Problim, a giant ettin that roams the paths of Tol Barad.	A Huge Problem	We finally capture this godforsaken rock and then we find out that there is a huge ettin roaming around, taking out our sentry patrols! George, I need you to round up a few friends and take that ettin down. We can't have a beast like that roaming around, wreaking havoc. Stay alert, reports from the front say that he is carrying a huge tree as a weapon, and he is not afraid to use it. 
Detonate the Solar Core.	Solar Core Destruction	The fight has taken us to Fandral's doorstep. His druids are channeling energies of the Firelands into a vessel called the Solar Core. Should this vessel detonate on Azeroth, none of us will have a home to return to. We need to strike at the Solar Core now, while it is still vulnerable. You can find the infernal device to the northeast. 
Sergeant Gray has asked you to recover 15 pieces of Shipyard Lumber from the Wellson Shipyard. The lumber can be recovered from the ghosts in the shipyard or found lying around the premises. The shipyard can be found northwest of here, on the coast.	Watch Out For Splinters!	Have you been over to the Wellson Shipyard yet, George? Best to stay away from there unless you have a good reason to venture in. Unfortunately, that is exactly what I need you to do. You see, we have been short on supplies ever since we recaptured the island. That ghost ridden shipyard is overflowing with lumber but every time we send an escort to recover the lumber, they never make it back. Can you help us out? 
Recover the Dai-Lo Recess Mallet at the Ki-Han Brewery.	Missing Mallet	George, I've got it! It's simple really. Let's make a ruckus so loud that there's no way he can sleep through it. Why look at that, a conveniently placed gong! Makes me think this may just be how they've awoken him in the past. We just need the matching mallet to get it ringing as loud as possible. The village leader tells me the mallet is over at the Ki-Han Brewery on the river, to the southwest. It's not far. Mind picking it up for me while I give the village some fair warning? 
Speak with Megs Dreadshredder at the western entrance to the Ruins of Vashj'elan on the Lost Isles.	Invasion Imminent!	Your work here is done for now, but there's no rest for the wicked, eh? You remember Megs Dreadshredder, our old marketing rep? She's taken some others over the hills to the southeast, just past the Raptor Rise. If you follow the path east out of town and follow it south at the fork, you can't miss her. Apparently there's some trouble or other brewing with the snake-men at the ruins on the shore. Go see if you can't sort it all out, would you? 
Place the trapped meat in the western end of the Alabaster Shelf.	Testing the Trap	You must set the trap for the matriarch now. Go to the western end of the Alabaster Shelf and place the trapped basilisk meat in the center of the feeding grounds. 
Kill 3 Druids of the Flame.	Traitors Return	The Druids of the Flame assault our front line, George. These vile creatures have turned their backs on Elune's teachings and worship instead the Fire Lord, Ragnaros. Twisted by his insane power, they desire nothing more than to bury us in ash. We must counter their attack immediately! 
Speak to Ayla Shadowstorm at Malfurion's Breach.	Nourishing Waters	I have dispatched the sacred moonwell waters to Malfurion's Breach, as you requested. Ayla is well trained in tending to them. You should return to her and see the boons she weaves for you there. 
Survive the Rocket Sling shot across the Dire Strait.	Up, Up & Away!	While you were rescuing the Warchief and saving us all from the Alliance, Foreman Dampwick built this rocket sling to shoot us over the shark-infested strait to the bigger island. Luckily for us, the foreman managed to salvage a Town-In-A-Box from the shipwreck. Once you get it set up, we'll have a town of our own. I can't wait to sleep in a bed again! Dampwick's down there at the Landing Site, waiting for you. Why don't you take the next rocket over? 
Speak to Master Shang Xi.	Much to Learn	Freshly arrived for your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi. 
Speak with Coach Crosscheck at the Lost Peak on the Lost Isles.	Up the Volcano	A whole bunch of our people headed up to the top of the volcano to mount a counter-offensive. There's something horrible brewing up there on the Lost Peak. They're waiting for you before they make any moves against the pygmies. Those evil little things turned a lot of us into zombies! George, save us! 
Collect 6 Replacement Parts.	The Replacements	My guys are all on the injured roster! Our shredders are all kaput! The ref is about to call the game! It's down to the wire and I need you, George!!!Let's get one of these shredders in working condition. There are replacement parts all over Bilgewater Port. Any green-blooded Kezanian will gladly let you have them if there's a chance that the Buccaneers will win. We'll show those no-good Steamwheedle Sharks how to play footbomb! 
Speak with Megs Dreadshredder at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.	Megs in Marketing	Boss, while you were down at the mines, Megs Dreadshredder in marketing was asking for you. Something about your new ride? She's right outside the building to the left. 
You have been instructed to kill 12 Alliance Infantry on Tol Barad. You can find the holdouts in The Slagworks, Warden's Vigil and the Ironclad Garrison, here on Tol Barad.	The Leftovers	We fought hard to capture this island, Human. We cleared out most of the Alliance filth but I can still smell their foul stench in the air. I need you to investigate the slagworks, warden's vigil and the ironclad garrison. Kill any Alliance that you find. You know what they say, the only good Alliance is a dead Alliance! 
Speak to Theresa Barkskin in the Igneous Depths.	Into the Fiery Depths	One of our druids moved ahead into the Igneous Depths in pursuit of a Druid of the Flame. Go to her. Help her. 
Inform Aggra at the Horde Base Camp on the Lost Isles of all that has transpired.	Back to Aggra	Return to the Horde Base Camp and let Aggra know that we still live, George. Tell her that I am moving on to the Wild Overlook and that we will all meet up on the northwest side of the island. I expect to see you there. We will track down the Alliance and slay them to the last! 
Rescue 6 Goblin Survivors.	Goblin Escape Pods	George, I'm sorry, I thought you were dead! This is just crazy. We sailed into a fight between the Alliance and Horde! You know, our brothers and sisters still need to be rescued.<He points out all of the escape pods in the water around you.>I think I'm going to sit here a while longer and catch my breath. Can you swim around and let them out? Take my pair of thermohydratic flippers so you can get around faster. Let Sassy know that I'll swim in shortly. 
Speak to Makael Bay in the Pei-Wu Forest.	Wrecking the Wreck	To dislodge the alliance ship, we need to find our engineer. He parted ways with us when we were escaping the wreckage. You should be able to find him somewhere in the western forest. Tell him Korga sent you and he'll get in line to help. 
	Bleed the Bloodshaper	The Twilight's Hammer are wielding foul magic here, George. They animate and energize the remains of Deathwing's blood, so that instead of drying out and disappearing it thrives and becomes more abundant. Take out one of the bloodshapers, see if they have any clues as to where we can find this ""forgemaster."" 
Slay 5 Fungal Monstrosities.	Fungal Monstrosities	Grab yourself a war guardian, and destroy those fungal monstrosities while you're out there. 
Speak with Hydrius at the Abyssal Breach in the Abyssal Depths of Vashj'ir.	Into Coaxing Tides	Go'el must be in the plane of water... the Abyssal Maw itself! I shudder to imagine what fate awaits him there. Find the elemental, Hydrius, near the Abyssal Breach. He knows of Go'el and is sympathetic to our fight against Ragnaros. If anyone can help you there, it's him. I will meet you beneath the tides of Vashj'ir, Human... 
Kill 5 Restless Soldiers at the Restless Front. You can find the front on the west side of the island, just before Forgotten Hill.	Finish The Job	We have been trying to collect useful scraps from the front all week. Every time we gather a batch to bring back to camp, we get assaulted by the restless soldiers in the area. Can you head over there and clear them out? 
	LFGDungeons - Cataclysm - Raid Finder - 1st	 
	Blackrock Caverns Reward Quest	 
Recover the Biggest Egg Ever.	The Biggest Egg Ever	Bamm Megabomb? Who does he think he is? His spiny raptor eggs are no match for what we are about to recover! As you well know, each Town-In-A-Box is equipped with a micro mechachicken for just such a dietary emergency. Luckily for us, my keen intellect was able to deduce the location that our prodigious, pre-programmed poultry ran off to. Head north to the Scorched Gully. But beware, its circuit boards are fried and I imagine it's not so micro any longer! 
Slay Yngwie.	Send a Message	The Oomlot leader, Yngwie, is too powerful to be left alive. He's barking nonsense from the raised west side of the village, across the rope bridge. Go up there and get him before he sends the rest of the village against us. Piece of cake! 
Use the Bootzooka to slay Volcanoth.	Volcanoth!	It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but the Bootzooka, patent-pending, is ready for use! These no-good pygmies have been feeding our people to their ""god"", Volcanoth, and they're about to unleash it on our town! You have to get into the cave and kill that thing before it's too late! 
Collect 8 Shredder Spare Parts.	The Ultimate Footbomb Uniform	Look, kid, I'm here to see to it that you've got a fighting chance at the end game. Thrall's going to need your help in the fight against the Trade Prince. Greely, Hobart, and I have a plan to put together the ultimate footbomb uniform for you so that you can win the game, but I'm going to need some things first. Lucky for us, this lumber yard is sick with spare shredder parts. Now get out there and give me 110%! 
Deliver Sassy's Incentive to Foreman Dampwick at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.	Taking Care of Business	With all of the troubles down in the Kaja'mine, Foreman Dampwick's been going crazy trying to find you. He said something about some 'defiant trolls'. The kaja'mite that our trolls are mining is critical ingredient in Kaja'Cola. That bubbly stuff is making us a fortune, and it's going to get you a promotion to Trade <Prince/Princess>!But first, we have to get production flowing again. You'll find the foreman to the east. Here, give him this as an incentive to get his act together. 
Find Felsen the Enduring and follow his instruction towards the entrance to the Crumbling Depths.	Violent Gale	There is a task that I can set before you. It is a dangerous task. Completing it will help impress the more stubborn Stone Lords. To the northwest is the Scoured Reach. Severe winds batter the rock and hide the true living threat underneath. Within the Scoured Reach are Gyreworms. They devour rock and move through it as if it were water. They do the same thing to our rocky skin. Find Felsen the Enduring. Have him direct you to the Crumbling Depths. I will speak to you once you get that far. 
Kill 12 Jaspertip rockflayers.	Intervention	The flayers have gone crazy with hunger. Their digging was once tempered and moderate. Now their hunger cannot be quenched. They grow murderously violent. The flayers have turned on my sons. They overwhelm them. Kill them. It must stop. Kill the flayers. They serve no purpose to the earth. Their passing will not be missed. Save my sons. Slaughter any flayers you find. 
Obtain 100 Flamewaker Scales.	Releasing the Pressure	Having been burned so badly, Arch Druid Hamuul is suffering from edema - swelling of the body's tissues. It takes a great deal of his attendants' effort to keep his swelling down enough for him to breathe. Normally, to reduce this swelling, we make cuts in his flesh, but he is weak, George. I cannot cut him today. I need your help. Flamewaker scales will aid with the swelling, but you need a lot of them. 
Retrieve 12 Rusty Rifles from Farson Hold on the north side of Tol Barad Peninsula.	Leave No Weapon Behind	Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock. Every time we hold off another Alliance attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones. Reports have come in that Keep Lord Farson on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use. Can you head down there and check it out? Be careful George, Farson's followers will do anything to protect him. 
You need to recover 4 Stacks of Cannonballs from Largo's Overlook for Sergeant Gray. You can find Largo's Overlook just northeast of the base camp.	Cannonball!	Largo and his minions have been stealing our supplies ever since we setup camp here. It's frustrating to say the least. We have heard reports that he is stockpiling cannonballs in the towers overlooking the water up on his overlook. Can you head up there and try to recover some of them for us? George, don't forget to keep a watch out for horde too. 
Kill 8 Fe-Feng attackers.	The Way of the Huojin	We call those vicious monkeys swinging into town hozen. They keep to themselves normally, but they know something bad is coming, so they're here to steal our supplies. In situations like this, the clear answer is the only answer. These monkeys will leave when we force them to leave! To not defend our town and those we love would be the only true crime. Thus is the way of the Huojin. 
Free 5 Goblin Captives.	Free the Captives	They've got a bunch of our people in there. I know that they're doing strange rituals to them. It looks like they're sucking the life force right out of them! You have to go into the village and free the captives before it's too late! 
Crack the vault at the First Bank of Kezan to retrieve your Personal Riches.	The Great Bank Heist	All of your assets have been frozen and the First Bank of Kezan is out of business! You need an awful lot of moolah, boss. I think you're going to have to go break your own money out of the bank! The different widgets in your Goblin All-In-1-Der belt should be enough to crack the vault. I just hope that you've been saving for a rainy day like I always told you to do. You might have noticed... it's raining hot liquid magma!!! 
Deliver the Six-Pack of Kaja'Cola to Sassy Hardwrench at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.	Kaja'Cola	Sassy's been riding me to supply some Kaja'cola for the party that's being thrown in your honor later today. Oops, was it supposed to be a surprise? You didn't hear it from me! Anywho, with production down these last few days, this is all that I managed to get made. Would you take it to her? 
Reactivate 5 Deactivated War Constructs.	Reactivate the Constructs	We sent a number of our war constructs north into Needlerock Slag, but none of them ever returned. We know that the stone trogg mystics have done something to them. What we're concerned about is that the mystics will control and turn them against us, like they have with the fungal giants. George, go into the stone trogg town and reactivate the constructs. 
Defeat 8 Twilight or Dragonkin units at Abyssion's Lair.	Abyssion's Minions	If it's the dragon that's got the fragment, we're going to need to draw his attention back to his den. Go to Abyssion's Lair just east of here and defeat his underlings. That should get him to show up with the World Pillar fragment sooner or later. 
	Cataclysm 84-85	 
Speak to Ji at the Dai-Lo Farmstead. A cart is waiting near the road to take you there.	The Source of Our Livelihood	We have done as Master Shang asked of us. I will return to the temple to inform the master of our progress. You should continue south on the road to the farmlands to seek out Wugou, the spirit of earth. Ji awaits you at the Dai-Lo Farmstead, and he'll surely need your help. I must warn you, Ji can be reckless in his directness. Remember well the things I have taught you: discipline and patience. 
Using your KTC Snapflash, capture images at the bouncing cameras of the three cave paintings and the pygmy altar.	Capturing the Unknown	Heya, George, there are strange cave paintings and other artifacts all over the cavern. Do you think you could use your belt-mounted KTC Snapflash camera to capture images at the designated spots? Also, snap a pic of the altar in the back of the cavern. I'm sure that Sassy will want the intel. 
Use your Hot Rod to run over 12 Hired Looters, collecting 12 Stolen Loots in the process.	Robbing Hoods	We're all going to die!!!<You slap Megs to calm her down.>Sorry about that, <Mr./Ms.> George. Okay, we need to find a way to get a lot of moolah quickly. There are reports of the Trade Prince sending hired looters into the streets. You could take the hot rod out there and run them down, snatching the loot that they've illegally stolen. There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, right? 
Return to Diamant at Lorthuna's Gate with the Painite Chunk.	A Rock Amongst Many	<The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of Diamant speaks as if from the stone itself.>You've done as I've asked. Turn back and escape the cave in one piece. Don't forget the gemstone. 
You have been instructed to kill 10 prisoners of any type in The Hole, just southwest of Baradin Hold.	Prison Revolt	We have the island, now we need to put the resources here to work. We found an abandoned cellblock just southwest of here and we need you to go check it out George. Reports have come back that it is overrun with prisoners that have been stuck down there for years. Do whatever you need to do to clear that place out. Report back to me when you are done. 
You must steal 22 Rustberg Seabass from Rustberg Village. The fish can be found on string stands at the docks, round back of the village. Rustberg Village is due north of base camp, on the right side.	Teach A Man To Fish.... Or Steal	Rustberg Village. That place is a curse and a blessing for us, George. I have no clue where bandits learned to fish as well as they do but I have no time to worry about that now. I need you to head down there and steal as many of their fish reserves as possible. We have been living off scraps since we retook the island and this is our best chance at some solid food reserves. Keep an eye out for stealthers up there, reports have told us they are prevalent inside the village walls. 
Speak to Ji Firepaw in Wu-Song Village.	Ji of the Huojin	Another of my most talented students is awaiting you in Wu-Song Village to the northwest. He is of a different mind than Aysa, but in their differences, they bring balance to each other. Ji Firepaw will instruct you on gathering the offerings for the spirit of fire. Trust in his wisdom.

Water walk into 5 of Shu's Water Spouts.	A New Friend	He wants you to play with him. Go for it! 
Gather 12 Abandoned Stone Blocks.	Stronger Than Stone	Gather me stone blocks from the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the south. You have seen my strength twice, yet I still spy doubt within your eyes. It will not last. 
	Don't Go Into the Light!	 
Collect the heads of Commander Arrington, Darkblade Cyn, and Alexi Silenthowl.	The Heads of the SI:7	These orcs were murdered in cold-blood by the Alliance down on the coast. We did nothing to provoke them. Their deaths should not be in vain, George. Will you bring them justice?<Aggra appears as if she can barely contain her rage.>There are three SI:7 leaders down there along the beach. Bring me each of their heads. 
Kill 8 Cinderweb Spinners or Cinderweb Creepers.	Pyrorachnophobia	We've fought hard to secure this area, but our foothold is tenuous. Our scouts report that the area around us is teeming with vicious fire spiders. They are the spawn of the vicious brood widow, Beth'tilac. Help us hold our line by clearing the area of Cinderweb Spinners or Cinderweb Creepers. It will drive her mad to see her children slain. 
Reignite Huo, the spirit of fire.	Huo, the Spirit of Fire	You are worthy of passing, Mechanic. Huo, the spirit of fire rests in the chamber beyond. Let him feast upon the kindling you've gathered, and use the wind to fan his flames. Doing so should endear you to him. Once he is ignited, if he is willing, lead him to the Temple of Five Dawns, the building standing high in the center of the island. 
	Well of Eternity Reward Quest	 
Defeat 8 Deepscale Tormentors.	From Bad to Worse	After their ship crashed, evil creatures swept up from the sea to pick through the wreckage. Our aid may seem but a drop in the pond at the thought of the misfortune they've faced today. Defeat their tormentors. These people desperately need our help. 
Locate the precious cargo below deck on the Alliance ship, Vengeance Wake, off the shore of the Lost Isles.	Precious Cargo	They said that their ""precious cargo"", whatever that is, is being held out on the Alliance ship, the Vengeance Wake. There's only one thing to do... fly this thing out there and retrieve it! 
Obtain Maldy's Falcon, The Goblin Lisa, and The Ultimate Bomb.	Waltz Right In	There's only one way we're going to get a bazillion macaroons: stealing from the rich! That slime, the Trade Prince, has stolen all kinds of antiques and expensive art. It's time to take them back and give them to the needy... mainly us! Hobart left behind a cap he was working on. It's a disguise that'll make you look like one of Gallywix's mooks. All you have to do is waltz right in to his Villa to the west and 'procure' the items. Just watch out for his pigs who can smell through the disguise! 
Obtain the Earthinator's Cudgel.	Troggzor the Earthinator	You have to put an end to this now! Go back northwest onto the front and kill their battle leader, Troggzor the Earthinator. Bring me his cudgel as proof. 
Obtain 7 Blueroot Vines.	Supplies for the Other Side	One of the biggest dangers that our druids face when fighting within the Firelands is simple dehydration. Our proveditors spend a significant amount of time preparing canteens for the troops on the other side. We do have other methods, however. In the greener thickets to the east, you should still find some blueroot vines which have not yet burned. These plants hold a tremendous amount of water in their roots - and also provide some energy for the weary soldier. 
Free 8 victims out of Cinderweb Cocoons.	Wicked Webs	Some of our scouts have not reported back for duty. We fear they have succumbed to the deadly spiders in the vicinity. Hope may not be lost, however. The spiders often wrap up their live prey in cocoons for later consumption. Go search the pillars to the north for cocooned victims. You may yet be able to save some of our brethren. 
Retrieve a Fire Hawk Egg from the top of Fireplume Peak.	Peaked Interest	These fire hawks are beings of fire, but they exhibit much of the same behavior that we've seen in birds back home. It makes me wonder from where they originate. Back to the point - I think we might be able to train them. Domesticate them if you will. Use them against our enemies. I'd like you to retrieve one of their eggs from the top of Fireplume Peak. If you can bring it back to me safely, I will see to the rest. 
	Darren's Bombing Run of Awesomeness	 
Retrieve 8 Paint Soaked Brushes.	Tools of the Enemy	The hozen have stolen our brushes and are painting over our scrolls of wisdom with their own wisdoms, if you can call them that. If you're here to help, stop them and bring our brushes back before they can do more harm. 
Kill 8 Darkened Horrors or Darkened Terrors.	Evil from the Seas	I do not know what this evil is that is infesting the forest, George, but I know exactly how to deal with it. So do you, I think. 
Collect 5 Fire Glands.	Children of a Turtle God	Volcanoth is the turtle god in the cave that these primitives worship. It's not really a god.<Hobart rolls his eyes.>But it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the one functioning boot we have left. I think that the age-old motto of ""fight fire with fire"" applies here. Plus, I like fire! Let's get some fire glands from Volcanoth's children. That should give me time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting. 
Destroy 5 Deepstone Elementals.	The Earth Claims All	We're in the plane of earth, George. Everything is absorbed by the land eventually. The Storm's Fury will soon be turned to dust and we won't be able to gain any insight from its remains. Go and destroy the elementals that are dismantling the ship. We're only delaying the inevitable, but we need to buy ourselves some time if we're to track down all the pieces of the World Pillar. 
Collect 6 Catapult Parts.	Fixer Upper	<Clay sneers at you and makes a sound much like two stones rubbing against each other.>They've smashed all of our catapults. I've been trying to get this one working, but no luck so far. Maybe you'd like to make yourself useful. Head out onto the front and grab me any spare parts you come across. You think you can handle that, flesh bag? 
Speak with Aggra on the Staidridge in Deepholm to secure passage to the Firelands.	Into Unrelenting Flame	We must travel now to the Firelands. Within that realm, Go'el's burning spirit could become as terrible as Ragnaros himself! Prepare yourself, for we will be alone in a hostile world. Speak with me when you are ready... and may the ancestors protect us! 
Use the Fang of the Wolf to summon and defeat Lylagar.	The Call of the Pack	<Matoclaw continues:>The easternmost portal of flame is the domain of Lylagar. Stand before the portal, deliver a challenging howl, and then force the fiery beast to submit. 
Collect 6 Stuff Tails for the Quest Wizard.	Collect Things	The Quest Wizard demands Stuff Tails! Go now and fetch them. 
Cross the ropes and speak to Aysa Cloudsinger on Morning Breeze Lake.	Balanced Perspective	Aysa has been meditating on the lake since we've arrived, all her thoughts focused on Dafeng. I don't know what she hopes to discover out there, but she's no fool, and Master Shang Xi has entrusted this task with her. You will need to cross the ropes leading from the end of the dock to reach her. It shall test your balance, but I think you're up to the task, George. 
Speak with Scout Brax on the path down the cliffs north of the Savage Glen on the Lost Isles.	To the Cliffs	I sent Scout Brax forward along the road to the cliffs overlooking the beach to the west. I am going to put you onto Bastia. Travel down the path and let Brax know that we are going to take a different route. We'll see you at the attack on the Alliance beachhead! 
Speak with Izzy at Oomlot Village on the Lost Isles.	Oomlot Village	The pygmies took most of our people back to their village. Who knows what evil they're up to? George, you have to go up there and free all of the captives before the pygmies work their voodoo on them! Izzy's already up near Oomlot Village to the southeast. She'll give you the heads-up on what's going down. Your pygmy helmet looks like it's in bad shape, but it should last long enough for you to get there. I hope. 
Slay any 12 stone troggs on the Fractured Front.	Shatter Them!	I want you to go out there and I want you to finish them. Berserkers, Earthrenders, Deathriders... I don't care! I want those stone troggs shattered! 
Speak to Merchant Lorvo by Fu's Pond.	Aysa of the Tushui	In such a short time, you've shown me that you have the potential to be a great Mechanic. The training grounds are behind you, but now you must prove yourself by facing a far greater challenge, one that none of my students have accomplished. I want you to return Huo, the spirit of fire, to the Temple of Five Dawns. My two other most gifted students will help you in this task. The first is Aysa Cloudsinger. Seek her out at the pool to the west. 
Speak to Jasper Fel at Admiral Taylor's Garrison.	Old Friends	Admiral Taylor was ordered to establish a garrison inland while we erected yours in Shadowmoon Valley. He settled just a short ways north of here. The two of us could go there and borrow some supplies to tide us over before our next shipment. What do you say, commander? I'm sure the admiral will be thrilled to see you again. 
Beat down Bruno Flameretardant, Frankie Gearslipper, Jack the Hammer, and Sudsy Magee.	Do it Yourself	We need to send a message to several deadbeats. Of course, they're hiding out in Drudgetown, the scum. I know how you hate going into the slums, boss-<man/lady>, but what can we do?<Sassy rifles through some paperwork.>I have all of the names right here. Might I suggest a little 'personal visit'? A couple of strategic beatdowns will send a message to the other debtors AND your competition. George is not a goblin to be trifled with! 
	The Keys to the Hot Rod	 
Retrieve a Bag of Verlok Miracle-Grow from the Verloks upon the Crimson Expanse.	Through Persistence	The troggs did not disperse after you killed Glop. His servants recovered the growth agent that was left behind and continue to sow the seeds of corruption across the Crimson Expanse. Hunt them down and recover any of the remaining Verlock Miracle-Grow that you find. It must be disposed of. 
Release the spirits of 6 tortured souls at Forgotten Hill. Souls can be channeled by touching your hands directly to the gravestones. Forgotten Hill is due west of here, past The Restless Front.	The Forgotten	Many soldiers died on this island George. It is only fair that we pay our respects to them in any way that we can. I need you to travel to Forgotten Hill, due west of here and release our brothers in arms' tortured souls away from this place. Do be careful over there, reports of undead have been ongoing in the area. 
	Stonecore Reward Quest	 
Feed 10 Bomb-Throwing Monkeys by tossing Nitro-Potassium Bananas to them.	Monkey Business	We've got major problems with the monkeys in the jungle to the east. They've stolen all of our explosives, and now they're going around throwing them. Sometimes at us! I had Fizz Lighter take some of his nitro and put it in these bananas. No monkey can resist a bunch of bananas! All you have to do is go out there and feed them. 
Slay 6 Teraptor Hatchlings.	It's Our Problem Now	Looks like those monkeys will steal anything! Those thieving little monsters have driven the teraptor matriarch into a frenzy by stealing her eggs. Worse yet, the eggs have started to hatch! We've got hungry teraptor hatchlings running around all over the place, looking to make a quick meal out of us! We didn't start this, but it's our problem now. You'll have to head into the jungle and kill those hungry teraptor hatchlings before they kill us all. 
Shoot down 10 Gnomeregan Stealth Fighters.	The Pride of Kezan	This is ridiculous! Those gnomes just don't know when to stop! Goblin pride is on the line here! George, you gotta jump into the Pride of Kezan and show them what's what! Let me know when you're ready! 
Speak with Trade Prince Gallywix upstairs at the KTC Headquarters main building on Kezan.	The Uninvited Guest	While you were dealing with the pirates, I noticed the Trade Prince slip upstairs. He's up on the balcony at the top of the stairs. George, I think he's the one that sent the pirates.<Sassy cringes.>You'd better get up there A.S.A.P.! You wouldn't want to keep him waiting. 
Report to Captain Saynna Stormrunner at Ragnaros' Reach.	A Lieutenant of Flame	Captain Saynna has requested your presence at Ragnaros' Reach. A Lieutenant of Flame has shown himself and she thinks you are our greatest chance at striking against him. Make your way there as soon as you're able. 
Kill 12 Pirate Party Crashers in order to save your career.	Pirate Party Crashers	Oh my gosh! Pirates! George, there are Southsea pirates crashing your party! You have to get in there and do something about this or your career, and any chance of you being the next Trade <Prince/Princess>, is going to be ruined! 
Kill 8 Fungal Behemoths.	Soft Rock	The corruption of the Crimson Expanse has not subsided. Destroy the Fungal Behemoths that shower their filth upon our realm. If they continue to rise, we will continue to destroy them. 
	LFGDungeons - Cataclysm - Dungeon Normal 1st	 
Overload the Defective Generator, Activate the Leaky Stove, Drop a Cigar on the Flammable Bed, and use the Gasbot to set KTC Headquarters ablaze!	447	We're close, but we still don't have enough macaroons. But, I've got a plan: we're going to collect on the headquarters insurance policy! Hope you don't mind, but I filled the place with the leftover fireworks from your party. All you have to do is go in there and sabotage things. Might I suggest the faulty generator, the leaky stove, and the flammable bed? Then, come back outside and use the control panel to send in the gasbot. It's a foolproof plan! 
Slay 5 Needlerock Mystics.	Mystic Masters	The Needlerock mystics have taken control of the fungal giants that have sprouted in their chasm, down below. Now they seek to control our war constructs. Go north into Needlerock Slag and do something about it! Isn't that what you're here for? 
You must kill Archmage Galus and return with his Staff from the Cursed Depths, just east of Baradin Hold.	The Imprisoned Archmage	We have been trying to clear out the Cursed Depths cellblock since we landed on Tol Barad. It seems that everytime we get close, that archmage shows up and pushes us back. Now that we have claimed the island, it's time we take another shot. Head down there and bring me back his staff as proof that you have finished the job. 
Obtain 6 small piles of Houndbone Ash.	Hounds of Shannox	On the Firelands' largest island, our troops have been having trouble against Shannox, the flamewaker hunter. Not only does he have impeccable aim, but he keeps trained hounds that give our troops no end of trouble. Tholo, in all his wisdom, thinks it would be a good idea to study the biology of these hounds. I, of course, agree with Tholo. You will find several hounds in the Molten Flow, beneath the Furnace. We will need their ashes to study. 
	Blackrock Caverns Bonus Reward	 
Rescue the Cart Driver.	The Missing Driver	My driver went running off after the sprites just after they attacked. I don't think they'll really do him any harm, but I need him back to help me clean up the mess by the cart. He chased them off towards the cliffs to the north. If you head that direction, you should find him quickly. 
Attempt to figure out why the WMO spawned objective's minimap golden dot will not appear when its spawn tracking is set to Unit instead of Objective.	Spawn Tracking Unit-Specified World Effect in a WMO Bug	There seems to be a bug when you setup a world effect containing a gold dot on the minimap through Spawn Tracking that is set to Unit, rather than Objective. It seems to only happen with spawns inside WMOs. Might also be happening with setting it to Object as well. If the Spawn Tracking on the World Effect is set to Objective, everything's fine. However, if it is set to Unit, the golden dot will not show up on the minimap. 
Kill 20 hozen in Fe-Feng Village.	The Direct Solution	Alright George, this is the second time we've had to deal with ravaging hozen. I think it's time we take care of this problem the Huojin way. No more patience. No more mediation. We go to the source. We're going into the hozen village to the north and we're punishing those smelly troublemakers. I've been looking forward to a chance to fight by your side again, George. 
Retrieve 10 Obsidium Meteorites.	Living Obsidium	Have you seen those fireballs falling out of the sky? I saw one crash in the fields to the north, and the rock that landed was made of pure Living Obsidium! I can use the material to craft ultra-sturdy heat proof armor and weapons for our troops. Can you bring me a lode? Go to the Magma Springs and touch one of the magnetic stones. Just watch where you're standing when the rain of fire hits, and gather up the rocks before they crumble from the impact. 
You have been asked to kill Keep Lord Farson at the Farson Hold. Farson Hold can be found on the north side of the island.	Claiming The Keep	Have you seen the keep on the north side of the island, George? That is where Keep Lord Farson runs his operation from. Farson has a small group of dedicated followers and they have been giving us trouble since we got here. We sent a small group to investigate and they reported back on his exact position within the keep. Can you finish him off for us? 
Gather 5 Dry Dogwood Roots.	Kindling the Fire	Now that that's done with, let's get to it then! Huo, the spirit of fire, hungers for dry dogwood root kindling. It grows among the trees south of the village. It should be easy enough for you to gather some. 
	Grim Batol Reward Quest	 
Get Omar some cloth	Craig's Test Quest Again!	An honorable person gives me cloth 
Speak with Foreman Dampwick outside of the Kaja'mite Cavern on the Lost Isles.	Help Wanted	Great news! Foreman Dampwick has uncovered a cave full of kaja'mite on the island! What are the odds? Of course, there's a downside. He took some of the survivors with him to help mine the ore, but none of them have made it out. Crazy as it sounds, the foreman said that there are monkeys in the cave... with mining picks! They're mining the kaja'mite! How is that even possible? Can you head southeast to the cavern? The foreman is standing just outside the entrance. 
Adjust the attitudes of 8 Defiant Trolls.	Good Help is Hard to Find	I've failed! I tried to meet our Kaja'Cola quotas, but you know troll slaves these days. Good help is hard to find! I think your personal touch is called for. A shock from the battery on your Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt should do the trick. Adjust their attitudes and the rest will fall in line. Kaja'Cola production must continue or the Trade Prince will have all of our heads! 
You have been asked to recover 12 Cellblock Rations from The Hole, just southwest of Baradin Hold.	Food From Below	Supplies are running low here in camp, George. We have recently learned that the cellblock just southwest of here has a number of rations remaining from years of use. We need you to gather as many of those as you can and bring them back to camp. One more thing, the entire cellblock is overrun with prisoners so be careful. 
	Throne of the Tides Reward Quest	 
	Halls of Origination Bonus Rewards	 
Use the What's It to see a Spell Visual play through the magic of Spawn Tracking tech.	Spawn Tracking & Spell Visuals: Do They Work?	Here's some text. 
Ring the gong.	Raucous Rousing	You ready for this, George? I'm thinking maybe we should have looked for something to cover our ears, but it's a bit late for that now. Just remember that the intense ringing you'll be hearing for the next few hours is the ringing sound of victory! The honor's all yours, George. Ring the gong whenever you're ready! 
Recover 8 Stolen Firework Bundles.	Monkey Advisory Warning	The monkeys have been stealing from the village during their attacks. We should be fine without some of the extra food stores, but the idea of monkeys with fireworks... I'm a little bit concerned. Not to mention, who knows when some fireworks will come in handy? Help me recover the stolen fireworks from their village, George? 
Gather 5 Spiny Raptor Eggs.	Trading Up	Hobart thinks he's going to feed us on those tiny clucker eggs? Bah! We're going to get some real eggs! I've already set up some traps on the Raptor Rise up the path to the east. Take this bunch of wild clucker eggs and lay them in the traps. The spiny raptors will go right after the clucker eggs, and then you'll get to trade up to their larger eggs. Genius! 
Speak with Hobart Grapplehammer at the Town-In-A-Box on the Lost Isles.	Hobart Needs You	Heya, boss, Hobart Grapplehammer's wants to speak with you. He says it's a matter of some urgency. 
Destroy 10 Doomshrooms.	Doomshrooms	The rift to your world has poisoned our home. Corrupted it. Polluted it. This expanse festers and grows. It becomes difficult to even see the purity of the rock beneath this filth. If you are here to lend your aid, then go about cleansing this overgrowth. Look for the brightly glowing mushrooms that are growing faster than the others. They are the worst of the offenders. 
If you want to help the Wardens attack the Forlorn Spire, seek out Captain Saynna Stormrunner in northeastern Ashen Fields.	The Warden's Charge	Captain Saynna Stormrunner is launching an attack against the Forlorn Spire. If you head to the northeast, you'll find her at the bottom of the ramp leading up towards that rise. I've assigned her a large number of our men, but her chances of success would be greatly increased if you join her cause. It's your decision, George. 
Kill 3 Druids of the Flame, while in Fire Crow form, with the Burd Sticker.	Bye Bye Burdy	Staghelm's druids are putting up a fierce fight at Wildflame Point to the northeast. The druids fly above us in fire crow form, then strike when we least expect it. Worst part is, they know exactly how to stay out of our reach! We would be totally helpless, except Damek lent me his trusty harpoon. He says these weapons will fly straight and true even in this super dense air. Take the dwarf's weapon and shoot some birds out of the sky! 
Kill 14 ghosts of any type at Largo's Overlook, just northeast of base camp.	Ghostbuster	See that hill just beyond our base camp? That's Largo's Overlook and it's not a fun place to setup camp next to. We have been dealing with those spirits and spectres ever since we setup base camp. Can you head up there and let them know we don't plan on leaving anytime soon? A few good kills on their ranks should put them in line. Thanks for your help on this, George. 
	The Vortex Pinnacle Reward Quest	 
	Lost City of the Tol'vir Reward Quest	 
	Halls of Origination Reward Quest	 
Make your way up top on the upper deck of the Vengeance Wake off the shore of the Lost Isles and speak with Thrall.	Meet Me Up Top	I never thought that I would be a prisoner of the Alliance again. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you... George, is it? I will meet you up top and from there we will deal with them. 
Capture 10 Wild Cluckers by attaching remote control fireworks to them.	Cluster Cluck	Ridiculous! The greatest goblin mind of all time reduced to food detail? I made the Micro Mechachicken just for this reason and they let it get away!<Hobart turns a deeper shade of green as his blood pressure rises.>Do I look like I should be rounding up escaped cluckers? No, my friend, not I! Bamm most definitely, though he's too lazy. Your station in life has recently taken a turn for the worse. You do it! Take these remote control fireworks and attach them to the cluckers. 
	Spires Ogre Gateway - Tracking	 
	Hour of Twilight Quest Reward	 
Kill 6 Water Pincers.	The Sting of Learning	There are dangers in the pools. The latest and most vicious are the water pincers. A time has come for their numbers to be diminished, and I am no longer up to the task. If you could clear out some of the water pincers, I would be very appreciative. Beware their numbers... sometimes it's best to lure them from the pool-side rather than wading all the way in. 
Kill stuff for Questvendor.	Kill Stuff	I really need you to kill some stuff for me. It's pretty important. 
Find Kilag Gorefang in the Vicious Vale on the Lost Isles.	The Vicious Vale	Our hunter, Kilag Gorefang, and a few scouts, traveled into the vale down the path to the west. They're ...searching for... 'precious cargo'... that we were guarding when the filthy Alliance sunk our ship. The way is blocked by deadly plants and they have not been able to break through. George, prove your worth as a goblin and a Mechanic. Journey into the Vicious Vale to find Kilag. 
Gather 10 Broken Bamboo Stalks.	Stocking Stalks	My men are malnourished, injured, and exhausted, but they are Horde. Every one will fight to their dying breath. As our new ally, we will stand by you when the time comes, but we would stand stronger with weapons. I have my men out gathering bamboo stalks to fashion into spears. If you can spare the effort, we could use the extra pair of capable hands. 
Collect 5 Shark Parts.	Who's Top of the Food Chain Now?	Fine, fine, perhaps the whole egg thing didn't quite pan out. Who's up for some shark meat? Only one little problem. Well, a big problem, actually. A really BIG problem: The Hammer! Of course, I have a brilliant idea. Swim out into the Dire Strait to the west and get us some shark parts. Give them to my assistant, Greely. I'm too important to get my hands dirty with the small details. 
Collect 5 scoops of Rockin' Powder.	Rockin' Powder	I'll give these pygmies one thing... they sure know how to party! But they're not so clever. I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder! It turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it! So, while you're in there at Oostan to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up! 
You have been tasked with killing Captain P. Harris at the Cape of Lost Hope. The Cape of Lost Hope can be found northwest of here, along the coast. Just look for the shipwrecks.	Captain P. Harris	The Cape of Lost Hope has been a sore in our side for weeks here on Tol Barad. Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there. To make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors. We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back. Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to. You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline. Oh, and I hope you are not too scared of sharks. 
	Throne of the Tides Bonus Reward	 
	Pandaria 88-90	 
Interact 3 Wards and speak with Wardkeeper Malo.	Interact - Doodad & Creature Test [DO NOT LOCALIZE]	Please complete this quest in order to testing the Interact - Doodad & Interact - Creature quest objective types. 
	Commander Springvale Reward Quest	 
	Deadmines Reward Quest	 
Speak with Kilag Gorefang at the Tranquil Coast on the Lost Isles.	Borrow Bastia	Head back down to the coast and tell Kilag that I'd like for you to borrow Bastia. The panther knows the way to where your friends are being held captive. Go now. I will see you again before we make our move against the Trade Prince. 
	Questflag for Captain's Log	 
	Shadowfang Keep Reward Quest	 
Collect 5 Intact Naga Hides.	Naga Hide	It's oft whispered in dark corners of a material so fine, so exquisite to the touch, that goblins of sophisticated taste will spend any amount of moolah to get their hands on some. Of course, I'm speaking of naga hide!<Brett looks around to make sure no one else is listening in.>I know that you're going to head down there and that it's inevitable that you're going to have to fight those snakes. Hey, they're not going to have a use for their hides anyway. They'll be dead! 
Speak with Dorda'en Nightweaver at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal.	The Fate of Runetotem	I apologize for speaking curtly with you earlier. The loss of Hamuul was shocking to me, and difficult to cope with. They brought in his body while you were away. He is alive, but - as you might imagine - he is very, very badly burned. The scars are deep. He may not live. I have arranged for some of our finest healers to attend to him. If it is not too much to ask, would you speak with Dorda'en Nightweaver? He and his fellow attendants may need your help. 
Kill 10 SI:7 Assassins. If something happens to your Orc Scout, return to Kilag to see if he has another for you to team up with.	Infrared = Infradead	Keep your voice down. The glen north and west of here is crawling with Alliance assassins. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to spot them. The cowards! They hide and won't fight face-to-face. You goblins are known for your wondrous goggles. Surely you have a pair that will allow you to see them? I need you to team up with one of my scouts and kill any of the SI:7 assassins that you spot. 
Obtain 4 Sulfur-Laced Wrappings from Fiery Behemoths in Sethria's Roost.	Treating the Wounds	We have an ample supply of medical supplies here at the Sanctuary, but we mustn't lose sight of the fact that we are at war. Hamuul isn't the only person who has need of bandages. The fiery behemoths that roam Sethria's Roost wear flame-resistant wrappings that will serve Hamuul as ably as any bandage. Bring me those wrappings, and I will prepare them for use on the Arch Druid. 
Meet up with Ban Bearheart outside Niuzao Temple in Townlong Steppes, and put a stop to the Mogu Invasion there.	Surprise Attack!	Those damnable Mogu...Those scouts were a distraction! While we were hunting their spies, the main force moved on Niuzao Temple. Corrupted serpents, Mogu everywhere... this is a disaster! Thankfully, Ban was able to make it past their lines with the most elite members of our order. If you can slip past, too, meet up with him. We need to put a stop to this! 
	The Crumbled Chamberlain	You there! Assist me. In life I was the Royal Chamberlain for his majesty, the Thunder King. For my dedication, I was condemned to this stone form, forever forced to watch over a portion of his wealth. Someone has desecrated my glorious body and sent pieces of it across the island. The thought of spending an eternity as nothing more than a head depresses me. Search the island, recover these pieces and I shall grant you one of his majesty's treasures. 
	A Mountain of Giant Dinosaur Bones	 
Slay Aiyu the Skillet, Jinanya the Clawblade, and Frenzyhop.	Leaders Among Breeders	Before any kegs are tapped, we have work to do. These virmen are no different than the virmen on the Wandering Isle... a nuisance that breeds as fast as the rabbits they resemble. Sure, we could kill every last virmen we find, but what's the point in needless bloodshed? Let's just take out their alphas, and they'll slow down with their... reproduction. 
Destroy the Southern, Central, Eastern and Western Idols at Sra'vess.	A Morale Victory	The mantid have statues built on Sra'vess. We don't know exactly what they use them for. They may have some sort of religious significance, or maybe they assist with their sonic communication. When you fight your opponent, you don't just engage them physically, you also engage them mentally. Whatever they use them for, the fact is that those statues are important to them. Which is why I want you to blow them up. Losing something important will be a substantial hit to morale. 
Speak to Haohan Mudclaw in The Heartland or at Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Growing the Farm III: The Mossy Boulder	Now that we're officially members of the Tillers Union, Mr. Mudclaw said he'd be happy to help us upturn this big ole' rock in the middle of our field. Once we clear away that stone, I've got something special planned. Run down and give him a holler to let him know that we're ready. 
Plant and harvest 1 Scallion, then deliver 5 Scallions to Gina Mudclaw. Scallion Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Scallions.	Learn and Grow VI: Gina's Vote	My business is doomed! You see all of the Ironpaws at their cooking stations? Their tasty dishes draw many of the customers to this market, but they're all out of scallions! It may not look like much, but the scallion is an essential cooking ingredient. Without it, foods are less savory, less flavorful, and less aromatic. This is terrible. I'm not getting another scallion shipment for a week! Wait a second. You're a farmer, aren't you? You think you could help me? 
Speak to Haohan Mudclaw at The Heartland or at Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Haohan's Vote I: Bungalow Break-In	This is going to be tough, George. The last vote we need comes from Haohan Mudclaw, the head of the Tillers Union. I know he wasn't too keen on us to start, but we've learned so much about farming, I'm sure he'll have a change of heart! Go speak to him. You can be very convincing, right? 
Use the Alliance Flare Gun.	The Silence	D..did we... do it?<Anduin mumbles the words, even though the effort clearly costs him.>L..look... in.. my... bag...Use... flare... 
Bring 20 Mad Brewer's Breakfast to Jogu the Drunk. Mad Brewer's Breakfasts can be made using the cooking profession.	Buy A Fish A Brewery?	All right, George, in order to continue my vishions, I must now have my own brewery....Just kidding! You should have sheen your own face! Hilarioush... hic! Anyway, I heard of a new drink that is unlike any other, and I would like a tashte. Have you heard of the Mad Brewer'sh Breakfasht? If you can bring me some of thish shtuff, you will be my friend for life. 
Report to Scout Captain Elsia at the Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes.	Thunder Calls	The time to attack the Thunder King has come! A small group of Sunreavers awaits you near the Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes. Report to Scout Captain Elsia for further instructions. 
Bring 6 Escaped Yaks to the Wash Entrance at Lao & Son's Yak Wash.	At the Yak Wash	Look, my father is crazy. I love him, but he's crazy. These yaungol managed to completely obliterate our ranch and scattered our yaks every which way. If I know my father though, he's going to try to go head to head with the yaungol to get the yaks back. Can you help us round up some of the yaks so my father doesn't do anything stupid? Just ride them over to the Yak Wash so we can clean them up and sell them to the grummles. 
Kill Chief Yip-Yip at Kunzen Cave to the northwest.	Haohan's Vote V: Chief Yip-Yip	You ready for the final step of the plan? The leader of the Kunzen hozen is a brute by the name of Chief Yip-Yip. It's said that he is nearly impervious to pain. I've injected the melons with a toxic mixture, so don't try eating them! Once you get his attention, throw these melons onto the ground. Yip-Yip won't be able to resist a sweet striped melon. When he takes a bite, he'll be temporarily weakened, and you should find yourself an opening to attack. 
Collect 20 Tasty T-Bone from the Skyrange Mushan on the Skyrange in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Lost and Lonely	The starving, mangy dog whines piteously and attempts a brief wag of its tail. It looks like it could use a good meal right about now.

Then, we take your carrots and pretend they are Mr. Mudclaw's. Yes! 
Use the Empty Pitcher at the Golden Falls to collect Thousand-Year Water.	Nana's Vote II: The Sacred Springs	You caught me at a good time, George. I was just hankering to make a fresh batch of Witchberry Julep. Have you ever heard of this wondrous brew? Each sip takes ten years off your face! How do you think I still look so good? Anyway, I need a special ingredient - thousand-year water - which can be collected from the mouth of the waterfall to the north. I'm afraid the journey is too treacherous for an old matron like me, but if you can get your hands on a pitcher, I'll let you share my brew. 
Speak to Fish Fellreed at Cattail Lake or the Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Growing the Farm II: The Broken Wagon	Hey George. I've been looking at that wagon every day, day in and day out, since the day I moved in. Quite an eyesore, don't you think? I heard in town that Fish Fellreed is quite handy with tools. She might be able to fix it up, and then we could turn that patch of land into a plot for farming. Why don't you talk to her and see if she'd be willing to do the job? 
Speak with Barnaby Fletcher in Halfhill Market.	A Shabby New Face	A strange fellow in a pointy hat showed up this morning trying to sell some kinda special seeds. Claimed they were magic. I welcome a little competition - business is business, after all - but this gentleman had a certain... shabby look to him. Oh, and he stunk somethin' FIERCE. Would you check up on him, just to make sure he's on the level? He's over there by Jian Ironpaw, making a meal out of the samples. 
Speak with Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market and acquire a Packet of Green Cabbage Seeds.	Learn and Grow I: Seeds	Well, first things first! I'm going to need lots of help 'round here. If we're going to be partners, you've got to learn how to harvest crops, and if you wanna harvest crops you gotta plant seeds! Now it's my understanding that a mister, uh... Grainfell? No, that wasn't it... Greedfill? That doesn't sound right...Greenfield! That's his name! He's the man to see for seeds. Greenfield's got a stall over at Halfhill Market, directly southeast of here - go see him and pick up some vegetable seeds. 
Return 5 Escaped Shagskins to Farmer Fung's yak pen at the very north end of the Verdant Belt.	Farmer Fung's Vote II: On the Loose	You want my vote for Farmer Yoon? Ha! You're joking, right? Listen, I'm not going to vote for some citypaw with no lick a' knowledge about farming the earth. It would be an embarrassment to farm alongside you or that Yoon shmuck. Now let me deal with my own problems. Some devil let my prize yaks loose, and now they're running wild northwest of Halfhill. If I could just get my yaks back, then maybe I'd be able to sleep at night. 
Defeat Ishi and destroy the Divine Bell.	Breath of Darkest Shadow	Garrosh is right over there, and he's going to ring that bell at any moment. We don't have time to wait for my father's army. This is our only chance to stop him! I'll attempt to appeal to his senses before resorting to using the Harmonic Mallet. Charge in whenever you're ready, George. I'll be right behind you. 
Join the Order of the Cloud Serpent.	Riding the Skies	I can no longer call myself your teacher, George. You have proven yourself worthy of your cloud serpent. Today, you shall join our ranks. Are you ready? 
Round up 3 Wild Plains Yaks and return them to Westwind Rest.	Round 'Em Up	Mobility is going to be key to maintaining our foothold in this new land. Problem is, there's no way to maintain mobility without mounts, and... well, we don't have many of those here, now do we? The local yaks seem to make good mounts. At least, the local pandaren say they do. Why don't you go round some up for us? 
Investigate the Dark Soil underneath Farmer Yoon's house, then give a gift to Gina Mudclaw at the Halfhill Market.	Learn and Grow V: Halfhill Market	All right friend, all of that farming was just for practice! Are you ready to try the real thing? There's a lady by the name of Gina Mudclaw who runs the Halfhill Market, which is across the street to the south. I heard she's looking to buy some vegetables. Since it's your first time meeting her, you shouldn't go empty-handed. Why don't you look around the ranch and see if there are any items hiding around? Might be that we'll find a good gift to take to our new neighbor! 
Enter the ""A Little Patience"" scenario and report to King Varian Wrynn.	A Little Patience	King Varian needs decisive adventurers to help him resolve a showdown between Tyrande Whisperwind and a detachment of Horde warriors holed up in the Temple of the Red Crane. Report to him immediately!

Mr. Haohan's last harvest of melons got stolen, so we're going to have to grow some of our own. Once we have our harvest, we'll use them to lure the nasty hozen's leader out of its cave! 
Speak to Gai Lan at The Heartland in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Growing the Farm I: The Weeds	Hey George, I've been thinkin' recently about expanding my farm. See that plot there that's just covered in weeds? If we can get rid of those weeds, we could use that land for planting. I heard there's a farmer by the name of Gai Lan who knows a thing or two about weed whackin'. His farm is just out west. Go talk to him and see if he'd be willing to help us. 
Bring 1 Four Wind Soju to Jogu the Drunk. Four Wind Soju can be purchased from most bartenders in Pandaria.	Buy A Fish A Drink?	Heeeey buddy, how'sh it goin'? You wanna buy a jinyu a drink? 
Speak to Mung-Mung at Haohan Mudclaw's House in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Mung-Mung's Vote I: A Hozen's Problem	I've been thinkin' about how to get into the Tiller's good graces, George. Now, the Tiller's Union accepts new farmers each year, and there are five members on the voting council. We already got Gina's vote, but we'll have to prove ourselves to the other four members of their board. Why don't you go over and say hello to Mung-Mung? He works with Mr. Mudclaw out on the Mudclaw's farm to the northwest. 
Challenge and defeat Xiao at the Tian Monastery.	Xiao, the Eater	You may have already met my best student, Xiao, at the banquet tables. I personally would have graduated him several times over, but Instructor Xann insists that he needs more discipline. If you ask me, discipline means very little if you win every fight you enter. I'm curious to see if Xiao can keep his streak alive against you. 
Speak to Farmer Fung at The Heartland or the Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Farmer Fung's Vote I: Yak Attack	The next voting member on the Tiller's council is Farmer Fung, and it's easy to see why. That man's vegetables are the biggest in the valley! I only hope that someday I can grow pumpkins as big as his. If we hope to join the Tillers, he would be the next person to convince. 
Harvest 2 EZ-Gro Green Cabbages from your field and bring them to Farmer Yoon in Sunsong Ranch.	Learn and Grow IV: Harvesting	It's time for our hard work to pay off! Normally we'd have to wait a day before the crops are ready to harvest. Fortunately, those seeds Greenfield gave us were specially designed to grow FAST. The yield won't be worth much, but they're good for stepping new farmers through the process. Our cabbages should be ready to harvest. I'll let you do the honors, of course! 
Defeat Shonuf.	Contending With Bullies	We honor strength here, not brutality. It is unfortunate but there are some who come to my doorstep oblivious to this distinction. I have turned away one such challenger. In retaliation, he sacked the village of Yinying. Go to Yinying Village southeast of the temple, and face this ""Shonuf."" Give him a lesson in true strength. 
Speak with Admiral Taylor at Binan Village in Kun-Lai Summit.	Admiral Taylor has Awakened	It would seem that your Admiral Taylor has awakened from his injuries. He and his people are upstairs. He has requested your presence. 
Use the Rusty Watering Can to water 2 Parched EZ-Gro Green Cabbages at Sunsong Ranch.

Pamper her and she'll grow big and plump and you can put a ribbon on her and take her to market to show her off to your frie-"" look, he was from a different time, okay? The point is, now that our cabbages have sprouted, they need attention! Today they look a little dry, so you should water them. Here's the old watering can grandpa left. It will always be near the field if you need it. 
Speak to Nana Mudclaw at Halfhill in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Nana's Vote I: Nana's Secret Recipe	The next vote we'll need is from Nana Mudclaw. She's Haohan's grandmother, and she's been a Tiller longer than you and I have been alive! She's still working at the Tillers building in Halfhill. Why don't you pay her a visit? 
Speak to Farmer Yoon.	Inherit the Earth	As you know, George, I'm getting along in my years. One can't stay a spry young pandaren forever, you know. I'm looking for someone to take over my duties here at the Tillers Union, and I can't think of a better person than Farmer Yoon. He's got a good deal to learn, but he's got a good head on his shoulders and most importantly, a generous heart. Do you think he'd be interested? 
Investigate 8 Suspicious Footprints.	Haohan's Vote II: The Real Culprits	What are YOU doing here, citypaw? Look, I've got my hands full with a break-in at my shed to the west. Some rascals came in the middle of the night and ransacked the place. I've got missing seeds, broken tools, and eaten inventory to deal with. I'll just add it to my list of other troubles: a whole wagon of melons stolen, a broken water pump, animals ruining my harvest...I wish that I could just get to the bottom of all this already! 
Speak to Anduin Wrynn at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit.	Temple of the White Tiger	Have you heard the news, traveller? There's been an attack at one of our most sacred places, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms! Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within. The temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai. Maybe you can convince the White Tiger to allow you inside? I only hope the Vale has not been utterly destroyed... 
Plant and harvest 3 Witchberries, then deliver 15 Witchberries to Nana Mudclaw. Witchberry Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Witchberries.	Nana's Vote III: Witchberry Julep	Now that we have the water, I can almost taste the icy cold witchberry julep! Now, we just need to find ourselves some sweet witchberries. My grandson's berries this season have been total slop, so I need to seek a decent harvest elsewhere. Say, do you have any witchberries in the ground this year? How about you bring me some from your farm? If your berries are up to the standard, we'll make ourselves a grand old batch of the old juice! 
Speak with Zhang Ku in Vale of Eternal Blossoms for your reward.	Supplies from the Rajani	The Rajani appreciates all the help you've given us. Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us. 
Gather 6 Spideroot for Gai Lan.	Growing the Farm I: A Little Problem	So you need to whack some wily weeds? No problem, neighbor! Only thing is, I'm running low on weed killer. I make my own concoction - very potent, totally organic and good for the earth. Plants love it! Well... except for those pesky weeds. They hate the stuff! If you bring me some Spideroot from the terraces just west of us, I'll make a fresh batch and go down to Yoon's farm myself. I would gather some myself but... well... I hate spiders. You'll see what I mean. 
Bring 5 Pandaren Plum Wine to Jogu the Drunk. Pandaren Plum Wine can be purchased from most bartenders in Pandaria.	Buy A Fish A Round?	Heeeey it's my friend, the Human! I guesh you've seen me hanging 'round, but I should 'splain that I'm not drunk. I mean, look at me now! Shober as a freshwater fish! Sure I like to drown my sorrowsh in some good brew now and then, but you can't inebriate a jinyu! Might as well try to drown a fish! No, the brewsh make me shleepy, and when I shleep, I have vishions of the future. The shtronger the brew, the more potent my dreamsh! If you bring me a drink, I'll owe you one. 
Speak with Barnaby Fletcher to learn more about Portal Shards.	One Magical, Flying Kingdom's Trash...	Before we enter into a business relationship, I am required by the terms of my rehabilitation program to inform you that I am a recovering potion addict. There, now that THAT's out of the way, let's talk portals! You see, the big portals in the cities - the ones running all day and night - leak tons of magical energy. It crystallizes around the edges and is generally regarded as trash. But I noticed during my, uh... hiatus in the sewers of Dalaran, that these shards still had power. Interested? 
Rescue 6 Inkgill Dissenters in Inkgill Mere.	Free the Dissenters	Not all of my fellow villagers from Inkgill are corrupted. Many heeded my warnings and did not drink of the sha-tainted waters. They are in hiding, terrified, and intimidated by the guards. Please, tell them there is hope! Go into the village to the north. Speak with them and send them to me.

After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Green Cabbages.	Farmer Fung's Vote III: Crazy For Cabbage	<Farmer Fung is beaming with a radiant smile.>Thanks to you, I got my precious yaks back! Unfortunately, I noticed that their time out in the wild left them rather gaunt. They must be starving, but I don't feed my prize yaks just any regular old grass. No sir, they eat only the leafiest green cabbages you can find here in the Valley. My stores are a bit low. If you bring me some cabbages for my yaks, I will reward you handsomely. 
Bring 10 Jade Witch Brew to Jogu the Drunk. Jade Witch Brew can be made using the cooking profession.	Buy A Fish A Keg?	My dreams grow dim recently, Human.

Free 8 Captive Pandaren Cubs from Twinspire Keep by slaying the demonic eyeballs that watch over them.	Unfair Trade	Though we have only just met, we have a common enemy: this group called the ""Horde.""Several days ago, their leader made us a trade offer. When we refused, his servants abducted several of our cubs as bargaining chips. We have called in the Shado-Pan to help, but they are in Kun-Lai Summit, a journey of several days. Can you come to our aid? 
Collect 100 Waxed Planks.	Growing the Farm II: Knock on Wood	Sure! I know just the wagon that you're talkin' about! I can fix it right up, but I'll need wood. There's a whole lot of it down at the bottom of the lake. If you fish it right out - haha, get it? Fish? Oh I just crack myself up sometimes. Anyway, you bring me here some 'o that wood and then I'll get right to work! 
Speak to Farmer Yoon at Sunsong Ranch in the Valley of the Four Winds.	The Tillers	The Tillers do their business at Halfhill in the Valley of the Four Winds. If you're interested in getting started, I hear there's a new farmer in town by the name of Farmer Yoon. I betcha he'll be looking for help. 
Collect 1 Bloodbloom, 1 Cave Lily, 1 Ghostcap, and 1 Violet Lichen.	Haohan's Vote III: Pure Poison	All right, George. This is our big chance! Mr. Mudclaw's farm is in big trouble. Those mountain hozen are coming down at night, wrecking his crops and eating his hard-earned harvest. We've got to get rid of them for good, and I know just how to do it. Back in the day, my grandpa showed me how to mix a wounding poison to deal with the pests on the farm. The virmen warrens to the north hold the key ingredients for my mixture. Don't look so worried, George! I'm pretty sure this is going to work. 
Collect 10 Partially Chewed Carrots.	Mung-Mung's Vote II: Rotten to the Core	Dem virmen's back! They been biting Mr. Mudclaw's carrots. Ruining his crop. And who is gonna pay? Mung-Mung, that's who!

You do this for me? 
Speak with Scout Lynna at Krasarang Cove in Krasarang Wilds.	Meet the Scout	It has been two months since the parting of the mists.

Defeat 3 rare mantid enemies in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Champions of the Swarm	It is clear that Shek'zara is fully committed to this invasion. Our scouts have spotted some of her greatest champions among the battlefield. Any one of these mantid could prove too much for the soldiers of the Golden Lotus to overcome. We must hunt them down and eliminate them ourselves. Are you in? 
Defeat 3 rare minions of N'Zoth in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	The Strongest Among Them	You have shown great strength in your conquests, but new enemies assail the Vale with each day. Seek out the strongest that our foes have sent forth, and bring them down for their allies to see. 
Find and kill the Shan'ze Spymaster.	Mogu Incursions	We've heard reports of a group of Mogu infiltrating the coast here in Townlong. I have no idea what they are doing. Frankly, I don't care. You've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you. What's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them. Our scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and Deadtalker's Plateau. Go there and wipe them out. 
Escort Chen Stormstout and Li Li to the brewery in the southwest.	Great Minds Drink Alike	Hello again, George. What is this, the fourth time we've run into one another already?

Speak to Instructor Tong at Windward Isle in the Jade Forest.	Choosing the One	I have examined each egg, George. Out of the lot that you brought me, I have chosen the three eggs with the most promise. You may choose only one egg to take with you. Are you ready to make your final selection? 
Recover 3 Shan'ze Ritual Stones. These stones are very rare, and may take some time to gather.	Secrets in the Isle of Thunder	I do have one thing I would ask of you, Mechanic. We've gotten our hands on a powerful ritual stone that the Shan'ze mogu use to beckon their allies into battle, but we need more than one to perform their rituals. If you come upon three of these stones, bring them back to me. We can gather our forces and use these stones to beckon some of Lei Shen's most powerful servants directly into our traps.

Speak to Xuen and pass his tests.	A Celestial Experience	The human calf is arguing on our behalf. He is well-spoken; I can see why Baine Bloodhoof regards the prince so highly. Still, the argument does not go well. I am of little consequence, but you are a hero of the Horde. Perhaps you can intercede in our favor? Speak with the White Tiger and plead our case, Human. Be careful! He may set a number of challenges before you...

Unfortunately, the pathway to Liang's farm is currently swarming with Snagtooth virmen. We're going to have to ask Miss Fanny to help us out.

Enter the ""Dagger in the Dark"" scenario and report to Vol'jin.	Dagger in the Dark	Shadow Hunter Vol'jin has joined a group of Kor'kron scouts on an important mission for the warchief. Of course a proud member of the Horde such as yourself is welcome to go along, but be warned - it could get ugly. 
Complete the ""Blood in the Snow"" scenario. You can queue from the Dungeon Finder or use Lorewalker Cho's Dream Brew.	The King and the Council	I am glad you are here, George. I have been using my dream brew to experience events around the world, but the more I learn, the more confused I become. For instance, King Wrynn has asked the dwarves of Ironforge for more troops, but they do not all support him. I will tell you more, but I would also like to hear from your experience firsthand... 
Find Han Stormstout in the Morrowchamber beneath Kor'vess.	Han Stormstout	There will be time for mourning later. For now, there are other Stormstouts to be found. They say that Han Stormstout was last seen exploring Kor'vess. I suspect he headed into that mantid burrow, just across the way. You should meet me down there, George.

Light the Signal Fire on the beach of the Horde Landing Site to signal the Horde fleet.	Domination Point	Now it is time to show this new land the true strength of the Horde. Return to the beach and light the remaining signal fire. Our fleet is waiting. 
Kill 200 Mantid while controlling Kovok in the Scar.	Rampage Against the Machine	Kovok has progressed at an astonishing rate. Perhaps the years in hibernation effected his growth process...Whatever the reason, this could not have come at a better time. I believe it is time to test his abilities. You have done so much to aid in his training. It is only fitting that you assist him in his first battle. I've already guided him to the edge of the scar. Find him and destroy Shek'zeer's army! 
Find Mina Mudclaw.	The Farmer's Daughter	Brave Mechanic, you could not have arrived at a better time. My daughter is missing! I've got a suspicion that the virmen took her down into that stinking little warren of theirs. I'm too old to fight virmen, and my farmhand is already exhausted from fighting them off all morning. Could you look for her? 
Use the Flare Launcher in Krasarang Cove to signal the Alliance fleet.	Lion's Landing	For too long the Horde has been allowed to run rampant across Azeroth.

Loot 3 Mogu Plunder from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Plunder the Plunderers	Our raids on Lei Shen's treasuries did much to ensure the Thunder King's downfall. I think we should employ the same strategy here. Seek out the hoarded plunder of the mogu clans and relieve them of it. We must do all we can to disrupt their advance. 
Slay Magister Brasael.	Cashing Out	I just saw one of the Sunreavers - Brasael, I think his name was - running off in the direction of the bank to the north. No doubt he's trying to gather whatever assets he can before he leaves. Head him off and make sure he doesn't steal any resources from our coffers. He relinquished whatever funds he left in the bank when he and his Sunreaver kind betrayed us. 
Meet Chen and Li Li Stormstout at the Gate of the August Celestials.	Mogu at the Gates	The time has come. The other mogu clans have set their sights on the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

Use Mudmug's Vial to gather muddy water.	Muddy Water	While you're just hangin' around, I might as well get you involved in my whole beer-makin' ""process"". Ain't much of a process, really... I just mix all the stuff together and wait. You probably heard - I like to use the muddy water from the riverbanks, to the south. Would you mind fillin' up this flask with that water and bringin' it back? I'll start gettin' the hops and barley all ready. 
	Onyx To Goodness	 
Find Malkorok at Emperor's Reach. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	The Bell Speaks	Your efforts have culminated in this moment, Mechanic. Warchief Garrosh gathers the most elite champions of the Horde in Kun-Lai Summit to witness the ringing of the Divine Bell. You have more than earned the right to participate. Go now.

Summon and defeat the Archiereus of Flame.	The Archiereus Of Flame	Your efforts have driven back the Ordon and brought peace to the Celestial Court, but it will not last. It is time to silence the great emissary of Ordos - the Archiereus of Flame. Speak with Mistweaver Ku and purchase a scroll of challenge, then travel to Three-Breeze Terrace to the north. Issue a challenge at the challenge stone, it will undoubtedly catch the attention of the Ordon, drawing the archiereus out of the Ordon Sanctuary. It is your only chance. 
Follow Chen Stormstout to Pang's Stead.	Chen and Li Li	My niece and I are new to Pandaria. Probably like yourself. We're visitors from the Wandering Isle, and, to be honest, we have no idea where we're going. That farm up ahead looks as fine a place as any to take off our shoes and enjoy a brew. What do you say, Li Li? Human? Would you like to share the road with us? 
Correctly answer one of Evelyna's questions about the history of Azeroth.	A Timeless Question	Destiny. Fate. Karma. Words like these imply that the timeways are unassailable. Would that were the case. To this day, many of Azeroth's inhabitants yearn to change the past. Yet just as our experiences shape us, they also shape the world around us. Consider how those threads have woven the fabric of today's reality. Cut enough threads, and causation inevitably fails, unraveling that fabric. Indeed, cutting even a single thread short can result in disaster, provided it is the right thread. 
Enter and complete the Arena of Annihilation scenario. Afterwards, collect your reward from Wodin the Troll-Servant.	The Arena of Annihilation	Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand. We've come a long way, eh, Wodin? I tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap. So much so that they've paid good coin for me to set up shop here and help draw the strongest fighters from all around! So how about it? You and a couple friends up for a few rounds in the Arena of Annihilation...? Big money, big prizes! 
Find Instructor Tong at Windward Isle in the Jade Forest.	Wild Things	Welcome to the Order of the Cloud Serpent, Human. I can see from the spark in your eye that you wish to join the Order. Let me get a good look at you.<Elder Anli gently holds your head and gazes at your face.>Hmm. I see honesty and earnestness in your heart. You have journeyed far to come here, but I am afraid you must go yet further. Your path into the Order begins now. Speak to Instructor Tong at Windward Isle to the northeast to take the first step. 
Enter the basement of the Temple of the Red Crane and defeat the Sha of Despair.	In the House of the Red Crane	""Broken are the bodies wherein hopeless hearts reside - the blight of despair strikes forth from inside.""This was the last piece of wisdom the Red Crane imparted to me, just hours before the Sha outbreak. It makes sense now...$p, when the Sha attacked, they broke forth from the temple's basement...All of his teachings - the very Way of the Crane itself... it's all been preparation for facing the Sha of Despair. The Red Crane has been expecting this conflict for centuries! 
Speak to one of your best friends and ask them to work on Sunsong Ranch.	A Second Hand	Despite your best efforts, the work is starting to pile up around here. Perhaps you could ask one of your best friends if they'd like to help out at Sunsong Ranch. 
Awaken Skeer the Bloodseeker in the underwater cave.	Skeer the Bloodseeker	Our efforts to secure the shallows before Zan'vess have paid off. We have spotted another paragon buried in amber, hidden in the waters to the southwest. Adding another paragon to our numbers is vital. Another champion from ages past could turn the tide in our favor. I would go immediately, but unfortunately, I am needed here. Since you are already a Wakener, you can carry out this task in my stead. 
Use the Vision of Time in the Siege of Orgrimmar.	A Vision in Time	Look at how the Vision reacts! Astounding! Even now it shows shadows of timeways that flit around us constantly. Though not true sands of the Hourglass of Time, the finely-ground epoch stones certainly have a power all their own. Our first task is to use them to calibrate the Vision of Time. Take the Vision of Time to a location where history is in the making: the Siege of Orgrimmar. Once there, turn the hourglass and see what happens. 
Defeat Captain Ook.	The Funky Monkey Brew	Pirates! Our shores have been scoured by the most ill-tempered, ill-mannered, ill-hygienic, and ill-good hozen that ever was found in Pandaria. And to make matters worse, they claim to serve the legendary Captain Ook! We see them every night partying and brewing punch on their island Unga Ingoo. I say we take their brew for a change! I think I can even improve their mix. Gather up some friends and meet me on the southern side of Unga Ingoo. It is time for a Brew Run! 
Use Cho's Heirloom at Cho's Family Shrine on Serpent's Overlook. Speak with Mishi for transportation.	Last Piece of the Puzzle	These hozen are behaving most unnaturally, George. Marching in formation? In armor? This troubles me. We must discuss it at another time, however. I have come to ask for your assistance. The ancient fresco, where last we spoke, is nearly unveiled. I am certain that it holds ancient wisdom - knowledge that the emperor wanted us to remember. My meditations alone may not be enough to discern its meaning. Please, take this heirloom to the shrine of my ancestors. I shall require their assistance. 
Find Father's Bedroll, Father's Shield, Ha-Cha, and Sentinel Yalo.	Father's Footsteps	Yes, the boy's father - Sentinel Ku-Yao - has gone missing. He could be any number of places... we have no shortage of enemies these days. You're free to look around, if you wish. You might start by looking for his yak, or by asking Sentinel Yalo what he knows. 
Use the Barrel of Fireworks near the Pile of Stolen Weapons, the Pile of Stolen Tools, the Pile of Stolen Beer, and the Pile of Stolen Grain.	Simian Sabotage	The hozen steal from us, and we keep stealing our stuff back. It has to stop sometime.<Farmer Yoon hands you a barrel of fireworks.>Find some of our stolen supplies in their mountain camp to the west, and place these fireworks beside them. Hopefully, if they see the explosions, they'll think our supplies are defective and stop stealing altogether. It's worth a shot, right? 
Investigate the mantid infighting at the Terrace of Gurthan.	Psycho Mantid	You aren't going to believe what I saw! Two mantid fighting each other, whipping some serious magic back and forth. One of them didn't look like any mantid I've ever seen. Completely different color and dress to him, like some kind of... oracle or something. The other one was a total psycho, splashing sha energy around like it was a keg of Stormstout Special. Look, I gotta get back to my post, but those two are still fighting in the cave behind me and I have a feeling it's a big deal. Check it out? 
Collect 50 Lesser Charms of Good Fortune.	Warforged Seals	Greetings, George. I am privileged to offer you an excellent opportunity. Through the centuries, we've honed a method by which the very laws of chance themselves can be bent. With a Warforged Seal, valuable artifacts will find their way into your hands more frequently as you pursue Garrosh and his forces. 
Protect a group of grummles travelling to the Burlap Waystation. At least one grummle must survive. If you lose your grummles, you can search the Burlap Trail or return to One Keg and wait for the next group to leave.	The Burlap Trail: To Burlap Waystation	Bad fortune for grummles today. Hozen have begun to ravage! They attack our supply line to the Serpent's Spine. Can you help? We are not fighters. We are grummles. Good fortune to those who help grummles. Go with a group of grummles to the Burlap Waystation. Keep them safe. Make sure at least one grummle survives. Grummles shall reward. Grummles always reward. 
Earn an Honored Reputation with Shaohao by defeating yaungol forces on the Timeless Isle.	Drive Back The Flame	The pandaren once existed in harmony with the Ordon yaungol. When the island suddenly disappeared, the Ordon faced certain death. In their desperation, the chief shaman called out for aid to the Fire Lords, and was answered. Ordos was his name. Now, he is a creature of anger and violence. Though his people were saved, he burns endlessly in molten agony. There is harmony no longer. The Ordon seek to take the Celestial Court, and sacrifice us all to Ordos. Drive them back, and restore balance. 
Investigate the Thunder Forge to find the Secrets of Lightning Steel.	Lightning Steel	Your trained eyes can see that this metal ingot has some very strange properties. Perhaps there are clues to its nature somewhere around here? 
Accompany Garrosh Hellscream to find Blood Guard Gro'tash, Grizzle Gearslip, and slay 25 Alliance.	The Might of the Warchief	Come, Mechanic! I want to inspect this island and ensure that my landing team has done their job. Blood Guard Gro'tash should be somewhere on the northern side of the island looking for a suitable place to build our keep. The goblin survey team will have gone up the eastern coast in search of oil. Let us crush this pitiful display and claim this land for the Horde! 
Stomp out 6 Eyes of the Empress around the Terrace of Gurthan. Killing anything will grant you Pheromone Tracking, helping you detect them.	Debugging the Terrace	If this Empress is truly possessed by fear and paranoia, she will have sent scouts to every corner of the land in order to cement her control. These scout grubs are likely everywhere, but difficult to spot with the naked eye. Better to track them by the pheromone trails they leave behind. I've already... gifted you... a reactive toxin that will reveal these trails to you for a brief time after experiencing the thrill of victory. Go now to the Terrace of Gurthan and root out these spies. 
Travel with Vereesa Windrunner to the Isle of Thunder.	The Storm Gathers	There is no time to waste, George. Every moment we delay here gives the Sunreavers more of a hold on the Isle. Lady Jaina Proudmoore awaits us. We should not make her wait any longer. Speak to me when you are ready to depart. I will escort you there myself. 
Accompany King Varian Wrynn to find Marshal Troteman, Hilda Hornswaggle, and slay 25 Horde.	A King Among Men	There's no time to waste, we need to find Troteman and secure the beach. We should check on the dwarves, too - the Explorer's League is tough, but they're no army. They should be along the cliff just north of here. Let us ride, Mechanic. For our friends. For the Alliance. 
Retrieve the Ancient Guo-Lai Artifact.	The Crumbling Hall	An ancient mogu artifact has been uncovered in the Guo-Lai Vault, beyond the Hall of Statues. We've made repeated attempts to retrieve it, but none have been successful. We cannot let this artifact fall into the hands of the Shao-Tien. I need someone capable to retrieve it, and quickly. Are you in? 
Speak with Chromie outside of the Seat of Knowledge in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	A Flash of Bronze...	As you survey the devastation of the vale, a flash of bronze catches your eye. Unless you're mistaken, a tiny gnome is trying to catch your attention from the balcony above Mogu'shan Palace, just outside of the Seat of Knowledge. You should see what she wants. 
Destroy Torjar's Bane.	Parental Mastery	If them tablets were correct, all ay got ta do is a small dance ritual and the big thing o' the deep will be summoned. When it comes out, we'll get 'em and show me pop we are both true big game hunters like him. 
	A Large Pile of Giant Dinosaur Bones	 
Enter the Survival Ring and survive for 60 seconds without leaving.	Survival Ring: Flame	This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare. Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes. 
Defeat 10 Kor'kron Overseers, 5 Kor'kron Subjugators, and Gul'tar the Subjugator.	De-Subjugation	The Kor'kron have been trained to be the finest, most loyal soldiers of the Warchief. Their presence here means that Garrosh fears an uprising. Vol'jin and his people are as much a part of the Horde as any orc. We must break this occupation and free the trolls. It pains me to say this, but you must eliminate enough of the Kor'kron so that the trolls can retake their city. Then meet me at Darkspear Hold so we might challenge their officer directly. 
Find the Buried Hozen Treasure.	Buried Hozen Treasure	The map you hold is crinkled, dirty, and poorly drawn, but you can see a big X on a beach. Is there buried treasure somewhere on this island? 
Deliver the Claw of Anger to Ban Bearheart at the Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes.	Remnants of Anger	As you look upon the severed claw of the defeated Sha of Anger, you realize that Ban Bearheart, commander of the Shado-Pan in Townlong Steppes, would want to know of your victory. 
Read the Tablet of Thunder in the Tomb of Conquerors.	Lessons from History	The Thunder King was a vicious Emperor and with the Zandalari at his side he was unstoppable. His return would surely return this land to turmoil and misery. You must locate his remains and take them somewhere safe. The Tablet of Thunder should help you figure out how to access his tomb. 
Speak with Watcher Alundra on the Timeless Isle, off the coast of the Jade Forest.	Journey to the Timeless Isle	The bronze dragonflight has discovered a most unusual pandaren phenomenon, Mechanic. Emerging from the mists, far off the coast of the Jade Forest - an island that was lost in time! It is a dangerous place, perhaps the most perilous in all of Pandaria. But we are determined to unravel its mysteries. Here, take this timepiece. A single click will whisk you to the island. Get yourself established, and speak with Watcher Alundra. She will guide you to our chief investigator. 
Awaken the paragon in Duskroot Fen.	Dropping Our Signal	The beacon in Amberglow Hollow seems to have been tampered with. Right before the signal cut out the Klaxxi'va picked up a signal for another paragon nearby. They believe he is hidden in that wretched little swamp, Duskroot Fen. I will meet you in the fen to set up a temporary beacon until I can get Amberglow operational again. You will wake the paragon and then you will help me. 
Search the Wreck of the Vanguard in Jade Forest for clues about its cargo, and recover the Encoded Captain's Log.	The White Pawn	Alright, soldier. I've got a critical mission for you. Get down to the coastline south of here - in the cove there you'll find a wrecked Alliance vessel. I need you to search it and find out if it was the ship that was carrying Anduin. Then, recover the Captain's Log and see if it has any information on where we can find him. Since the log is from a military ship, it'll be written using a cipher - take it to Nodd Codejack afterwards. He's keeping watch on the wreck from the other end of the cove. 
Speak to the Shado-Pan Monastery Sentinel to gain entrance to the Shado-Pan Monastery.	Unbelievable!	I simply refuse to believe the guards will not grant us entry to the monastery should we impress upon them the seriousness of the situation. Friend, go east, to the sentinel in front of the Monastery, and demand admittance. I will come with you. 
Speak with Sunwalker Dezco at the Gate of the August Celestials.	A Witness to History	I will gather up the other Tauren pilgrims and we will travel into the Vale together. Meet me at the Gate of the August Celestials at the southern edge of Kun-Lai Summit and speak with me there. 
Investigate the Niuzao Catacombs, then slay the Dread Shadow that dwells within.	The Terrible Truth	It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your suspicions. The mantid are indeed under the sway of the Sha of Fear. It was OUR sworn duty to confine that creature beneath our temple. Unfortunately, our vigil faltered, our defenses buckled, and the sha escaped. It is with the mantid now. See for yourself. The mantid burrowed into the western side of our island. 
Complete the Sky Race by flying through 10 checkpoints, then passing underneath the Finish Line at The Arboretum.	The Sky Race	The time for the great race is upon us! Traverse the course among the spires and pass through the checkered flags on each of the 10 balloon checkpoints. Make sure to pass underneath the finish line when you are done. The competition will be fierce, but I wish you luck. Speak to me when you are ready to begin. 
Free the Tormented Skyscreamer.	Pterrible Ptorment	One of the trolls' skyscreamers in Za'Tual is undergoing a ritual of torture, its will being bent forever to serve its masters. Kill those that inflict such torment on the creature and we can only hope that it will return to the skies. 
Defeat the Sra'thik Hivelord.	Target of Opportunity: Sra'thik Hivelord	Near the ocean, on the eastern side of Sra'vess, there is a cavern that leads to a network of caves. From there, the Sra'thik Hivelord maintains Sra'vess and plots against us. If we manage to take him out, we'll disrupt their operations for days. Let's go to it. 
Locate the missing Zhu's Watch Courier in the northern area of the Dojani River, then continue on to the Temple of the Red Crane and speak with Koro Mistwalker.	Into the Wilds	Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers. They should be told of what happened here. If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone north. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker. 
Report to undercover agent Townsley in Bizmo's Brawlpub in the Stormwind side of Deeprun Tram.	The Best Around	We're going to need help if we hope to figure out Garrosh's plans for Pandaria. I have someone specific in mind, but he will not be easy to convince. Agent Connelly considers himself retired, but one does not simply leave the SI: 7. We've had an undercover agent following his every move for months. Currently, he is disguising himself as a high roller at Bizmo's Brawlpub. Something about settling an old debt. Meet with our undercover agent in the Brawler's Guild. 
Speak to Xuen at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit.	Trial At The Temple of the White Tiger	Xuen, the great Celestial of the North, seeks the greatest champions in the land. Today, he holds trials of battle at his temple in Kun-Lai Summit. If you wish to test yourself against skilled fighters from all across Pandaria, then go to him and enter the challenger's ring! 
Kill 7 Mistblade Rippers and the Mistblade Scale-Lord.	Amber Is Life	In order for our efforts against the mantid empire to continue, we require more amber. There is a great deposit of amber underneath the lake to the south, but the area is inhabited by a savage saurok tribe. I cannot spare anyone else. You must go to the lake and test the tribe's strength. Thin their numbers and eliminate their leader, who is probably hiding in his underground cavern. Surely this is not too great a task for you? 
Slay 10 Bataari Tribe Members in the Kun-Lai Pass until the Bataari Fire-Warrior appears. Then kill him.	Call Out Their Leader	Clearly, you are a hero come to aid us. Slay the Bataari Tribe in the Kun-Lai Pass to the northwest until the Bataari Fire-Warrior is angered enough to appear. Dispatch him. 
Find Professor Kilt in the Boom Room in Bizmo's Brawlpub.	Stirred, Not Shaken	Alright, I'll tell you how to find Connelly. Agent Connelly is currently posing as the high roller, Professor Kilt. He spends most of his time in the Boom Room. Rumor has it he's after one of the fighters for some long forgotten betrayal. Unfortunately, the lounge is by invitation only. Lucky for you I just happen to have an invitation. Try not to look too obvious when you walk past the bouncers. If you get caught you didn't get this pass from me. In fact you and I have never met! 
Seal 12 Sha Fissures to banish the Sha of Doubt.	The Seal is Broken	<Cho looks at you in disbelief.>I... I thought Sha of this immensity were a myth - we all did. Just a story to keep our children from fighting. No time to talk now. Those fissures - they're feeding it... it grows stronger by the moment! I must research the scrolls from my family archives. You, take this cannon and ride Mishi. You must find a way to contain this horror that has been unleashed! 
Obtain a Chunk of Solidified Amber.	Blood of Ancients	Lya and I agree on one thing: ""Blood of Ancients"" is almost certainly the sap from the great trees of the area. I should know - I brew with the stuff all the time. The most ancient tree of all is the one that Grand Empress Shek'zeer calls her home, now known as the Heart of Fear. Find some amber from that tree, and our brew should be complete. 
Weaken and capture Shan Kien at the Tomb of Shadows in Kun-Lai Summit.	Trapping the Leader	It is time to make our move. Go to the Tomb of Shadows, weaken him, and take him captive. I will stay here in case Garrosh arrives. He must be delayed so that we can take our prize before he destroys it in his anger. Hurry! 
Speak with Kota Kon at Kota Basecamp to ride her, then kill 100 Hozen along The Burlap Trail.	The Burlap Grind	Alright, it's time to take Kota Kon out for her ""walk.""We brewed two fresh pots of kafa just for her and she's all fueled up! 
Use the Ruining Fork on Iyyokuk the Lucid, then protect him until he is able to escape.	Fires and Fears of Old	We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing. The sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the Amber Hibernal, a mantid cave near their empress' palace. That must be the ""Blood of Ancients"" that the prophecy spoke of. Whatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, George. 
Defeat 20 Elite creatures on the Timeless Isle.	Path of the Mistwalker	You have heard the words of the celestials, but what did you learn on your path to the shrines? The wisdom of the pilgrimage is in its silence and simplicity. As you listen to the wind rustling in the trees, and note even the smallest butterfly, your mind is open to learning the deepest lessons the trials have to teach us. Perhaps you noticed the many great beasts that roam the island? Therein lies your trial. You have learned much from Pandaria, now let us put your knowledge to the test. 
Meet with Taoshi at Dampsoil Burrow.	Behind the Battlefront	This battlefront has been undermanned and unsupplied for too long during my absence in Kun-Lai. We need to get things back in order here before we can pick up the trail of the Sha of Hatred. Taoshi is my best. I've sent her north to investigate rumors of mantid that have somehow made it through the battlefront. I need someone I can trust to get out there and work with her to plug any holes in our defenses. If my reports on you are correct, I can trust you with this, right Mechanic? 
Listen to the Jade Serpent.	The Jade Serpent	You came to deliver a message to the Jade Serpent, right?<The little girl tilts her head up at you inquisitively.>I guess it's time you met her. 
Kill 200 Mantid and 3 Kunchong or Dread Behemoths while flying with Xaril the Poisoned Mind.	Dark Skies	The swarm begins, Wakener! The mantid amass at the Heart of Fear. Already they fill the skies with their wings and rend the earth with their claws. They shall not stop the dark march until their bodies are laid open and bleeding upon the ground. This we shall gladly do. We will attack them from above. While I fly, use my poisons to destroy their advance. Do not mix the two serums until you are ready to attack. The reaction can be quite... violent. Speak to me when you are ready to go. 
Speak with Emperor Shaohao.	The Last Emperor	From what I have gathered, this place used to be a tournament ground of sorts, where warriors from throughout Pandaria would show their prowess by following in the footsteps of their last emperor, Shaohao. I have heard that when Shaohao completed his trials, he became one with the land, and enveloped Pandaria in a thick mist, obscuring it from even our abilities to penetrate the passages of time. That sounds quite interesting, perhaps you should speak with him? 
Speak with the inhabitants in Zhu's Watch and find someone willing to talk to you.	What's Eating Zhu's Watch?	Pandaren always welcome travelers with open arms - and open kegs! But this town full of jerks! Everyone so busy sulking, they won't talk to Ken-Ken at all! Can you find someone in town who will talk to us? Maybe normal pandaren just hiding in the houses? 
Activate the Resonating Beacon in Amberglow Hollow.	Extending Our Coverage	The Klaxxi'va hear another paragon. His cries are weak and lost in darkness. The signal must be strengthened. There is a tower in Amberglow Hollow that has been silent for many years. It must sing; the Klaxxi demand it! This time I will go with you. You will help me repair it. Take the resonating crystal and meet me in Amberglow. 
Lead Mudmug back to Halfhill. If you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the Gilded Fan.	Barreling Along	No, no, no, don't you worry about pickin' 'em up. I can hold these here barrels. I may not be the handsomest pandaren, or the smartest, or any fun to be around in the slightest, but I'm stronger than a mushan beast. I'mma just need you to lead the way. 
Speak to Rivett east of Grookin Hill. Use his Methane Grenades to fend off the Jinyu attack.	Boom Goes the Doonamite!	It's an emergency! Looks like you stirred up a hornet's nest killin' all them fish-folk. They're conductin' a full-on counterattack on Grookin Hill! I was hopin' to get some R&D time, but we're gunna hafta put my methane-grenade theory to work right away! Meet me on the east side of the fort, and bring yer throwin' arm! 
Slay Milau.	The Thunder Below	Roars have been echoing out from inside the Guo-Lai Halls. The mogu have awakened some ancient beast, and it will not be long before they attempt to release it upon my men. Find your way to the Hall of the Serpent and slay the beast before it can be unleashed upon us. I would trust no other with such a dangerous and important task. 
Deliver the Pink Marmot, the Mogu Melon Twist, and the Rusty Dagger to the correct patron.	To Catch A Spy	Now, I could tell you who Connelly is, but that would be too easy! To catch a spy you have to think like a spy. You have to pass the test first! The small things can say a lot about a person. It's all in the details. I'm going to give you a drink to deliver. I will give you a small detail about something the recipient is wearing. From there it will be up to you. Be careful who you pick to give drinks to. People here tend to get pretty hostile if you give them the wrong order! 
Report to Chief Rikkitun at Rikkitun Village in Dread Wastes.	Promises of Gold	As soon as the creature died, a strange group of sprites appeared and took its pearl away. The sprites have a village nearby, called Rikkitun Village. Perhaps you should investigate. 
Take Xiao Tu to the smoke trails at Hatred's Vice.	Last Toll of the Yaungol	Ban has asked me to explore the village to determine what happened here. I noticed smoke rising up from the east, the west, northwest, and the south. I need someone I trust to watch my back. What do you say? Want to help me on my first scouting mission? 
Defeat the Jade Witch.	The Jade Witch	The Jade Witch must still have Shin. I... I can't do it! I don't want to see the witch. Can you please go talk to her and see if she has Shin? You're an adult, I don't think she would try to turn you into jade. 
Find Sheepie.	Oh Sheepie...	Sigh... you guessed it... Sheepie is gone... AGAIN. Stupid sheep! Gives me so much trouble! I hate to ask you again, but I promise this will be the last time. Can you find him for me? 
Speak with Lorewalker Cho in Dawn's Blossom. Speak to the flightmaster in Grookin Hill for passage.	Dawn's Blossom	Blood and Thunder! My axe hungers! We won't return to Orgrimmar until every last Alliance is purged from this land. I will train these natives myself, if I have to. One way or another, this land will be made ready for Horde settlement. In the meantime, their chief gave me this to pass on to you - a map and a message in some fancy script. Do what you must, but be quick about it. War is brewing... 
Use Shan'ze Ritual Stones to perform the Lightning Ritual, the Spirit Ritual, and the Primal Ritual at various locations across the Isle of Thunder, and then defeat the powerful opponents that are summoned forth.	Champions of the Thunder King	This island is riddled with lurking threats from three powerful groups, waiting for the chance to pounce on us. Masters of lightning, ancient and powerful spirits, and primal Zandalari monstrosities. If you can get your hands on some of the Shan'ze Ritual Stones scattered across the isle, you should be able to beckon these powerful opponents out of hiding and strike out at them. Find and destroy members of each group to keep them destabilized, and I will make it worth your time. 
Find an active Time-Lost Shrine and request a blessing from the celestials.	Wayshrines Of The Celestials	Many years ago, these grounds were a place where my people would come in pilgrimage. Here, they would listen to the words of the celestials, and meditate for many days. In their meditations, they found the fear, anger, despair, doubt, and violence that plagued their spirits. Before them would be a pathway to enlightenment. For each, the pathway would be different. For all of them, the pathway began with wisdom. Travel the island, as they did, and discover one of the lost wayshrines of the celestials. 
Use a Skyfire Gyrocopter to slay 60 of the Garrosh'ar troops and destroy 8 Garrosh'ar Shredders, and then sink the Bladefist Reaper and Stygian Scar.	Unleash Hell	I will NOT let the Horde gain a foothold on these shores before we do! If you're looking to jump into the fray, I've got a spare gyrocopter for you at the end of the runway. An attack run is already programmed in, all you have to do is concentrate on shooting. Unleash hell upon these orcs! 
Use Highly Explosive Yaungol Oil Barrels to kill 100 mantid or yaungol on the Gai-Cho Battlefield.	The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!	The mantid are our enemies. As are the yaungol at Fire Camp Gai-Cho. It is fortunate, then, that they are also each other's enemies. Mantid from Kri'vess constantly attack the Gai-Cho yaungol, who hold them off at their front gates. I want you to wreak havoc. ""Borrow"" some highly explosive oil barrels from camp Gai-Cho, and toss them down onto the battlefield from the air. I don't care which ones you kill, just kill a lot of them. 
Speak with Master Angler Ju Lien in Soggy's Gamble.	Mazu's Bounty	That was some amazing work you and the captain did out there, $p! It's an honor to have you on the crew. Oh! And Ju Lien survived! He swam ashore just after you started letting the harpoons fly. He was raving about some kind of gigantic egg or something that washed in with Jiao. Go check up on him, will you? He's probably hauled it out of the water by now. 
Defeat five Rare or Rare Elite creatures on the Timeless Isle.	Strong Enough To Survive	An island lost in time and yet it returns flourishing with life! Where did this island travel to? Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the Twisting Nether? There is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem. I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons. Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures. In death, we may find the clues we seek. 
Slay Captain Doren in Thunder Hold.	The Final Blow!	We've learned that their captain has barricaded himself in above us. The coward allowed his forces to die while he hid from our fury! Typical Alliance! No matter. He cannot delay his fate any longer. I will scale the walls with my marines while you lead a frontal assault up the ramps. Use your flare gun on munitions near the barricades to blast your way through. We will meet you up top and destroy this pathetic excuse for a captain together! 
Defeat 8 Fire Camp Ruqin Yaungols.	Traffic Issues	Yaungols are attacking our Burlap Trail. This is most bad fortune for grummles. We use that trail to carry supplies to the Serpent's Spine. Without supplies, the defenders of the wall are in danger. Grummles are packers and explorers, not fighters. Could you be a luckydo for us and stop the yaungol blockade? 
Collect 18 Huge Panther Fangs and 1 Jar of Pigment from Zhu Province.	Why So Serious?	Okay, so that not work. Well... it cheer Ken-Ken up! But pandaren still sad...We try another old hozen remedy - this time, we go back even further than gramma, way WAY back to ancient times. Hozen still do this sometimes... mostly at parties. Ken-Ken got woodworking to do - you bring him teeth! Not yours; big ones, like a panther would have! Oh, and some paint! Mei might know where to find. 
Find Thrall by using Vol'jin's Hearthstone.	Find Thrall!	<Vol'jin half opens an eye and begins to move his lips as if to speak. Though no sound comes, you decipher two words.>Find Thrall.<With an effort, Vol'jin thrusts a hearthstone into your hands and then passes out.> 
Kill sha near 10 Hopeless Monks or Acolytes to inspire them.	Sha Can Awe	The sha have the mysterious ability to evoke powerful, often overwhelming, emotional responses in their victims. As we fled the temple, senior members of the Crane Wing order stayed behind to cover our escape. They are no doubt being subjected to intense emotional trauma, and I fear they are not all strong enough to resist falling into despair.$p, we have to show them there is still hope! Show them that despair CAN be defeated! 
Use a Gunship Turret to kill 80 Thunder Hold troops and destroy 9 Thunder Hold cannons.	Paint it Red!	They shot out our engines and we floated here - HERE! Right in the firing line of the enemy! You know what to do, George. Get below decks and man those guns! Show these scum that they're in OUR line of fire! 
Find Anduin at the Shrine of Seven Stars. Speak to Fennie Hornswaggle at Lion's Landing for transportation.	Anduin's Plea	Ah, just the Mechanic I was looking for. I have received an urgent letter from the young Prince Anduin. He is playing host to his father, King Wrynn, and several other Alliance dignitaries at the Shrine of Seven Stars in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. According to his most recent correspondence, something bad is happening at the city. Please go at once and speak with him. I must settle some affairs here at Lion's Landing, but I will join you soon. Speak to Fennie if you'd like a ride to the Vale. 
Recover 8 Grummlepacks from Camp Broketooth or The Deeper.	No Pack Left Behind	The Broketooth hozen south of here killed all of my grummles. What is worse, their packages are undelivered. Fortune frowns on a grummlepack undelivered. Please, give my grummles peace on the great trail of beyond and bring their grummlepacks to me. I will see they are delivered. 
Slay 6 Dreadspinner Tenders and use the Shado-Pan Dragon Gun to destroy 20 Dreadspinner Eggs in the Terrace of Gurthan.	Nope	We're holding, but just barely. Anything you can do to stem the tide of dreadspinners coming up the wall would be a big help. Feel like tearing open spider eggs one at a time by hand? I didn't think so. Take one of our dragon guns and light it up down there. I wanna hear those puppies pop. 
Use Gunpowder Casks to explode the Kri'thik Weapons and the Kri'thik Supplies in Kri'vess.	Set the Mantid Back	Every day, the mantid build up munitions for use on their enemies. We cannot stop them, just you and I... but we can set them back.<Tai Ho hands you some explosives.>I need to keep a low profile. Would you do the honors? 
Travel through the Veiled Stair to Binan Village.	The Road to Kun-Lai	Ah! Greetings friend of Lorewalker Cho. I have a message for you.<The strange little creature hands you a battered scroll case.>The Lorewalker waits for you in Kun-Lai. Very dangerous to travel there, yes, very dangerous. Look for guides along the road to help you find your way. 
Report to Malik the Unscathed outside the Heart of Fear.	The Empress' Gambit	Grand Empress Shek'zeer has finally lost her patience with us. We have learned of an enormous army, massing in the shadows of the Heart of Fear, with orders to crush Klaxxi'vess. We have been fortunate to hold out this long, but we cannot survive a siege of this scale. Wakener, you have been invaluable to our efforts. Come, take your place on the field among we paragons. I will see you on the battlefield! 
Find the Mark of the Empress and the Heartroot of Kypari Kor.	Wood and Shade	""Rending daggers of the great ones shall be bound with WOOD and SHADE."" Hmm. I've learned a lot about the Kor'thik mantid in my time here. I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, Kor'vess. One is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen. These shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence. 
Bring Li Li to the Silken Fields, New Cifera, and Huangtze Falls.	Li Li's Day Off	Uncle Chen asked me not to get into any fights while he was away... but that doesn't mean I can't go exploring. Finally, a chance to look around Pandaria without stopping every forty-seven steps for another rest! You want to come with me? I'll bet there's all kinds of cool places we can visit, not too far away from here. 
Set the Yaungol Banner ablaze to summon Ur-Bataar, and then defeat him in combat.	Challenge Accepted	The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive. I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives. Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle. Only then will we be secure. 
Create a distraction in the camp and steal the Weathered Journal.	He Won't Even Miss It	I've noticed Garrosh and that Reliquary blood elf carrying around some sort of journal. The journal is never more than a stone's throw away. It must be important! If you can cause enough of a distraction, you may be able to swipe the journal off the table. These yaks might just do the trick. Give one of 'em a tap and they'll do the rest. Just be ready to move fast! 
Collect 5 Fish Cakes.	A Feast for the Senses	I have heard that you know a thing or two about cooking. As it so happens, serpents love to eat Fish Cakes. If you use your culinary skills and bring me 5 of these dishes, the cloud serpents around here will be very happy. 
Enter the Survival Ring and survive for 60 seconds without leaving.	Survival Ring: Blades	This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare. Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes. 
Rout the Mantid Swarm by slaying Akkolon, Shox'tik, the Manifestation of Terror, and 25 mantid subjugates.	The Wrath of Shek'zeer	The rest of the freed paragons are scattered around the Heart of Fear, fighting off the mantid swarm. They may need your help! 
Listen to Sully's report.	SI:7 Report: Fire From the Sky	Yeah, we found Amber, she's alive, and all that. That's about where the good news stops though. Let's see if I can pick up where ol' Rell left off... 
Find Warchief Hellscream at the Shrine of Two Moons. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	Rise Of An Empire	Warchief Garrosh Hellscream travels north with a squad of his most elite soldiers. Report to him with news of our continued victory against the Alliance. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation. 
Explore the Timeless Isle.	A Timeless Tour	You should first familiarize yourself with the island. Explore. Investigate anything that catches your interest. Return when you're done, and I'll reward you for whatever information you've gathered about this strange place. And do be careful! Monstrous beasts and supernatural creatures abound. 
Use the Shado-Pan Rope to descend into the Terrace of Gurthan and search for the fallen Shado-Pan marksman.	Falling Down	It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below. One of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down! We think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, Mechanic. If you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you? How about spiders? 
Kill 8 Osul Chargers.	A Foot in the Door	<Lord Taran immediately pins you down with his steely gaze.>Mechanic, you bear the marks of many a past battle. Good! We need more seasoned people like you to hold back the front. We've managed to secure a foothold here, but the yaungol are desperate to remove our presence. If you wish to prove your worth, go down the hill and show the yaungol that we will not back down. 
Use the Yak Lasso on Wild Townlong Yaks, then fight against them to see if they are suitable for Bluesaddle.	Pick a Yak	I can't find a single good yak here. ALL the yaks are bad! Some are too stinky, some too fight-y, others just scared. You look like a lucky Human. Here, take a lasso. See if you can find a good yak for me. 
Find Chen Stormstout at Binan Village. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	Someone You Should See	$p? It is good fortune I find you. Chen Stormstout says to give this to you and ask you to meet him at Binan Village of the Kun-Lai Summit. He found a friend of yours who needs much luck to get healthy. Chen say speak to Tak-Tak for fast travels. 
Speak to Xaril the Poisoned Mind. Kill 200 mantid and 3 kunchong while flying with him.	The Poisoned Mind	Before we return to Klaxxi'vess, I wish to look upon the empire. The Klaxxi Council told me that the enemy gathers outside the Empress's palace. My poisons are ready. What better way to announce my return than with death and destruction? Just be careful not to mix the two serums... at least not while you're holding the vessels. Speak to me when you are ready to fly. 
Use the Corpses of Tak Tak, Dak Dak, and Ko Ko on their respective altars.	A Monkey Idol	Before, grummles keep hozen from ravaging by bribing with food. But now the Broketooth hozen south of here have their big magic idols. The Ook of Dook has trained them to use their idols to get power from sacrifices. They are using them to kill grummles! You must destroy these idols! For every idol, there is a chief. Kill the chief and throw corpse on their altar. 
Speak with ""Soggy"" Su-Dao in Soggy's Gamble.	Meet the Cap'n	Alright, $p, I got another job for ya. You see that lion seal in the pen over there? Name's Dog. He's been Soggy's pet for years. Dog's acting up lately - I think he's getting restless in that pen. Why don't you go talk to Soggy and let him know. I'd say it's about time you meet the cap'n anyway. 
Speak with Chen Stormstout at the Thunderfoot Fields in the Valley of the Four Winds.	His Name Was... Stormstout	The land is ripe with rumors of an unusual pandaren monk whose power was matched only for his appetite for brew. He was traveling with his young niece who's mouth seems to get them into a lot of trouble. The locals say these two were headed to the Valley of the Four Winds. You should meet him! Just... watch out for that right hook. 
Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam and get a ride to Dawn's Blossom.	In Search of Wisdom	Lorewalker Cho came by and asked for you while you were gone. He needs your assistance urgently in the town of Dawn's Blossom to the north. For what reason, he did not say. Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam. He would be happy to send you there. 
Use the Bouncy Ball. Then, catch and return the ball to your hatchling 8 times.	Catch!	<The hatchling looks up at you with a bored, listless expression.>You have a feeling the serpent is tired of being cooped up all day. How about playing a little game of catch? 
Escort the cart and guides safely up Neverest Mountain.	Comin' Round the Mountain	The mountain pass is very dangerous. You need much luck to survive. Nephew Bentnail will show you the way. Perhaps today is a lucky day to travel though. Wind blows from the east; this is good sign. Grummles always travel best when east wind blows. Climb in the cart when you are ready to leave. 
Use a Hot Oil Cauldron to kill 80 mantid near the Gate of the Setting Sun.	Mantid Under Fire	The mantid are attacking again, and we're a bit short-handed up on the wall. In hopes that you'd help, I saved one of the more fun posts for you: the hot oil! It's a bit more violent and a bit less scandalous than it sounds. It's simple really. Get up on the wall, find one of the oil stations, and dump it on any of the mantid pouring up against the wall. It's very effective. 
Accompany Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver into the chamber below Klaxxi'vess.	Shadow of the Empire	You only understand part of our order. You are an outsider, and have been treated as such. It is no longer appropriate that we keep our secrets from you. There is something you should see. 
Recover 8 Stolen Supplies from Howlingwind Cavern.	Resupplying One Keg	If you're looking for the best supplies in Kun-Lai you've come to the right place! Oh sure, it looks a bit empty. Don't let appearances deceive you..Oh, who am I kidding?! Between the hozen attacks, and the sprites pillaging what few supplies we do get, my stock has dwindled to a dangerous level. If you could help me recover some of my supplies I should have enough to contribute to your journey. 
Use Sully's Flaregun to clear out the barricades and confront Ga'trul at the end of the dock.	The Right Tool For The Job	I've scouted the area and found no leads on the prince or Admiral Taylor. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere. Operations here are being led by an orc warlock; Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is trying to escape through a demonic circle. Put that flaregun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul. 
Enrage Chomp Chomp and then defeat the Ook of Dook.	The Leader Hozen	The time has come to face the Ook of Dook. We beat him, and the hozen won't have someone telling them to ravage. Here is the plan: Yakshoe will lead Tassle in to arena and scare away Chomp Chomp. Then, you sneak in and fight the Ook of Dook while his hozen are distracted by the yeti rampaging through their home. We'll meet you back at Kota Basecamp with a big reward. Good fortune to you, friend of grummles. 
Return Ji-Lu the Lucky's Lucky Virmen's Foot, Yak Shoe, Four Winds Clover, and Gold Coin.	They Stole My Luck!	My journeys through Kun-Lai have taught me two things. First, never sneak up on a sleeping yak. Second, having luck on your side is both necessary and hard to come by. The grummles believe in carrying a lucky trinket at all times. In my mind, if one trinket can sometimes bring luck, then many trinkets would guarantee it! After arriving in One Keg my lucky trinkets were stolen by those little menace sprites. I'd be truly grateful if you could retrieve them for me. 
Slay the corrupted paragon at Kypari Vor.	A Cry From Darkness	So, you survived the imperial clutches. You are... resilient. The Klaxxi hear another paragon to the north, among the sha-scorched roots of Kypari Vor. This one cries out in terror and agony. It cannot be saved. The Klaxxi want him put down. Go and defeat him or do not return here. 
Speak to Fei and travel to Valley of the Four Winds.	Moving On	Your journey in this land has already proven most eventful, traveler. And mine, it appears, is destined to continue for a time. A chain of events began when your people arrived here, and while some of those happenings are traumatic to behold, I feel there must be a larger purpose behind your presence. For now it is wisest that you leave this place and explore Pandaria's other regions. Speak to me when you are ready to leave. 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	Better Dead than Dread	I am sure many of our associates will be requesting your services after your victory here. But I have received a request for aid from our defenders at the wall along the Dread Wastes. If you would assist them, then take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li. 
Use a Rappelling Rope to reach the ground.	Touching Ground	Nazgrim has taken command of the ground assault and has requested that you be sent to meet up with him immediately. We have several rappelling ropes setup near the guns. Fastest way down you're going to find, save the one that ends poorly. 
Collect a Scroll of Spiritbinding Rites from the yaungol at Deadtalker's Plateau.	The Deadtalker Cipher	We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers. For so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors. From a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened. 
Speak with Mishi to travel to the Path of Conquerors. From there find Shin Whispercloud at Whispercloud Rise.	Fisherman's Tale	The villagers of Zouchin know the coast better than anyone in Kun-Lai. If the Zandalari are hiding on one of the islands, they will know. Mishi will take you as far as Emperor's Path. I will go ahead to speak with the village elders. Follow the path to Whispercloud Rise. Shin Whispercloud will help you reach the village. 
Speak with Miss Fanny at Stoneplow. Then, with her help, defeat the Mantid Colossus.	The Savior of Stoneplow	That commander speaks hastily. He has the weapon he needs to win this battle. He has YOU.""But it's too hard,"" you might say. You would be wrong. It is not too hard. NOTHING IS TOO HARD. Go now, George. Go, and save Stoneplow! 
Travel to Klaxxi'vess at the center of the Dread Wastes. You may speak with Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver in the Terrace of Gurthan for a ride, or travel on your own.	The Klaxxi Council	I must report to the Klaxxi. They would not have woken me unless the situation were dire. You have not been entirely useless. For that, I will spare your life. The council may even find a use for you. 
Ask Chen Stormstout to taste Ella's Brew.	A Worthy Brew	There's one final person who needs to taste my brew. I've heard that he's traveled far and wide, and tasted drinks from all over the world. He happens to be in town, and I'd like to know what he thinks of my skills. 
Help Lao-Chin the Iron Belly hold the far side of the Dusklight Bridge.	The Taking of Dusklight Bridge	Let's press these insects back across the bridge and break their spirits! Follow my lead. 
Use Explosive Barrels found in Fire Camp Ordo to destroy the East, South, and West Oil Rigs.	Barrels of Fun	I love blowing stuff up. It's in my blood! The yaungol to the west at Fire Camp Ordo have a ton of explosive barrels just lying around. I say we put them to good use and destroy their oil-pumpin' machines while having some fun! 
Escort Thrall to the Echo Isles.	The Horde Is Family	This hearthstone was part of a conversation Vol'jin and I shared a long time ago. He believes his people are in danger. I don't know what all has transpired in my absence, but I can at least do this for my friend. Come, $p, travel with me to the Echo Isles. We must make sure that the Darkspear are safe. 
Defeat Shai Hu. He can be found at the Waterspeaker's Sanctuary, the island in the center of Inkgill Mere in Kun-Lai Summit.	The Fall of Shai Hu	I can hear the voice of the Mere - it has been purified. But, this chapter in my people's history will never be closed - not until we defeat Shai Hu. He has retreated to the central island in the Mere, corrupting our holiest of sites. Beware - he is strong. But, after all we have done, I am confident we will be stronger. 
Return the Glowing Amber to Kaz'tik the Manipulator.	Falling to Pieces	Why would the saurok have amber? More importantly, why would Oracle Hiss'ir be so protective of it? It is unlikely this came from the heavily guarded Zan'vess, so where did it come from? Perhaps the Klaxxi will know what to make of it. 
	A Dish for Fish	 
Use Ken-Ken's Mask on 5 Ik'thik Wing Commanders, then defeat the Manifestations of Fear that come out.	The Mantidote	<Mei motions towards the battlefield.>You see those huge mantid commanders out there? They have a strange aura about them. It reminds me of the sadness we saw at Zhu's Watch. Perhaps... they're under the influence of the sha, too? I kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from Yi-Mo. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back. 
Slay 15 Thunder Hold troops.	Finish Them!	We've softened them up. Now it's time to finish them off! That fortress must be cleansed of Alliance, and we've got nowhere to keep any prisoners.<The hint of a smile crosses Nazgrim's face.>You know what to do, George. The cowards will run if you give them the chance. See that you don't! 
Use the Rancher's Lariat to lasso and defeat a Great White Plainshawk.	A Lesson in Bravery	<Master Shang speaks to his shepherd boy.>Francis, you need to show bravery! You have everything it takes to make a great shepherd, except the courage to face your fears!<He looks over to you.>You, stranger. You helped the rest of my family. Francis is like a second son to me. Show my apprentice what it means to lack fear. Use this rope to lasso and defeat one of the great white hawks above us.<Shang points to the sky, looks at Francis, and leaves.> 
Meet up with Chen Stormstout at Halfhill.	Chen's Resolution	You know what? I don't have to take this. I'll show that Uncle Gao what it means to be a real brewer. I'll brew the best beer he's ever tasted, with ingredients I've never even used before. I'm Chen Stormstout, and I'm the best brewer alive. 
Recover a Wild Ptrerrorwing Hatchling.	A Wing to Fly On	I've just received a report that another young pterrorwing has been spotted in the Diremoor. We need to recover as many of these as we can find. They may be the key to flying on this island. 
Slay Ga'trul.	The Fall of Ga'trul	Alright <lad/lass>. We've taken enough jabs at this warlock army... now it's time to cut off the head. Ga'trul's back there, in that big ol' temple ruin. Give him a good what-for, and the Horde will have lost its last stake here in Pandaria. 
Consume a Ripe Crispfruit, Sand-Covered Egg, Charged Crystal, Huge Yak Roast, Roasted Seed, or Fire Poppy on the Timeless Isle.	Timeless Nutriment	As you have surmised, the flora and fauna of this island are quite unusual. Not all explanations are mysterious, however. Sometimes, we must listen to the land, to hear the tales of the world around us. Have you considered that the creatures of this island grew to such proportions simply from the nutriment of the land you walk upon? You will find nutriment in abundance throughout the island: ripe fruits, eggs, meat, flowers, nuts, and even the stones themselves. Eat, and discover the power of the land. 
Stand by and help Chen Stormstout with his brew.	The Emperor	We have everything we need. It's time to start brewing. Pay attention, George... you might learn a thing or two. 
Rescue Jin Warmkeg, Ya Firebough, Old Lady Fung, and Sya Zhong.	Holed Up	Oh, thank you! There's no way I could have made it back on my own. Come to think of it, there must be others around Firebough Nook that need to be rescued. Shall we go collect them and then head to the safety of Shado-Pan Fallback? 
Collect a Korune Codex from the Korune Spellweaver.	The Korune	These terracotta wardens are fearsome, but not nearly as horrifying as the creature that we found at the top of the ruins. Some of our surviving scouts reported seeing some kind of mogu spellweaver on the highest rise to the north. He practices a type of magic unlike any other we have seen. We must learn whatever we can from this creature. Slay him, and bring me anything you find. 
Exorcise the Sha of Despair energy from Yi-Mo Longbrow in Zhu's Watch.	Zhu's Despair	Hmm... Is that Yi-Mo kid over there?<Ken-Ken squints against the increasing torrents of rain.>It is! He's at the well, and he's not lookin' so good. Ken-Ken got a bad feeling about this... 
Fly through 10 Race Flags at the Checkpoints floating above the Mistveil Sea.	Flight Training: In Due Course	Now that you have learned the basics of the race, you should go learn the course. Explore the spires and collect a race flag from each of the checkpoints. Fly through each checkered flag to collect it. 
Slay Dmong Naruuk, the shaman who holds Orbiss hostage.	A Spear Through My Side, A Chain Through My Soul	My fate is sealed. The yaungol put this spear in my side. The wound will kill me. The yaungol hold me in place with their twisted, corrupted magic. The indignity of it hurts worse than my spear-wound. My death, I cannot stop. My imprisonment... you may be able to help me with this. 
	A Dish for Old Hillpaw	 
Find the martial arts students, then help them defeat an Ik'thik Bloodrager, Egg-Matron, Tendon-Slicer, and Fearmonger.	Students No More	Those five students - the ones who were looking for the Hidden Master - they went up to the front lines, alone. I'd send Shado-Pan to aid them, but I haven't got any left. There's dangerous creatures up there near the wall. If you find those students, make sure that they haven't fallen to any of them. 
Defeat 3 rare enemies while the Mogu are invading the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Champions of the Mogu	These lesser clans warring with each other in the Vale need to be taught their place. Seek out their champions and eliminate them. Show them that only the Rajani have rightful claim here! 
Assist with Aethas and Rommath's experiment.	What's in the Box?	We are trying to uncover the secrets of one of the mogu artifacts Garrosh insisted we investigate. It is proving most difficult, as anyone who probes it magically is greatly affected by raw, negative emotions. I called in the assistance of Arch-mage Aethas of the Sunreavers in the hopes that he and Rommath could crack this puzzle. They asked for you specifically - apparently you have some relevant experience? Go to the chamber below Farstrider Square east of here and see if you can assist them. 
Find Suna Silentstrike.	The Point of No Return	One of our rangers reported seeing Suna up the hill to the northwest. I am relieved to find her safe. I had feared what she would do in her grief. Would you go speak to her on my behalf? Take this totem with you. If you encounter any danger along the way, you may find it useful. 
Kill 15 Enraged Jinyu.	Enraged Vengeance	<The Swordmistress does not look well. There's a darkness to her eyes uncharacteristic of the pandaren.>I don't think I've ever been as... as furious as now. What betrayal! I fought them off when they attacked, killed a few here, but Merchant Shi is too much of a coward to let me go and finish the job! You, do it for me. Kill them. Kill them all. 
Find Muskpaw Jr. in Pranksters' Hollow.	The Missing Muskpaw	What the heck are you supposed to be? A Mechanic? Never heard of one of them. You here to help or to steal my yaks? Look, if yer' insistin' on helpin' out, go find my boy. He got himself grabbed by a bunch of sprites and probably doesn't even know we lost the ranch. They dragged him off to Pranksters' Hollow south east of here. Go rescue him an' I'll see about giving you a reward of some sort. 
Lure Kobai into the Blinding Rage Trap, steal the Mask of Malevolent Fury from him, and then defeat Malevolent Fury.	Unmasking the Yaungol	Simply killing Kobai will accomplish nothing, as he is possessed by a particularly powerful and destructive Sha - Malevolent Fury. You will use the trap I have fashioned from the Blinding Rage Essences you brought. Lure him into the trap, and then steal his mask. Once you put it on, Malevolent Fury will appear and attempt to take control of you. Defeat him, and we will have made a victory of this tragic situation. You can find him to the north of the retreat, where he taunts us in insane rage. 
Speak to Taoshi to enter the Thunder King's Citadel. Inside, provide her with a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen to begin the timed raid on his treasure convoy.	Treasures of the Thunder King	My scouts have returned with word that more of the treasures from Lei Shen's tomb are being brought up into the citadel. We have access to a secret sewer entrance, but a door bars us from intercepting the shipment. If we're going to succeed in this raid, we will need a key that only the most trusted of Lei Shen's forces carry. If you get your hands on such a key, bring it to me. You can keep whatever spoils you steal from our raid. I simply want to see that this shipment never makes it to Lei Shen. 
Kill 10 Korune Mogu.	Clearing a Path	First thing's first. If we're going to take the leader captive, we'll need to thin the numbers of his agents. Be careful. These mogu are particularly dangerous - they appear to be manipulating the sha in ways we haven't seen before. 
Go to Ihgaluk Crag and slay a Skumblade saurok.	Skin of the Saurok	Ihgaluk Crag is a dangerous place. Luckily, you have the magic of the Sunreavers behind you. I can transform you into a saurok. I will perform the first half of the illusion on you now. Afterwards, you should go directly to Ihgaluk Crag and slay one of the Skumblade saurok. Once you have done this, I will contact you and complete the second half of the illusion. 
Speak to Thelonius at the Cradle of Chi-Ji in the Krasarang Wilds.	Challenge At The Temple of the Red Crane	The Temple of the Red Crane still reels from the aftermath of the sha's presence, and has only recently gathered to rebuild and retrain its warriors. If you wish to help at the temple, speak to Thelonius at the Cradle of Chi-Ji. 
Slay mantid in Kri'vess so Tai Ho can look for clues on their bodies.	The Motives of the Mantid	Mechanic. You may be of assistance. The Shado-Pan wishes to know why the mantid are attacking so violently. We have our suspicions, but we cannot be sure. Furthermore, we do not want the mantid to know that we are investigating them. That's where you come in. I need you to kill the mantid of Kri'vess, in the north. I will lurk behind you in the shadows, and search for clues on their bodies. 
Slay Mage-Commander Zuros, then escape from Dalaran.	One Last Grasp	We've looked everywhere he's likely to be, except for one place: the Violet Citadel. Find out if Archmage Aethas is being held within the citadel, George. We may get lucky. If not... at least we saved a number of lives today. 
Carry the Torch of Strength to the gates of the Temple of the White Tiger without it extinguishing.	The Torch of Strength	Xuen has this challenge he says helps ""refine strength."" I am starting to think the word ""strength"" means something different to him than the rest of us. Here, take this torch to the top of the gates of the temple. If you can get it there without the torch being extinguished, you pass the challenge. Whatever you do, do not try carrying the torch on a mount. It will blow out if you do. Trust me on that one. 
	Pristine Firestorm Egg	 
Kill 15 Sha-Infested Yaungol.	The Defense of Shado-Pan Fallback	I sent for reinforcements from the Shado-Pan Monastery, but have heard nothing back. We have already lost the town. A few lucky villagers may have survived, but we are pinned down here. We do not have time to entertain strangers. If you can fight, help my men defend this tower. If not, leave, for you will not survive long here. 
Find the document Legacy of the Korune in the Valley of the Emperors, and collect the Sealed Korune Artifact and Korune Orders from Korune Mogu.	Legacy of the Korune	I'm not prepared to throw away more of our people fighting against an enemy we don't know or understand. See if you can find any clues in the area as to who exactly these ""Korune"" mogu are. A contingency in case this operation doesn't go as planned. 
Return to Stormspeaker Qian in the Silent Sanctuary in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Return to Mistfall	We have done all we can here. We know how much the mogu are a clear threat. The forge is in great danger of falling into their hands if we lose our hold on the Vale. Let us return to Mistfall and report to the Rajani. They will want to know what we are up against. 
Kill 12 Muckscale Flesheaters and the Muckscale Serpentus.	The Scent of Blood	I'm afraid that I wet my hands with saurok blood while you were away. I'm sorry, but I could not help myself. Now, watch them attack me. Pitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come? No, these... saurok... will crumple before me like paper before the flame! I shall show you my might, Wakener. Fight alongside me and see. Here they come! 
Burn 10 Kor'thik Fleetwing corpses.	Choking the Skies	Nurong wants me to pass out torches for burning the bodies. The flying mantid are fragile, and won't last long in the hot smoke. 
Investigate Kor'vess.	Once More Into Kor'vess	You found this on a member of the swarm? It seeps with corruption... and with power. We could be faced with a serious threat if the rest of the mantid's amber is similarly corrupted. Far to the west in the Dread Wastes lies Kor'vess, a large kypari tree that provides the swarm with most of its amber. From there, we can determine just how much of their stores have been infused with the energy of the Old Gods. I will meet you closer to the tree. 
Use the Incantation of Gura in the Hall of the Exalted, then defeat Gura the Reclaimed.	Into the Crypts	The Reliquary is having a field day out here, literally! Every day, the researchers find more relics to study and catalog. Recently, one of our adventurers found this scroll at the Court of Bones. I believe that this incantation can be used to call beyond the grave. And if my Mogu is up to date, I'd say you should use it in the last room in the Hall of the Exalted. Would you be willing to test out my theory? 
Speak to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum in The Jade Forest.	The Order of the Cloud Serpent	The Order of the Cloud Serpent is always searching for talented riders. If you wish to follow our way, you should speak to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum in the Jade Forest. I wish you luck, Human. 
Speak to Elder Sage Wind-Yi outside the entrance to the Temple of the Jade Serpent. Speak to Kitemaster Shoku for a kite ride to the temple.	The Temple of the Jade Serpent	You've done us a huge favor here, traveler. Now that we have enough jade to complete the statue, we should send word of our progress to Yu'Lon, the Jade Serpent. When you arrive, speak to Elder Sage Wind-Yi outside the entrance to the Temple of the Jade Serpent. If you wish to speed your journey, speak to Kitemaster Shoku. I'm sure he can spare an extra kite for you. 
Fly with Taoshi on the Shado-Pan Kite.	Heart of the Swarm	We need to know what we're up against. Before we return to the Serpent's Spine, we should take the opportunity to scout the swarm. I will fly us over the Heart of Fear. We should be able to survey Empress Shek'zara's forces from above. Then we can determine the extent to which N'Zoth has bolstered their ranks with his own. 
Challenge Hawkmaster Nurong, and then defeat him in combat at Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes.	The Challenger's Ring: Hawkmaster Nurong	You've really been building up respect with the Shado-Pan, George. Nurong's interested in trying out his skills against you. The good news is, if you win, I'll allow him to go with you on your missions. The bad news is, I really don't think you'll win. 
Rescue Shademaster Kiryn, Rivett Clutchpop, Shokia, and Sergeant Gorrok from Honeydew Glade.	Regroup!	They have an airbase! I have underestimated this Alliance Captain for the last time. So many good warriors lost...There must have been a few survivors who were able to bail during the crash. We need every able-bodied fighter we can get. Find as many survivors as you can in the forest below, and I will investigate the wreckage itself. Rally everyone together at the nearby village for a counter-attack. 
Confront 6 Sha-Touched Grunts.	A Gathering Storm	If General Nazgrim sent you, then I trust you are capable of discretion. When I arrived here, I found Garrosh... experimenting... with some ancient power that he found in the mountains to the north. He believes that this ""sha"" can strengthen our soldiers. Unfortunately, so far the results have been quite the opposite. Our troops are erupting into random violence. Go and interrogate them. If they threaten you, be prepared to defend yourself. 
Use the Vision of Time in the Siege of Orgrimmar.	Seeking Fate	I have not been completely forthright with you, despite all that you have done to aid the Timewalkers. I cannot tell you everything, not yet, but know this - there is a traitor amongst us. Tell no one of your mission today, and take caution around any of my flight while you hold the Vision of Time. Quickly now, return to the Siege of Orgrimmar once more and use the hourglass. And be safe. 
Report to Admiral Rogers at Paw'don Village in the Jade Forest.	Onward and Inward	""Sha"" energy, hm? Tread carefully, George - there's a hidden darkness to this continent. We'll stay behind to mop up the rest of the Horde, but we need you to continue with the main mission: the rescue of Captain Taylor, and the retrieval of Prince Anduin. Our aerial scouts think we've found the wreckage of the flagship near Paw'don Village. Go there and report to Admiral Rogers for instructions. You are welcome to use my gyrocopter. 
Kill 5 Spirit-Bound Sentries and then use the Resonance Crystal to capture the Zandalari Spirits trapped within.	They All Fall Down	The Zandalari do not tolerate weakness in their ranks, Mechanic. Those that are deemed weak are often sacrificed in barbaric ceremonies. The victims' spirits are captured and entombed within the sentries you see guarding the grounds. I wish to study their essence. For this I will need your help. Take this resonance crystal and siphon the spirits from the sentry corpses. Do not allow them to escape! 
Help Koro Mistwalker escort a group of refugees from the Temple of the Red Crane to Crane Wing Refuge. Speak with Koro first to begin.	Unsafe Passage	As we say at the temple: ""Never fight a tiger with a hozen on your back.""We will deal with the sha, but first we must see to the more immediate... nuisance.<Koro slams the writhing saurok HARD against the stone.>Groups of refugees from the temple are heading for a camp to the north, but they're being ambushed by saurok. Help me see the next group to the camp and we'll figure out our next move from there. 
Complete the ""Brewing Storm"" Scenario.	Blanche's Boomer Brew	Can you smell it in the air? A storm is brewing! And so am I! Meet me at the hilltop when the storm hits and together we'll whip up a keg of my most famous brew. Can I count on your help? 
Search the Abandoned Wreckage for supplies.	One Traveler's Misfortune	Did you have to throw our supplies at them?! Why not use your weapon? Maybe fancy spells or kicks? Why the supplies?!Now we don't have enough to last us, especially with Nephew Bentnail here. His appetite is like a yeti's! You threw it, you get us more. There is wreckage down the path. Maybe you will find supplies there. 
Use the Portal to the Purple Parlor in Lion's Landing and meet with Anduin Wrynn.	The Kirin Tor	$p, King Varian has asked that I send you after his son to Dalaran. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there. These ""Sunreavers"" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. Now that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city. Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin. 
Speak with Kai Wanderbrew, Master Windfur, and Peiji Goldendraft in Dawn's Blossom.	Welcome to Dawn's Blossom	Cho's off on another one of his adventures, and this one requires a big order of jade. I'm going to have to call in some favors. How 'bout in the meantime you introduce yourself to some of the locals. Kai Wanderbrew is a good guy to know, as is Master Windfur. Oh, and say hi to Peiji Goldendraft up at the inn. Between the three of them, you should get the feel for life in Dawn's Blossom. 
Kill the mantid of the Sra'thik Incursion so that Tai Ho can search their bodies for pieces of Niuzao's statuette.	Niuzao's Price	Niuzao owns a statuette which he values greatly: a small icon, in his image, sculpted by one of his long-since fallen sentinels. This statuette was recently stolen by the Sra'thik mantid, and taken to their encampment to our north. Bring back this statuette. Then we will give you - and your Shado-Pan associate - the answers you seek. 
Speak with Lin Tenderpaw at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.	Tian Monastery	People come from all over Pandaria to train at the Tian Monastery, just to the north of here. Probably because they never turn anybody down. They'll accept jinyu, hozen... or even a foreign Human like you! My childhood friend, Lin, just joined the monastery's order a few weeks ago. If you're interested in learning how our monks train, maybe you should go talk with her! 
Hold off the Zan'thik while Rik'kal wakens.	The Dissector Wakens	You are... not like the others...I hear the Klaxxi calling... <cough>I just need a moment. 
Collect Zin'Jun's belongings from the Hozen Groundpounders. If you lose Zin'Jun, speak to him at the Ascent of Swirling Winds.	Cryin' My Eyes Out	I coulda taken out da whole lot of 'em, mon. Shot 'em one by one, den played dead when dey be gettin' close. Fell for it every time, dey did - well almost every time...One of 'em finally got wise. Called my bluff. Before I knew it, dey was usin' my eyes as marbles. Ran off with my goods an' left me here ta die, da savages...Help me, mon. Lemme die wit my dignity intact. 
Find the Bottom Fragment of Lei Shen's Tablet and restore the Tablet of Thunder.	Stealing Their Thunder King	Our only hope is to find the Thunder King's remains before they do. He must be buried within the Tomb of Conquerors. Getting to his remains will not be easy, George. The tomb will no doubt be defended by guardians and other unfriendly surprises intended to ward off thieves. Once inside we will need to figure out where his remains have actually been placed. 
Plant the Cleverly Disguised Bugs in the large tent, near the small tents, and in the supplies.	Bugging Out	I've managed to plant a few bugs around the camp, but there could always be more. I disguised the bugs to look like statues. They blend in perfectly with the other artifacts lying around. Your disguise should allow you to move freely around the camp. Just don't go near the dog and don't linger around Garrosh! Nero and Garrosh will see through your disguise. If you get caught I can't help you. I can't compromise the mission! 
Report to Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	Mists of Pandaria: To Pandaria!	You are hereby ordered to present yourself at Grommash Hold immediately. We have received word of a new, resource-rich continent in the south, and we intend to send you and a small contingent of soldiers to claim it for the Horde. 
Collect a rubbing of the Shen Dynasty Tablet, the Wai Dynasty Tablet, and the Qiang Dynasty Tablet in the Tomb of Shadows.	The Tomb of Shadows	Given the artifacts you found on the altar, I would guess they were attempting to perform a Spiritbinding ritual. Most of the texts involving Spiritbinding were locked away in the Tomb of Shadows. Perhaps we will find the answers we seek there. Look for anything that might help us. You'll find the tomb on the first rise closest to the ritual altar. 
Collect 30 Honeycomb from Angry Honeykeepers in The Arboretum.	Sweet as Honey	<The hatchling scampers about, then whines and whimpers.>From the cloud serpent's behavior, you have a hunch that it wants a sweet treat. The fragrant trees in The Arboretum are home to many honey hives. It will be a simple matter to collect combs from the nearby honeykeepers. 
Find Jian, Ling, and Smelly.	Back to the Sty	I try to keep an eye on my stock, but every once in a while some of them sneak away. With all the confusion these virmen are causing, I may have let my guard down for a few moments, and some of my pigs escaped. Care to look for them? I'd start by looking down the hill, to the west. 
Obtain 10 Meadow Marigolds and 40 Vials of Animal Blood.	Yellow and Red Make Orange	Uncle Chen says we're going to help this guy out with his virmen problem. Fine by me! I LOVE messing with virmen. Here's the plan: we're going to paint some turnips orange, and then we'll try to convince the virmen that they're carrots. This can only end in comedy. I'll gather turnips. You find something that we can use to make edible orange paint. 
Deliver the Scavenged Jade to Lorewalker Cho at Emperor's Omen. Speak with Toya in Dawn's Blossom for a ride.	All We Can Spare	Alright, I called in every favor I could. Here's what we got. Cho must be on to something big! Lemme know when you're ready to go see him - I got a ride all prepared for ya. 
Locate Zin'jun somewhere in the Ascent of the Swirling Winds.	Seeking Zin'jun	Rivett claims to have seen Zin'jun abandon ship with the rest of the survivors. That means he's still out there somewhere. We can't leave him behind. He could be injured or worse yet, captured! Go track down Zin'jun and bring him back. 
Speak with Taran Zhu at the Longying Outpost in Townlong Steppes.	Beyond the Wall	We received word the Shado-Pan have begun a counter attack in to Townlong Steppes. It sounds like they are going after the root of the yaungol invasion. The pandaren have not traveled in force in to Townlong for thousands of years. The Shado-Pan are strong and brave, but they are also proud and few. They will need help from heroes like yourself. Can you travel through the Gate of Winter's Blossom in the northwest? Find the Shado-Pan leaders and lend your help and experience? 
Speak with Farmhand Ko and Elder Shiao in Kun Lai Summit.	Eastwind Rest	I am injured, but we can't stop here. The hozen were... unreliable. The pandaren would be much better allies. You have seen the refugees in this village, and heard of the yaungol invasion, no? Well, we've heard from the locals that Eastwind Rest, a nearby village, was destroyed by the Yaungol. Apparently some survivors have gathered along the road out of town. Go. Take the road west. Gather the survivors. We'll help them rebuild. Then, they will see the advantage of joining the Horde! 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	Better Off Dread	It's time we go to the source, George! Shado-Pan marksmen keep a constant watch over the Dread Wastes from the top of the Serpent's Spine. They would surely welcome the aid of a skilled Mechanic such as yourself. Seek out Bowmistress Li atop the Serpent's Spine on the border of Dread Wastes. 
Pull 100 weeds from Gai Lan's field. You can pull weeds while mounted.	Weed War	You want some hops? I've got plenty in the shed out back. I'll gladly share some with you... if you'll help me weed my field. Now ""hop"" to it! Get it? 
Report to General Nazgrim at Strongarm Airstrip in the Jade Forest.	Nazgrim's Command	You have a comfortable base of operations, no Alliance around for miles, and a few Horde veterans by your side. It looks like it's time to start painting this continent red. General Nazgrim should know where to start. 
Return 8 spirits to their remains at the Deadtalker Plateau in Townlong Steppes.	Spirit Dust	The spirits that the Yaungol are entrapping from the remains of their ancestors still have a bit of the essence of life within them. If you defeat the spirits in battle, you can collect essence from the spirits as dust, and then return it to the corpses in the area, which will send the spirits, finally, to the next life. This is the only way to set right what the Deadtalkers have done. It will also help keep us safe. 
Check in with Shademaster Kiryn, Rivett Clutchpop, Shokia, and Riko.	Gauging Our Progress	The time for war is at hand, George! We've been training these natives non-stop since you left, and I believe they're as good as they're going to get. See for yourself. Check in with the others and return with your findings. We must rely on our enemy being somehow... even less prepared. 
Find Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron at Mogujia. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	To Mogujia	Throm-ka, Mechanic. While we were busy defending our foothold here, Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron led a research expedition north into Kun-Lai Summit. Unfortunately, it seems they have encountered trouble. Warchief Garrosh Hellscream has already departed to lend his assistance, but he will require additional reinforcements. Go northward into the mountains of Kun-Lai. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation. 
Use Nazgrim's Grog to destroy the Alliance Camp atop the Scenic Overlook.	Burning Down the House	Look, George! These Alliance dogs built a camp up on the ridge. Here, take my grog. Let's make a fire they can see from Stormwind! For the Horde! 
Use the Lorewalker's Notebook to gather notes about the faceless, k'thir, and fleshbeasts in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Aggressive Notation	Even given the Sha's origins with the Old Gods, we in Pandaria still know very little of them. I would like to take this opportunity to add whatever information I can about them to the archives of the Lorewalkers. Of course, that becomes a bit problematic when they're trying to kill us. That doesn't seem to be a problem for you, though. Could you do me a favor and jot down some notes about what you encounter out there? It could help a great deal towards understanding what we're fighting. 
Find your ""Friend from Silvermoon"" at the Valley of Emperors. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	To the Valley!	This sealed communication was sent for you, along with urgent orders to travel to the Valley of Emperors in Kun-Lai Summit. This looks serious. I'd not delay if I were you. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation. 
Collect Epoch Stones from creatures on the Timeless Isle.	Empowering the Hourglass	The hourglass gives us glimpses into the streams of time we once walked as easily as a well-worn path. Gather additional epoch stones, so that we may continue to use the power of the hourglass to delve into the mysteries of the timeways. The future depends on it. 
Kill 8 Slitherscale Rippers or Slitherscale Eggdrinkers.	Beating the Odds	At first, the Slitherscale were too frightened to approach the wild serpents. Then, I caught them snatching the eggs under the cover of night. Now, they are slaughtering adults and hatchlings alike! If we do not do something, these gentle creatures will be completely wiped out. Then there won't even be an Order of the Cloud Serpent to join! Go and slay these vile Slitherscales, and then we will talk. 
Help Jaina discover who took the Divine Bell, and where they took it. You may speak with Seamus Goldenkicks in Lion's Landing to be ported to Darnassus.	Tracking the Thieves	We WILL get to the bottom of this. George, you're coming with me. We'll search every inch of this city if we have to, but we'll find out how they took the bell... and where. I'm picking up traces of arcane magic here... we need to follow the trail! 
Burn 8 Mummified Remains.	Ashes of the Enemy	The mogu here at the Court of Bones are bolstering their army by resurrecting the spirits of their dead. We cannot allow them to revive their fallen warriors. Take this torch and burn any mummified corpses that you can find. We will destroy our enemies before they have a chance to rise. 
Find High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof at the Shrine of Two Moons. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	Echoes of Thunder	Ah, George, we meet again. I have heard some wondrous news. High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof of the tauren has arrived here on Pandaria. He meets with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron now, at the Shrine of Two Moons in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. He sent me a strange request - to send him a loyal champion of the Horde, capable of combat... and discretion. I can think of none better to send than you. Speak to Tak-Tak if you seek transport. 
Scoop toad eggs from 8 Gurgling Toadspawn on the top level of the Pools of Purity.	Bottletoads	Have you heard about the crisis we're having at the pools? Toads have moved in and are spawning like crazy! It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers. Coincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it ""Bottletoads"" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock. If you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs. Into this bottle. For me. Just look for bubbles and scoop right in! 
	Short-Supply Reward	 
Use the Gut Bombs at Murky Bank and collect 5 Exploded Slickies.	Boom Bait	There. I've plastered your bird guts over my explosives. I call 'em Gut Bombs, patent pending. Since you made friends with these fellas, how about you do the honors? Just light the fuse and throw 'em down by the shoreline! 
Locate the Divine Bell. You may use the Silvermoon Charm to return to Fanlyr if you get in trouble.	The Darnassus Mission	The Divine Bell is in the city. We don't want to cause a scene, we just want the artifact. I need you to find a way in, WITHOUT getting caught. That means no mounts, no flying, no fighting. I can provide aid. I will magically cloak you, so you may move with stealth. I will also give you a small charm that you may use to return to safety, should you get in trouble. Now go, George. Go, locate the bell, and tag it to be teleported back with you. 
Kill 6 Osul Sharphorns.	First Assault	Now that we have had time to assess our enemies' weaknesses, it is time for us to deal the yaungol a direct blow. Go and confront the Osul Sharphorn up the mesa to the west. Let them know that we are here, and that we are not scared of their threats. 
Recover 20 Krik'thik Limbs.	Rummaging Through the Remains	I do have another task for you, George, though it's a might grim. I really need to get to the bottom of this mantid poison, but to do that, I need more information directly from the source. While you're down on the southern battlefield, could you bring me back some mantid limbs so that I can examine their intact poison glands. 
Get the Yeti Shackle Key from Cho Cho the Wicked and release Old Poot Poot.	Hozen Love Their Keys	The hozen have a yeti! They call it Old Poot Poot and keep it at the back of their cave. Hozen are normally scared of yeti, but now they feed it grummles. They have a Hunter Chief, Cho Cho the Wicked. Can you see if he has a key on him to the yeti shackles? Bad fortune for hozen if a yeti is loose in their fort. 
Collect 100 Kafa'kota Berries from Kota Peak. They can be found in bushes growing on the mountainside or piled up in the yeti caves.	Kota Blend	Kota Peak is famous for its kafa bushes - no other can survive at this elevation. Grummles make very good living selling Kafa'kota Blend, but it's dangerous now thanks to our cousin. He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming. Kafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves. Uncle Keenbean will pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota. Here, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa. 
Speak with Ban Bearheart outside the Shado-Pan Monastery in Kun-Lai Summit.	Where are My Reinforcements?	This has simply gone too far. I cannot ignore our abandonment any longer. After all that's happened here, and all you've been through in Firebough, we must travel to the monastery. Whatever they are doing in there can wait! We can take my balloon up the mountain to the Monastery. It's anchored back by the camp, to the northeast. 
Slay 8 Snagtooth Spotters, Tool-Grabbers, or Troublemakers. Then slay 18 Snagtooth Pesterlings.	A Seemingly Endless Nuisance	I apologize for the state of things around here. The virmen - those rabbity creatures, down the hill - have been pushing further and further into my family's farm, and our crops - which are normally bigger, and more delicious, by the way - have been suffering because of it. I'm no soldier... but you might be! Would you mind pushing some of these virmen off of our land? 
Free 6 Domination Mages by killing Korune Wardens.	Bloodlines	We managed to fend off the mogu wardens and their dogs, but many of the blood elves from the scouting party were not as lucky. Many of my people are trapped inside the ruins to the north. We are devising a solution to break them out, but I believe there may be a more straightforward approach. Go to the ruins and kill the wardens guarding each prisoner. If my intuition is correct, this will free our comrades. 
Steal the Choker of Storms from The Swollen Vault.	Raiding the Vault	The Swollen Vault is a repository for some of Lei Shen's nastiest weaponry and most prized trinkets - not surprisingly, these are often one and the same. One artifact in particular, an amulet known as the Choker of Storms, could help us to understand his apparent mastery over lightning. Break into the vault and slay the hoard-keeper. Take his key and use it to recover the amulet from a cache at the back of the vault. 
Find the cave entrance and recover Old Man Thistle's hidden treasure.	Old Man Thistle's Treasure	Well high golly! This is turning into a real life treasure hunt! There's gotta be some kind of entrance or opening to the north, where the mountains meet Cattail Lake. I'll meet ya at the entrance! Let's go get that treasure! 
Free 6 Sunreaver Dragonhawks.	Krasus' Landing	We can rescue as many Sunreavers as we want, but if they can't escape, then there's no point. The Silver Covenant will certainly be subduing and killing the Sunreavers' dragonhawks. Put a stop to it. 
Speak with Kairoz on the Timeless Isle.	Time Keeper Kairoz	You have found your way to the Timeless Isle, Mechanic. The bronze dragonflight is keen to investigate the mysteries of this place, but the island is dangerous, and we will need your help. Midway up this beach, you will find a paved path to the east. It will lead you to the ancient Celestial Court. You will find Kairoz there, one of the Keepers of Time that we are working with. Kairoz will answer any questions you might have. Be careful: The way may not be safe. 
Attach the climbing rope to each Rope Anchor along the path to help Seer Hao Pham Roo reach Seeker's Point.	Path of the Last Emperor	In his time of uncertainty, the last emperor walked a lonely path up this mountain, until he had at last found his answers. I am here to walk the same path, and it seems you have questions of your own to be answered. Perhaps you will join me, and we can both be satisfied? Oh, but I am getting old, and this blizzard is proving too much for my bones. Could you climb ahead and anchor this rope? I can hoist myself along from there. Together we shall walk the path of the last emperor. 
	Seeds of Fear	 
Investigate the Mercurial Guardian and obtain the Ancient Korune Tablet.	Voice of the Gods	Too slowly!? We are working as quickly as possible for the Warchief! We must excavate carefully, catalogue each find, and of course follow safety procedures. He must understand! Well, we may have something to show him soon. Do you see that stone statue to the west? We suspect it is an ancient stone storage vessel. Now we just have to find a way to open it. If you would care to help us with our excavation, please go about it carefully. 
Obtain 6 Emerald Tailfeathers, 6 Crimson Tailfeathers, and 6 Dusky Tailfeathers.	Particular Plumage	When the crocs started attacking, they scared a bunch of the lories out of their nests, up in that island to our northwest. I can use those lories' feathers to make some specialized lures, which will come in handy if and when I get to stop defending my brethren from these reptiles. You up for some feather hunting? 
Obtain an Enormous Cattail Grouper Tooth.	A Gift For Haohan	Haohan Mudclaw is the big boss of the Tillers union and the richest guy in the Valley! He's been nice to let me stay here, so I want to do something nice for him. He likes expensive stuff, like ruby shards, but I don't have a lot of money, so I need to get him something else. I know! I've seen a great big fish in Cattail Lake! We should get one of its teeth as a gift! 
Use the Shado-Pan Torch on 20 Palewind Villagers.	Dust to Dust	If we are to make camp here, we cannot leave all of these yaungol bodies lying to rot. Take this torch and set fire to the villagers' corpses. The incense from the torch should purify the earth and air around them as well. Even our enemies deserve to be laid to rest. 
Speak with Waterspeaker Gorai, and then complete the Ritual.	The Ritual	From the moment I first rose from the river, I knew I was destined to be Waterspeaker. I was taught many rituals, and have performed all of them, save one. There was one, an extremely ancient one, that we were told to call upon if our people ever turned against us. This must have happened in our people's distant past, because we haven't needed to use it in our village's memory. I suppose now is the time to do so. 
Obtain a Goldenfire Orchid.	A Gift For Gina	Have you seen Gina Mudclaw, the market girl? She has it all - looks, brains, and nice big tummy. Could you deliver a gift for me? I wanted to pick some orchids that grow on top of the big hills to the west, but I can't climb that high. Could you pick a few and bring them to Gina? Oh, and when you see her... tell her I said ""hi"". 
Complete the ""Dark Heart of Pandaria"" scenario. You can queue from the Dungeon Finder or use Lorewalker Cho's Dream Brew.	The Warchief and the Darkness	I see now how the Alliance king leads his people. But what is the Horde warchief up to? Just below us, a swarm of goblins are burrowing into the sacred vale on his orders. What does he hope to find there? We must find out! 
Use Ban's Explosives to destroy 6 Osul Ballistas.	Pitching In	The yaungol's siege weapons - those ballista spearthrowers down there - are tearing apart our defenses both at Longying Oupost and in Kun-Lai Summit. Those terrible weapons must be destroyed. Take these explosives. I've covered them in the pitch that you collected. Toss them at those ballistas, and we'll give the yaungol a little taste of their own medicine. 
Launch the Mist-Hopper Jr. from the dock in Soggy's Gamble and use it to bring down Jiao.	The Mariner's Revenge	I'm not gonna sit in a damn rocking chair while my crew gets devoured by a leviathan! Come on, let's get to the dock and launch a dinghy. I got a special one set up just for this kind of situation. My own little Mist-Hopper Jr. We'll give that thing a case of harpoon fever. 
Solve 1 artifact from Pandaria.	Uncovering the Past	Interested in being a Lorewalker? There is lots of digging and reading and digging and more reading. I have entire days where I stare at a broken vase trying to figure out how it goes back together. Should give it a try. Go solve one artifact of Pandaria and we will appreciate you sharing the knowledge of how you did it. 
Kill 16 Gai-Cho Yaungol, Earthtalkers or Pitchthrowers.	Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho	The Yaungol are a constant nuisance, but the group at Fire Camp Gai-Cho, to the northeast, conspired with the Osul yaungol in their recent incursion into Kun-Lai. We cannot allow such an incursion to go unpunished. Go, attack Fire Camp Gai-Cho. We need to make sure they remain occupied, so that they cannot rise up and threaten The Ox Gate again. 
Obtain 8 of Yoon's Apples and 50 of Yoon's Craneberries, then bring them to Bobo Ironpaw to brew into Apple-Berry Hooch.	A Gift For Jogu	Sometimes I feel sad for Jogu. He's the only jinyu around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course. You know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the Halfhill Market and get him to brew something special for Jogu. 
Use Sully's Flaregun to destroy 5 Horde War Wagons.	Welcome Wagons	Did you see the size of those war wagons? They're packing so many explosives, I cannae tell if the Horde is here to take over this continent or just blow it out of the sea! We need to neutralize those wagons before they leave Garrosh'ar Point. Here, take me pocket flares. Fire 'em into a wagon and watch the fireworks! 
	Baruk Obliterator	 
Find and disable the 3 Oubliette Shackles.	The Arcanic Oubliette	An Alliance member? Here? Elune be praised. My team has encountered a snag. We opened a portal to this land using some ancient scrolls we had found that predated Azshara's rule. Unfortunately, the coordinates provided on the tablets were warded and the portal that meant to take us to our destination landed us in this oubliette. We have been trapped here for days, and it is slowly leaching our energies to power itself. Can you find the nearby shackles that bind the oubliette and disable them? 
Kill the Ordo Warbringer.	The Ordo Warbringer	<The shield is down. Time to head into the cave and slay the Warbringer of the Ordo!> 
Lay Shado-Master Zhiyao, Liu of the Thousand Blows and Shiya Boldblade to rest.	A Line Unbroken	When we regrouped after their initial attack, we numbered three less. You can fight, and we must plan our defense should these cursed yaungol attack again. If you would help us, grant our fallen comrades their last rites, and recover their armor. You will find their bodies to the west, near the gate. And try to keep the birds off them. 
Point out Pools of Corruption in Inkgill Mere to Waterspeaker Gorai to let him know you are ready to defend him while he completes the cleansing ritual.	Cleansing the Mere	Pools of the same murky substance that came out of Mei emerged in the lake recently. I will travel into the Mere with you. Point out the pools of corruption that you are ready for me to cleanse. You will need to deal with whatever comes out and protect me as I complete the ritual. 
Ride Chen's Kite to scout the Mogu armies.	Kite Surveillance	We heard for ourselves that there were mogu attacking, but I had no idea it would be this many! There must be a way to stop them before they completely overrun the Vale. Quickly, let us fly over and scout out their numbers. We just so happen to have a kite that can carry three people. Usually it's more, but I had a big lunch. 
Speak to Bowmistress Li at the Gate of the Setting Sun between the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and the Dread Wastes.	The Klaxxi	The Klaxxi are only rumored to exist, far beyond the wall in the Dread Wastes. Few have ventured into that territory, and none have returned to tell the tale. If you are set on finding these... Klaxxi... there is a small group of Shado-Pan manning the wall to the far southwest who may know more. 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	The Threat in the South	With the Sha of Hatred dead, the greatest threat to this land is vanquished, but our travels along the southern border have made it exceedingly clear that the mantid forces in the Dread Wastes are on the move, and likely won't be held back for long. If you wish to continue to aid the Shado-Pan, I would recommend reporting in to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine. She oversees the great wall that separates the terrors in the Dread Wastes from our bountiful lands to the east. 
Plant Shado-Pan Gas Bombs within the 5 targeted structures on Sra'vess.	Fumigation	Our alchemists have cooked up a set of gas bombs that will discourage mantid from staying anywhere that we set them off. If we plant these in the critical structures of Sra'vess, they'll need to evacuate. That should sow some chaos and delay any action from the mantid there for days. Get to it, George. 
Guide Mudmug to Swirling Pools within the Gilded Fan, and help him collect 30 pawfuls of Gladewater. If you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the Gilded Fan.	The Great Water Hunt	Look at it, George: the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too. No sayin' what kind of water Chen's gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter? Come on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together. 
Drink from Cho's Teapot.	Stay a While, and Listen	Rush rush rush - are your people always in such a hurry? Sit and have some tea with me a moment, and we will discuss your plight.<Lorewalker Cho's features settle into a patient smile.> 
Slay Captain Doren.	The Darkness Within	You didn't see Captain Doren while you were out there, did you? That sniveling Alliance leader must be in hiding somewhere. If he wasn't in that airbase, he can't be far. Search the perimeter - try searching the cave southwest of the main airfield. I want the Alliance gone from here! 
Kill 4 Onyx Warserpents in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Subjugated Serpents	Where the Zan-Tien march, the warserpents are sure to follow. I cannot stress to you enough how dangerous these beasts are. It is a shame to see them subjugated by the mogu, but we cannot afford to let them run rampant. I need you to put them down before they can wreak havoc on our lines. 
Speak to Elder Sage Tai-Feng at the Jade Temple Grounds in The Jade Forest.	Attack At The Temple of the Jade Serpent	Darkness enshrouds the Temple of the Jade Serpent, and Yu'Lon's priests beseech us for aid. They hold the sha in check, but just barely. You may be able to turn the tide, Mechanic. 
Kill Uruk at Deadtalker's Plateau in Townlong Steppes.	Uruk!	Uruk is the Deadtalker of the Townlong yaungol. Your mission will not be truly complete until you defeat him. Go to it! 
Bring the Washed Yaks to Lucky Eightcoins at the Grummle Bazaar in Kun-Lai Summit. Return to Muskpaw Jr. if you lose your yaks.	Back in Yak	I wasn't lying about your reward. Here, take these washed yaks to the grummle caravan master Eightcoins. You can find him at the Grummle Bazaar west of here. He'll credit us and give you a delivery fee. He may be short, but he is our biggest customer. Return to me if you lose the yaks. More often than not they just come right back here anyway. Once they've been cleaned that is. 
Slay the Springtail Warren-Mother.	The Lesser of Two Evils	Like any farming community, we have the occasional virmen troubles. The most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the cliffs to the north, and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on. Frankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that. 
Kill the Coldbite Matriarch.	The Root of the Problem	Kypari Zar is dying. A creature of terrible darkness corrupts it from deep beneath its roots. The tree cannot be saved, but at least we can lessen its pain. Look. The vile creature has carved a path to its own lair. We need only follow it down the hill, just behind this tower. 
	Many More Giant Dinosaur Bones	 
Slay 10 Ale-Addled Hozen or Mischievous Virmen.	Clear the Way	Are you seeing this? Virmen, hozen, and water sprites... all pouring out of the brewery doors and windows! What the heck is going on in there!?There is another entrance, on the eastern side of the brewery. I'm going to run over there and try to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, see if you can't get rid of these creatures. There's nothing worse than a drunken hozen. 
Find Wu-Peng in the Inkgill Mere.	My Son...	My son - can you find my son? When the Jinyu attacked, he ran off in the confusion. I don't know if they've done anything with him, or if he's still alive, even. Nothing else matters if I can't find him. I'd ask Mei... but something's wrong with her. She seems too... impulsive since the attack. I just can't trust that she'd bring him back safely. 
Inspire 3 Hiding Guides in Howlingwind Cavern to help you.	Instant Courage	It is very bad fortune to travel mountain paths without a good guide. We grummles make the best guides, but many have run away. They fear the mountain pass now. Many good grummles disappear up there. Grummles are good at many things, but are not very brave. Maybe with fire lotus incense you can make them brave. Then they will show you the way. 
Gather 8 Freshly Fallen Petals.	The Perfect Color	As you have seen, this grove is abundant with beautiful pink petals. As each petal ages, the tone deepens and fades. If you would be so kind, I am in need of a few petals that have freshly fallen. Only the ones that have just fallen will have precisely the right color I am after. From it I can forge an ink that will be breathtaking. Can you help me? 
Meet Connelly in Kun-Lai Summit. Speak to Fennie Hornswaggle at Lion's Landing for transportation.	He's In Deep	Agent Connelly has managed to infiltrate Garrosh's camp in Kun-Lai! He's been following their every move. Connelly requested you specifically to assist him in gathering some vital intelligence. He sent along a disguise for you. Make sure you put it on before approaching the camp! It will no doubt be heavily guarded. He insists you will know him when you see him. Something about your keen eye for details...Go talk to Fennie over there for a drop-off. 
Speak to Shado-Master Chong at Shado-Pan Fallback in Firebough Nook.	The Shado-Pan	Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of Pandaren they call the ""Shado-Pan"". They are apparently very strong, and secretive. That's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook. You should travel there as an envoy of the Alliance. Give them any help they require. 
Kill 9 Seething Fleshrippers.	Enraged By Hatred	These scorpions are infected with sha. It seems to have driven them out of their hole and into our camp, seething with hatred at invaders in their territory. We need to clear the scorpions and secure the camp. Kill any you find. 
Obtain a Kunzen Legend-Book from a Kunzen Legend-Chief.	The Kunzen Legend-Chief	I've heard people talk about the hozen like they're just some tribe of barely-functional idiots... but that's not true! They have brains, too - they just don't all like to use them that much. I've heard that the Kunzen tribe has two chiefs - one in charge of fighting, and one in charge of stories, lore, and history. What I wouldn't give to see what kind of stories they tell... 
Listen to Amber Kearnen's report.	SI:7 Report: Take No Prisoners	The final leg of our journey took us west, to a large hozen village. We set up a small camp in the mountains, outside of their line of sight... 
Obtain the Slingtail Key by slaying Kung Din.	Kung Din	I hope you are capable of this next task, for our lives depend on it. There is only one key that will unlock our chains. Unfortunately, the key hangs around the neck of the hozen's pet tiger, Kung Din. They keep the tiger in the great pit to the north. The only way to retrieve the key will be to kill the beast. 
	A Dish for Farmer Fung	 
Slay 7 Shuffling Mistlurkers and 2 Kyparites.	The Horror Comes A-Rising	We are protected from the mantid. Such was the agreement made so many millennia ago. There are forces from which we are not safe, however. The kyparites beneath the ground to the west will haunt us, chase us... even eat us. The mistlurkers eat our kind by the handful. Help our people, outsider. Defeat our enemies. 
Ride Mobi with Chen and Li Li to the Gate of August Celestials.	Our Backs to the Gate	It is most fortuitous that you found this brew, and a yak to carry it on! But we cannot remain here. Li Li has healed me up enough to travel. We can ride the yak back to the gate and hope that the mogu do not notice our passing. Let me know when you are ready to leave. 
Help Dog to eat the remains of 10 Rockshell Snapclaws.	Dog Food	<Dog whines as best as a lion seal can, feebly lifting one flipper toward his massive jaws. He's hungry. The Shelf of Mazu is covered in rockshell makrura that should make a fine meal for him.> 
Use the Sunreaver Portal in Domination Point to secure a teleport to Darnassus.	Insertion	George! You'll do perfectly. We know where the Alliance have hidden the Divine Bell. We've already inserted an agent into enemy territory, we just need you to help him execute his mission. Pack up, George. You're headed to Darnassus. 
Speak with the Zandalari Prisoner.	Revelations	The prisoner is being kept upstairs, George. It will be difficult to get information from him, but even the slightest detail about their location will help. The elders have begun questioning him already. With their help we should be able to figure out our next move. Go speak with him and see if he has any useful information. 
Slay 6 Shek'zeer Clutch-Keepers in the Clutches of Shek'zeer.	The Dread Clutches	The imperial clutches have become an abomination! Clutch-Keepers rush the development of new swarmborn, saturating them in this vile ""sha"" energy before sending them away to the wall. The Klaxxi wish to stem the tide of swarmborn production in these dread clutches. Put the keepers to death! 
Bring 3 Motherseeds to the collection pit in Rikkitun Village, with the assistance of the Rikkitun Chanters. You can use the Rikkitun Bell to re-summon your chanters if you become separated.	Great Vessel of Salvation	I know what you and the girl-panda seek. We can perform the rite for you... in time. First, I require aid. The seeds fall from our great mother-tree. It is our responsibility to collect them, even in dangerous times like these. Escort my chanters to the motherseeds, that they may bring them back to the collection pit. 
Meet up with Suna Silentstrike at Longying Outpost in the Townlong Steppes.	My Husband...	Lin...I don't care what Ban, Lao-Chin, or even Taran Zhu says. I'm moving ahead into Townlong. I may not be able to save Lin myself, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to catch up. Once Taran Zhu opens the doors to his precious monastery, we'll save Lin. Until then, I'll scout ahead and make sure he's alright. 
Kill an Alliance Hero at Lion's Landing in Krasarang Wilds.	Hero Killer	There are some situations in which taking out one of their soldiers is more important than killing hundreds. They've deployed some of their heroes to the battlefield to help rally their defenders. Not only will killing them soften their defense, it will also leave their morale crippled. So go, take one down for me. You can handle it. 
Rescue Brother Rabbitsfoot from the Broketooth Outpost.	The Rabbitsfoot	The Broketooth hozen stole our Rabbitsfoot! He was the grummle with the biggest luckydo. This is very bad fortune indeed. Please, Human, we need our Rabbitsfoot back. We need his good fortune back. Can you search the Broketooth Outpost for him? 
Confront 6 Sha-Touched Footmen. Should you lose Prince Anduin, speak to him at The Imperial Exchange.	Heart Of The Alliance	I can't believe this has happened, George. After all we have been through here on Pandaria, will our people never learn from their past mistakes? Brann's expedition returned recently from Mogujia, bearing a sample of sha for study. I had my reservations about this endeavor in the first place, and my worst fears have been realized. The sha has escaped containment. I do not need to explain the horror of bringing the sha into the heart of the Vale. We must dispel any sha we can find, and quickly! 
Using the Recovered Gyrocopter, kill 25 Hozen Gutrippers and 25 Hozen Nibstabbers.	Acid Rain	Since you've been gone, more and more of these creatures are approaching our camp. They appear to be amassing for a major assault! We're going to have to take some drastic measures if we hope to see tomorrow. Here, take my poisoned throwing stars and figure out a way to thin out their numbers. 
Fish 10 Sugar Minnow from any fresh or salt water in Pandaria.	Snack Time	Cloud serpents love to eat, and one of their favorite treats is the sugar minnow. These fish can be found in salt or fresh water anywhere in Pandaria. I trust you have some skill in fishing, and your own fishing pole to catch them? Bring me a fresh catch and I'm sure the hungry beasts around here will be very grateful. 
Allow Chief Rikkitun to enchant the Forked Blade.	Bind the Glamour	It has been a very, very long time since our tribe has been called on to perform this rite. I will do the best I can. 
Mount Mobi and defeat the mogu armies with the power of brew.	Liquid Courage	We have to do something about all these mogu. At least to thin their ranks before they invade the Vale! As much as Uncle Chen loves his brew, I think we can put it to better use. Let's hop onto that yak and give the mogu something to fear! 
Use the Vision of Time in the Siege of Orgrimmar.	Refining The Vision	I have finished grinding the stones, and have attuned the hourglass to a new series of timeways. Will you return to the Siege of Orgrimmar and turn the hourglass once more? Return quickly, I am most curious. 
Use the Vision of Time in the Caverns of Time in Tanaris.	One Final Turn	I do not wish to ask this of you again, but I do not know who I can trust any longer. I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time. It is in the Caverns of Time itself. I did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass. The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time. Move quickly! 
Shoot down 50 Kor'thik Swarmers and Voress'thalik.	Hostile Skies	We're about to get hit hard... Pick up that cannon there and lend a hand, if you would. There will be no shortage of targets. 
Obtain Spicemaster Jin Jao's Payment, Trader Jambeezi's Payment, Innkeeper Lei Lan's Payment, and Lolo Lio's payment.	Money Matters	I love working in the market, although there's one aspect of this job I really dislike: collecting debts. While most pandaren debts are simply due to laziness, there are a few unsavory characters around town who simply don't want to pay, and there's some who are just too poor. A few people here in town owe me money. Could you go talk to them, and remind them about what they owe? 
Gather 6 Murkscale Heads from Murkscale Strikers in Krasarang River.	The Murksweats	Take a good look. The river nearby is swarming with these snakes. Their venom causes a condition the locals call ""the murksweats.""Several refugees were bitten as they fled the temple and have already begun to show symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and intense sweating as the body rejects all fluids, causing dehydration and potentially death. We are administering anti-venom as quickly as possible, but we'll need more venom glands. Don't bother removing the glands yourself - just bring back the whole head. 
Obtain a Bloody Plainshawk Leg from a Monstrous Plainshawk, and then bring it to Kol Ironpaw in the Halfhill Market.	A Gift For Fung	Farmer Fung is pretty mean, and just a little scary. Mah always said that he was one of the best farmers in the valley, though. I think I know the perfect gift for a mean, kind of scary guy like him. There's some big plainshawks that circle the hills to the west of here. You should get one, find a big piece of meat, and then ask Kol Ironpaw to grill it up! 
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane at the Angkhal Pavilion.	Ellia Ravenmane	We regularly organize one-on-one duels with trainees that we think are well-suited for one another. We have found one such trainee for you, George. Her name is Ellia Ravenmane. This will be her first duel, too. She will be waiting for you at the pavilion just to the south of here. 
Bring the Ashes of Warlord Gurthan to Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver at Klaxxi'vess.	The Warlord's Ashes	<Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver defeated Warlord Gurthan centuries ago, but the mogu beastmaster's spirit continues to haunt the ruins of his old stronghold. Showing proof of your victory over this spirit may gain you favor in the eyes of the Klaxxi.> 
Kill Konk.	Seein' Red	I was just about ta curl up an' die, mon. Now, dis! Snuff an' me go way back. Oh, da memories...No way I can face Snuff in da afterlife without avengin' his death first, mon! Dese hooligans be led by one named Konk. We gotta sniff him out an' den snuff him out - for Snuff! 
Defeat the Challenger at the Tiger Temple.	The Third Riddle: Strength	The mallet you seek is not a toy for children,It calls trouble like the song of a siren. A test of strength the Monkey King will require,Before you receive this tool of your desire. At the Temple of the White Tiger you will findA challenger to test how well you are resignedStep through the main door and then turn right down the rampChallenge the ook waiting for you there like a champ! 
Defeat a Champion of Chi-Ji.	Champion of Chi-Ji	While you will always hold a place of honor among our order, you are still welcome to participate in our duels. One of our current champions awaits you in the Dome Balrissa. I know that they would be honored to duel with you. 
Leash and return 6 Windward Hatchlings to their nests.	Empty Nests	When the attacks began, the young hatchlings scattered in terror. They are roaming around the island, lost and scared. If you want to help, take this rope and leash the lost little ones. Take them back to their nests. Return them home. 
Kill 4 Amani Skirmishers, 4 Gurubashi Hexxers, and 3 Drakkari Frostweavers in Zouchin Province.	Make A Fighter Out of Me	Shhh! Don't speak so loudly! My father might hear you.<Shomi gestures to Steelbender Doshu.>My father is delusional! He thinks I should be studying my tea pouring while our village is under attack. It's ridiculous! I have just as much courage as any man. I just don't know how to fight... yet. That's where you come in. Let me travel with you! I'm a fast learner and I won't get in the way I promise! Pleaseeeeee! If we get separated I'll meet you back in the village. 
Slay Arcanist Rathaella.	The Silver Covenant's Stronghold	I have it on good authority that Archmage Aethas Sunreaver is being held in the Silver Enclave, home of the Silver Covenant. Arcanist Rathaella holds him in captivity. Most Covenant agents are out slaughtering Sunreavers right now, which means our chance is ripe. Slay Rathaella, and spring Aethas from his prison. 
	FLAG - Ancient Pandaren Mining Pick	 
Kill 4 Cagemasters.	Unleash The Yeti!	Your yeti ride gave me an idea. The Ook of Dook has a pet yeti he named Chomp Chomp. He uses this yeti to scare other hozen in to making him the leader hozen. We need to get rid of that yeti. Go to Dooker Dome northwest of here and defeat some of the Cagemasters so Chomp Chomp is not tied up as much. Yakshoe and I will meet you there with lots of incense and a dirty yak. 
Visit the Shrine of the Sun, the Shrine of the Moon, and Kill Dook Ookem.	Lay of the Land	Curse these furry pests! Kill one, and two more rise in its place...Nothing has changed, George. Orders are orders, no matter how few of us stand and regardless of the odds. I have plans to make and problems to solve. I want you to get out there and learn the lay of the land. Don't return until you have something useful to report. And silence that yammering fool while you're out there! Dismissed! 
Defeat 8 Silkwood Stalkers.	The Silkwood Road	West of here is the Silkwood Road. It has fallen into shadow as the spiders there have turned to a more evil and gluttonous path. I would face these villains myself but someone has to defend the noodle shop from... um... dangers and such. Go, hero, and conquer these beasts! Should you succeed perhaps I shall regale you with some of my epic tales of heroism. I'll also pay you. 
Speak to Instructor Windblade at The Arboretum.	They Grow Like Weeds	Ahh, it is you again, George. Instructor Windblade is looking for you. You can find her on the ridge to the east. She has some news about your cloud serpent. 
Brave the path of Seeker's Folly to find Lorewalker Cho, stopping to reflect at the three shrines along the way.	Seeker's Folly	I'm sure your pandaren friend has some ideas about what the mogu are after. He headed up the mountain a few days ago without a guide, and asked that only you be sent up after him. He was very specific:""The Mechanic must endure the trek alone, with only <his/her> thoughts. <He/She> will honor each shrine before meeting me at the top.""The path is just northwest of the camp, marked by flags. Please be careful! Seeker's Folly is a dangerous trek even on a lucky day. 
Bring the Bundle of Kafa'kota Berries to the Lair of Kota Kon, near the top of Kota Peak.	A Fair Trade	<The roar bellows out again, louder and more fierce than any of the yetis you've encountered so far. Again, a grummle voice replies...>Eep! Please, great Kota Kon, forgive grummle. Let me go, I'll bring lots of kafa right away! Promise!<The beast called Kota Kon answers with another meaty roar.> 
Obtain 25 Unbruised Yak Haunches.	Beastmaster's Hunt: The Tiger	Along with the trap, you get some advice on tiger hunting:Tigers are gluttonous creatures, and large game is hard to come by in this jungle. If you wish to tempt the most elder cats out of their hiding places, you may do so with a meal. Just on the other side of the Serpent's Spine, you will find a herd of yaks. Slay them, bring their meat to the jungle's edge, set up your trap, and wait. 
Perform 12 practice strikes in the Monastery Training Arena by following the leader's example.	Perfection	Perfection can be achieved through repetition. Every single student in the training arena below will eventually perfect his or her form... assuming they don't give up first. This is a fact. I encourage you to join them, George. As an honorary guest of the monastery, you are not required to perform the requisite 10,000 daily strikes. Simply follow the leader's example for a few minutes. 
Obtain a Boiling Cauldron from Mother Wu in the Waxwood Forest, then return to Groundskeeper Wu in the Tian Monastery.	A Strong Back	Some of our trainees have... larger-than normal appetites. We have occasionally had difficulty supplying enough food for all of them. In times like these, we have to ask for help. A kindly older woman, who lives in a small house to the northwest, has agreed to make some stew for our trainees. All you need to do is go and get it. 
Fill the Empty Oil Vial at a Yaungol Oil Derrick.	Oil Stop	When the yaungols came, they began to dig up oil. What is this ""oil"", I wonder? Perhaps it is thing of much undiscovered luck. This I must know. Here, take this vial, and fill it with yaungol oil from one of their windmills. I will give you many fortunes if you bring me some. 
Listen to Shokia's report.	Scouting Report: Like Jinyu in a Barrel	With our leader turned to jade, our hozen guide disappeared, and a prisoner of war in tow, there was only one thing that Kiryn and I could do:March into our enemy's territory and deliver some vengeance. Want to know how it went? 
Meditate with Lorewalker Cho at the pagoda at the Dreamer's Pavilion in the Jade Forest.	Finding Your Center	The dream brew is complete! This time, when you drink it, you must embrace the visions you see from a state of inner focus. Follow me to my pagoda, and I will teach you how to achieve the inner calm that we pandaren value so much. Your troubled mind will present you with many distractions, but just remember to stay centered! 
Give Vaeldrin's message to Lyalia.	The Waters of Youth	She is headstrong, my little Lyalia. I should have known she would try to challenge the Lord Reclaimer. Since her mother died, I forsook much of the time I should have spent with her in search of immortality, insisting that we could live forever, together. And now my obsession has cost my little Lyalia her life. Please, $p, when she wakes, tell her I love her. 
Defeat Prophet Kharzul.	Prophet Khar'zul	Prophet Khar'zul is a powerful caster, but he is also underestimating your abilities. Khar'zul and his forces must be destroyed to protect this village. His death will send a strong message to the Thunder King that we will not be defeated! You'll find him on the Isle of Reckoning. 
Deliver return orders to Scout Wei-Chin, Scout Long, Scout Ying, and Scout Jai-Gan.	The Restless Watch	I'm being told that our scouts have been on duty in Shallowstep Pass for more than 2 days straight, no rest. No wonder mantid are slipping through. Even the most dedicated scouts would slip with those kinds of shifts. I want you to go out there and deliver orders to the scouts that they are to return to the battlefront immediately for rest and rations. I'll arrange for a new shift to be posted. 
Burn 6 Banners of the Black Empire in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Mark of the Conquerors	The invading minions of N'Zoth lay claim to lands they are not entitled to. The Vale will not be conquered while even one of the Rajani still draws breath. Burn down their banners as a reminder of this. 
Collect 8 Amberfly Wings.	Hue	The most distinguishing feature of the Dream Brew is its iridescent, dream-like color. To the east, you will find Glittering Amberflies. I will need their wings to create the final luminescent color of the brew. Take this knife and use it to collect 8 wings. 
Speak with Jaina Proudmoore and hear her story.	The Fate of Dalaran	Jaina is refusing to hear me out. Father was hoping I would have some pull with her, but I think she still sees me as a child. You, on the other hand, are a hero of the Alliance and I know she respects your deeds. Is there something you can say to her to convince her we need her help? 
Find Baine Bloodhoof at Garrosh'ar Advance. Speak to Tak-Tak at Domination Point for transportation.	The Kun-Lai Expedition	I have another message for you from High Chieftain Bloodhoof. It seems you've made quite the impression on him. He travels with the Warchief's vanguard into Kun-Lai Summit, to the north. They have set up an outpost, Garrosh'ar Advance, just east of One Keg. You had best not keep him waiting. Speak to Tak-Tak for swift travel. 
Collect 9 Palewind Totems.	Totemic Research	As we entered the village, I couldn't help but notice yaungol totems lying around this camp. I have a suspicion that there are dark forces at work here, and those totems may be the key to drawing them out. Could you bring me some of these totems for further inspection? I would like to study them. 
Kill 12 Dreadlings within the Niuzao Catacombs.	A Trail of Fear	You now know Niuzao's secret. We are not only the wardens of this temple... we were the wardens of the Sha of Fear that was buried beneath it. The Sha itself may have escaped... but it left traces behind. If you're truly going down into the catacombs, you should eliminate those traces, before they escape and cause greater problems than those we already face. 
Gather 7 Amber-Filled Jars from the Amber Collectors on the Stinging Trail.	Better With Age	It is a crime to harvest the young trees, but a much bigger crime to waste the amber. Young amber is not as strong, but the Klaxxi need it to continue the fight. We will bring them more and they will sing my praises! Gather the young amber. We will store it until it is aged and can be consumed. 
	Goldbough Guardian	 
Search Sik'thik Cages for Restless Leng.	The Search for Restless Leng	One of my best scouts, Restless Leng, went missing during a mission on the other side of Sik'vess. I'm hopeful that he was captured rather than killed, but with the mantid corrupted so heavily by sha, it doesn't seem likely. Still, can you investigate the cages around Sik'vess? I owe him a more thorough search than even this, but I have no men to spare without allowing our southern lines to break. Please, Mechanic, even if there's no life left in him, find him that I might know his fate. 
Kill 8 members of the Kunzen tribe in the Kunzen Village.	Not in Chee-Chee's Backyard	Not all hozen are the same. Chee-Chee's tribe was forest hozen... came from Jade Forest. Pretty easy to get along with. The Kunzen invaders... they come from mountains, far to the north. Not nearly as nice as Chee-Chee. They come into our green land, take our things, leave big mess behind. Chee-Chee wants to kill them. You like to help? 
Destroy 5 Tormented Spirits.	An End to Everything	These spirits must have been released when the tombs were opened... Death was not final for the Mogu. Instead, death was merely a stop over on the path to a new body. Spiritbinders used a foul magic to transfer spirits from one shell to the next. Years of being trapped in the tombs has left them confused. They need to be destroyed before their confusion turns to anger or worse, they find a new shell. 
Retrieve 6 Stolen Weapons from the Zandalari Invaders.	What's Yours Is Mine	The elders want us to mount a defense? We're not monks, Mechanic; we need weapons if we hope to fight! Scavenge some arms from those barbarians for me. I should be able to melt them down and make something more suitable for our villagers to fight with. Bring me as many as you can carry and I'll take care of the rest. 
	Tracking Quest - Spectral Pirate Treasure	 
Find a hidden treasure on the Timeless Isle.	Timeless Treasures	The journal indicates that treasures abound across the island, sometimes temptingly out of reach, and other times hidden in dark caves and hollows. What might have been secreted away here, many generations ago? And perhaps more importantly, by whom? Search the island for such treasures, and return to me with your findings. Be warned that all that glitters is not gold, yet the reverse is also true. Sometimes the simple hollowed-out stump is the best hiding place for one's valuables. 
Use the Shado-Pan Dragon Gun to destroy 20 Dreadspinner Eggs in Gurthani Terrace.	Nope Nope Nope	I recovered this weapon on a recent scouting run near the wall. It would seem ideal for helping your Shado-Pan with their infestation problem in Gurthani Terrace. The more they are focused on keeping spiders off the wall, the less time they are killing fear-gripped swarmborn. 
Destroy 10 Stacks of Thunder Hold Munitions.	Fire Is Always the Answer	It's not enough that we destroy their forces. Nothing must be left for them to salvage! Take this flare-gun and fire it into their munitions stockpiles. Leave them nothing! 
Defeat 20 Shado-Pan Trainees in the Battle Ring.	The Battle Ring	We have some fresh trainees that are far from being a danger to you, but in numbers, they may prove enough of a challenge. And if not, they could use the lesson in humility. Step into the battle ring when you're ready. Don't go easy on them. 
Kill any 15 non-elite mantid near Sra'vess.	Sra'vess Wetwork	The mantid outnumber us quite badly. Hundreds of them for each of us. And, they surround us on two sides - at Gao-Ran in the south we're holding them off, but to the west, on the island they call Sra'vess, they continue to mass unabated. We're not stupid. We're not going to launch a full scale attack on them. We can't sustain an intense battle on multiple fronts. Instead, we're going to send you, and one of our Wu Kao, to do some dirty work. Sounds fun, doesn't it? 
Destroy 6 Mogu Statues in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Built to Fall	The Baruk use the forbidden arts of necromancy to trap souls of fallen mogu into the statues that fight for them. These tactics are a disgrace to our people, and cannot be allowed to continue. Break their precious statues, and give them no vessels with which to contaminate with their stolen spirits. 
Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore, then break into the lower city and secure it for the Alliance.	Tear Down This Wall!	The time has come. Our forces are well-enough entrenched here that we can risk pressing forward, into the Thunder King's lair. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like he'll be opening that gate anytime soon. I suppose we'll have to make a gate of our own then. Let me know when you're ready, George. 
Obtain Darkhide's Head.	Mushan Mastery: Darkhide	My boy here is a talented hunter... in training. Let's show him an old 'Nessy style hunt shall we? I saw a mighty big mushan east of here with a hide dark as night. It looked like it had taken down a number of hunters in its day. If you want a big game hunt, go try an' take it on. 
Pick up Hillpaw's Chickens until you find his Prize-Winning Chicken.	Chasing the Chicken	Say, you there! George, was it? I've got a problem, and I need someone with better legs than mine to help me solve it. My prize-winning chicken has flown the coop! Now she's out in the open, mingling with the other hens, wild birds, and... <gulp> ill-intentioned roosters. My farm is west of here, south of the Skyrange. Could you find her, and bring her back to me? 
Board the jade cart and ride with Hao back to Emperor's Omen.	What's Mined Is Yours	Aw'right, so you need jade, do ya? I'd say we owe you at least that - we got plenty in the quarry, and thanks to yer help we should be back on schedule in no time. I should probably get back to the wife, so let's you and me take this cart o' the good stuff straight to her. Now, I ain't never met no Human t'were too big for me to pull in a wagon. You climb on the back there and let ol' Hao do the legwork. 
Defeat the Shadow of Doubt.	The Shadow of Doubt	A terrible manifestation of the sha has appeared to the south. It is trying to destroy an ancient relic, the Bell of a Thousand Whispers. This bell has never been rung in the temple's history, for it is rumored to be an ancient instrument of power. Please go and defeat this demon where it stands! We must save this relic! 
Watch your egg hatch.	It's A...	Oh my! This egg is going to hatch at any second! Well, looks like this little guy is eager to meet you. Are you ready? 
Kill Dreadweaver Avartu and recover the Divine Bell.	The Divine Bell	There's no telling what lies below, so I will lead the initial scouting party myself. If your report was correct, then the Korune mogu hid the Divine Bell in the rooms below our very feet. I have a feeling they would not have left such a precious artifact unguarded. I could use a capable Mechanic such as yourself to watch my back. Let me know when you're ready. 
Speak to Uncle Cloverleaf in Onekeg.	Path Less Traveled	The toughest roads often have the most to teach us, Mechanic. I will no doubt learn a great deal from following the path of Shaohao. Many years ago Shaohao traveled to the highest peak in Kun-Lai to seek the guidance of the Jade Serpent. I too will travel to Seeker's Point in search of wisdom. Perhaps you would be interested in a journey such as this? If so speak with Uncle Cloverleaf. He will help you prepare. 
	Vault of Souls	 
Use the Dit Da Jow or your own healing to aid 8 Injured Binan Warriors.	Hit Medicine	Our warriors are fighting to keep the yaungol at bay in the Kun-Lai Pass to the northwest. Take this liniment. It is a powerful medicine that has been passed down in my family over the generations. Use the dit da jow to heal the injured warriors if you do not have healing powers of your own to use on them. 
Obtain some of the Water of Youth.	The Pools of Youth	North! Go north to the Pools of Youth. Get some of the water but be on your guard. The mogu list this as a ""high value"" target. Kang Bramblestaff will meet you there if he has not already arrived by your side. 
Recover the four stolen Sunreaver Constructs.	De-Constructed	Saurok consistently test our borders, and our constructs usually fend them off. Some constructs, however, have been defeated and dragged back to Ihgaluk Crag. I want those constructs back. No slithering lizard will steal Sunreaver property under my watch. 
Find the Blood-Revealed Map on a Zandalari Warrior.	Chasing the Storm	We need to figure out where they are taking the Thunder King's remains. It won't be possible for them to resurrect him in the Valley of the Emperors. They would need to be somewhere remote and secure. It appears that getting out of here may also prove to be a challenge....Fight your way out and look for information concerning the location of the remains. 
Slay Azzix K'tai.	The Heavens Hum With War	The mantid don't ever make my job easy, but now they've gone too far. We can fend off the occasional attack from Kor'vess, but now... now they're starting to surround us. What's worse, they're draining the amber from our tree. This will not stand! We need that amber! To make beer! They've dug a burrow into the south side of the tree. I'm short-handed here. Could you take care of them for me? 
Use the Bag of Clams to feed 8 Coldwhisker Otters in Lonesome Cove.	You Otter Know	You know what happened to the bait in those pots? Otters. That's what happened. They prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough. The otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots. Toss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there. 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	Hero's Call: Dread Wastes!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The Shado-Pan are attempting to stop the mantid army from invading the entirety of Pandaria. You can reach Bowmistress Li by securing a kite and flying to the Serpent's Spine. Glory to the Alliance! 
Speak with Chen Stormstout and listen to his story.	Broken Dreams	Yes, I found the Stormstout Brewery... although I didn't exactly get the warm reception I expected.<Chen pours himself a mug of ale.>Do you want to hear the story? 
Obtain 10 Emperor Tern Eggs, 4 Whitefisher Crane Eggs, and 1 Hornbill Strider Egg.	A Taste For Eggs	I can sense your anxiety, but you are not ready yet. Your training must continue before you perform the final test. As for your task... I need you to fetch me some eggs. Yes, eggs. The marshland atop the hills to the east is home to a number of birds, all of which are generally peaceful in nature. You should have no trouble gathering enough eggs to last me several weeks. 
Ask Gardener Fran, Gai Lan, and Den Mudclaw for hops.	Hop Hunting	With Li Li fetching grain, and Mudmug handling our water, all we need is hops, and some good wood barrels. I'll handle the barrels... but I need you to gather the hops. I don't know much about the hops from this land, but I'm sure the nearby farmers have something worth brewing with. Go see what you can rustle up. 
Collect 12 Arrows for Commander Hsieh.	All of the Arrows	As soon as their reinforcements arrive, the yaungol are going to overrun our position here. If they do that, the village will be lost. Would you be willing to retrieve as many arrows off the battlefield as you can carry? I have a plan that just might save us with your help. 
Speak with Farmer Chow at the Chow Farmstead in Kun-Lai Summit.	Trouble on the Farmstead	I... I escaped from Farmer Chow's, to the southeast of here. It's been taken over by yaungol, but the old man and his wife just won't give it up! Please, go there and help him out. Maybe if you do, he'll be willing to send some folks back here and help you guys farm up some food for the new town? 
Destroy any 14 Terracotta Warriors or Terracotta Guardians.	Deanimate the Reanimated	I've got much to do here, George. I could use your help. There's a place to the northwest. The pandaren here call it Mogujia. Something's causing the statues there to animate, and our pandaren friends here are pretty spooked about it. If they're not dealt with soon, we might have a serious problem. We just moved in. It's not like we can afford to fight a war with an army of statues right now. 
Kill 15 Grookin Reinforcements or Slingtail Recruits.	Let Them Burn	Advance scouts report that the hozen at the Slingtail Pits are amassing with reinforcements from their tribes to the north. Our forces are gathered for battle on the ridge to the northwest. They are just waiting for you. Now is the time to show them what we are made of. Now is the time to destroy them indefinitely. 
Use 3 Shan'ze Ritual Stones to beckon a Champion of the Thunder King, and then kill him.	Setting the Trap	Take these 3 ritual stones to the location I have marked on your map. There, you will find a Shan'ze ritual object that you can use to beckon one of their powerful allies. You will need capable friends at your side for this trap to work. Do not go alone, for these will be some of the Thunder King's most powerful servants. When your enemy shows itself, show no mercy. 
Slay mogu commanders.	Cut Off the Heads	Okay. We're stuck in the middle of three mogu armies, and Uncle Chen is too hurt to move yet. It's not hopeless though. We have the chance to take out the leaders of these armies. Maybe that will slow them down or distract them long enough for us to get back to the gate! See if you can get out there and take down the biggest, baddest mogu you can find. Those will be the commanders. 
Assist Master Angler Ju Lien in Soggy's Gamble.	Reeltime Strategy	I never thought I'd see the day, but for the first time since... well, EVER, Master Angler Ju Lien asked for some help with his lines. Apparently the sea is going crazy today and he can't keep up. See if you can give him a hand. He's fishing just south of here. 
Use the Bronze Claws to mount 8 Shan'ze Cloudrunners. Attack them to free them of their corruption.	Riding the Storm	Shan Bu, the leader of the Shan'ze, is performing some kind of dark ritual at the summit of the island to the northwest. We believe that the subjugated Shan'ze Cloudrunners are powering the spell. How, we still do not know. We believe that the Shan'ze Cloudrunners can still be saved from the corruption that taints them. Take these bronze claws. Use them to mount the back of a Shan'ze Cloudrunner. Attack them. Beat some sense back into their heads! 
Speak with Farmhand Bo and Elder Tsulan in the Yaungol Advance.	Westwind Rest	<Admiral Taylor winces in pain.>Jade Forest was a disaster. Anduin's gone. We lost some good people. We didn't stop the Horde from advancing into the continent. But I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these ""yaungol"", no? I hear yaungol sacked Westwind Rest, a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town. We help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the Allliance. 
Listen to Kiryn's report.	Scouting Report: On the Right Track	MOST of what Riko said is true. We didn't dare pursue Gorrok - the Horde's numbers here are far too few. Our forces can only sustain so many losses, and frankly, we don't know how powerful that witch really is. Let me pick up where the hozen left off... 
	A Dish for Gina	 
	A Dish for Haohan	 
Put Nahassa out his misery.	Misery	While you are in the water below, you should slay Nahassa, the mortbreath patriarch. He suffers. I can feel his death cries ululating up to the surface of the lagoon. Find his cave, and put him out of his misery. Not because it will solve Marista's crocolisk problem. Simply out of mercy. 
Help Anduin Wrynn find the Monkey King in the Valley of Emperors.	The Monkey King	Ever since the Horde captured the Divine Bell I have been searching for a means to counter its power. My research got as far as this tomb. I am going inside. If you follow me, I will share the rest as we go. If we get separated, meet me back here at the entrance to the tomb. Speak to me when you are ready to proceed. 
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane atop the Pedestal of Hope.	Ellia Ravenmane: Redemption	Ellia Ravenmane, your rival, has returned. She demands that you meet her atop the Pedestal of Hope. You need to understand, George... something horrible has happened to her. She has changed. You will see for yourself when you arrive at the pedestal. Good luck, George. 
Light the Incense Bundle at the Circle of Stone.	Family Tree	So there you have it, traveler, or as much of it as would make for a proper introduction, hmm? What of you, then? Are your people so much different than mine? Surely, there must be things we share in common. Let us see... 
Bring the Ooze-Covered Amber to the Shado-Pan at the Serpent's Spine.	Reflections in Amber	<A viscous dark ooze drips from this large chunk of amber. Attempting to wipe it off is futile, as the ooze is seemingly created by the amber itself. As you hold it, unintelligible whispers fill the back of your mind. The Shado-Pan will surely want to examine it.> 
Collect healing waters from the four Sacred Bowls in the Den of Sorrow.	Sacred Waters	I appreciate you coming all this way to save me, but Ren is gravely injured. The old pandaren had no reason to help me, yet still he risked his life to save my own. Before the fever set in, he mentioned that there are healing waters in the cave just down the hill. It is dangerous, but I will do anything to help my friend. Will you help me retrieve the waters? 
Slay 8 Mortbreath crocolisks at Kea Krak.	Sudden, Unexpected Crocolisk Aggression	Normally, my day consists of catching fish, and then eating the fish I caught, followed by sleeping. Note that I did not include ""fight with a crocolisk"" in that list of activities. You look like a handy Mechanic. Can you go get rid of some of these crocolisks, so I can get back to my regular routine? The crocolisks normally keep to themselves up at Kea Krak, to the northwest. 
Rescue the three captured Kirin Tor agents within the Ghost Iron Mines, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.	On Her Magic-ey Secret Service	Under orders from Jaina herself, some of our agents attempted to sneak past mogu lines to find out what was going on in the mines. They were captured, and are being subjected to who-knows-what kind of awful tortures. You must free them and kill whoever captured them. We don't leave anyone behind! 
Bring the ""Earth-Slasher"" Master Plow to Farmer Yoon at Sunsong Ranch or Halfhill Market.	"The ""Earth-Slasher"" Master Plow"	<The box art depicts a pandaren farmer of impossible physique standing proudly astride a widening rift in the earth, a mighty plow in his grasp. Cubs wrestle playfully on his shoulders and dangle from his muscular arms. At his side, a stoic female - of equally impossible physique - balances a massive, overflowing cornucopia gracefully on her head while kicking a virmen in the face.>""The Earth-Slasher. Master the land. Master your life."" 
Drink the Potion of Mazu's Breath.	Mazu's Breath	Here to help, are ya? Well, first thing's first.<Arie rummages through her pockets for a moment before producing a small vial of glowing blue fluid.>Here it is! ""Mazu's Breath."" Cap'n's own formula. What? You thought I'd send you out to sea without a means of breathin'? I need deckhands, not corpses! Down the hatch with it, green. This'll give you a fighting chance out there on the shelf. 
Frighten 12 Hatchling Skyscreamers by running near them.	Preventing a Future Threat	The creatures the Zandalari ride don't start out so big, nor do they start out the vicious and loyal creatures they become. If you can frighten some of the hatchling skyscreamers away from the beach, perhaps they will have a chance at a real life. 
	A Dish for Sho	 
Use the Klaxxi Tuning Fork on the Ancient Amber Chunk in the Terrace of Gurthan.	Preserved in Amber	Take... this...<The dying mantid struggles to outstretch his arm. In his mangled grasp rests a metal fork with two long, thin prongs and an ornately jeweled handle.>Awaken... the Wind-Reaver...It is the only way... to end the swarm. 
Find Sarannha Skyglaive at the Ruins of Korune. Speak to Fennie Hornswaggle at Lion's Landing for transportation.	The Ruins of Korune	It's time for our boldest move yet, George. Since you acquired intel on the location of the Divine Bell, we've amassed a top team to excavate the artifact without delay. Commander Sarannha Skyglaive leads the expedition into the northern-most reaches of Kun-Lai Summit. Join them at once, and use whatever skills you need to make the endeavor a success. Good luck, Mechanic. I don't need to tell you how important this mission is to the Alliance. Speak to Fennie. She'll get you there quickly. 
Collect 1 Sweet Lakemelon from Haohan Mudclaw, 1 Fuzzy Peach from Gina Mudclaw, 1 Black Cherries from Fish Fellreed, and 1 Red Radish from Farmer Fung.	The Beginner's Brew	Can you keep a secret, George? I've been trying my hand at brewing. All I've got is this old hand-made still, but it still works pretty good. I've got an idea for a new brew, but I need some ingredients. I'm awful shy around the townsfolk, but I've seen you making friends all around. Would you be willing to ask the farmers for some ingredients for me? 
Gather 1000 Timeless Coins and introduce yourself to Mistweaver Ai and Mistweaver Ku.	Time In Your Hands	Inhabitants of this strange island barter with a special currency, immune from the fickle fluctuations of time. You would do well to gather as many of these ""timeless coins"" as possible! They can be found hidden away in small caches, or gathered from creatures all around the island. Larger, rarer creatures are a better source of coins - you may find it profitable to venture forth as part of a group. Introduce yourself to Mistweavers Ai and Ku across the Celestial Court, and gather some coins for me. 
Find Ang Thunderfoot.	Low Turnip Turnout	Your help here is appreciated, George. I'd like to give you another job, if you're interested. My son, Ang, runs the small farm just down this hill. He should have brought me some fruits and vegetables this morning, but I haven't seen him all day. Would you go down there and see what's going on? 
Destroy 6 Lightning Rods in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Lightning Crashes	The Zan-Tien like to claim mastery over the power of storms, yet they resort to machines to harness lightning from the sky. Show these pretenders that the true power of storm and thunder comes from within. Break their toys, and see how they fare without. 
Light 8 Lucky Burlap Incense sticks along the road to One Keg.	Roadside Assistance	A luckydo remembers to bring incense on a journey in to the mountains. The smellier the luck the better. Can you journey up the road to One Keg and light the incense you find along the way? This will give good fortune to grummles that must travel the road. Brother Lintpocket can give you many rewards. Speak to him when you arrive. 
Protect a group of grummles from the Burlap Waystation to the Kota Basecamp. At least one grummle must survive. If you lose your grummles, you can search the Burlap Trial or return to the Burlap Waystation and wait for the next group to leave.	The Burlap Trail: To Kota Basecamp	This here's hozen lands. Very dangerous. But grummles must trek through. Supplies must reach the Serpent's Spine. Go, protect the next wave of grummles on their trek to Kota Basecamp. If at least one survives, good fortune will find its way to you. 
Tear a page from the open book to give to Lorewalker Cho.	It Was Almost Alive	A ritual took place here, and from the looks of it wasn't successful. Among the abandoned items a book lies open. The text on the pages is foreign to you. Carrying the whole book may be difficult, but a single page might be enough. If you can get the page to Lorewalker Cho he may be able to tell you what it says. 
Collect 5 Big Bags of Poop.	Pooped	<As you approach the pen, the serpent zips into a corner and hides.>As it looks at you with bashful eyes, you can tell that someone has gotten out of its pen and had... an accident. Well, at the rate that the serpent's been eating, it had to come out the other end... somewhere. You had better find the serpent's poop and clean it up before the Serpent Masters find out. 
Plant 8 White Turnip Seeds on Sunsong Ranch.	Work Order: Golden Lotus I	<Yoon kept this order request short.>The Golden Lotus have requested a large number of white turnips. Their request mentioned something about trouble-making sprites wreaking havoc on Mistfall Village. Apparently the sprites don't like turnips! 
Bring the Massive Kyparite Core to Ambersmith Zikk at Klaxxi'vess.	Kypa'rak's Core	<As the ringworm tumbles apart, a massive chunk of organic kyparite falls from its core. Someone at Klaxxi'vess will want to see this.> 
Speak with Sapmaster Vu at The Brewgarden in Dread Wastes.	A Not So Friendly Request	Scouts have reported a non-mantid presence near Kor'vess. Their intrusion and their theft of amber would normally be dealt with swiftly, but our forces are needed elsewhere. This task seems suited to you, Wakener. You will convince them to leave this land, or you will destroy them in the name of the Klaxxi'va. 
Speak with High Elder Cloudfall at the banquet grounds in the Tian Monastery.	The Great Banquet	The banquet should be starting any time now. Go find the High Elder and pay your respects. I'll be right behind you. 
Collect 12 Root Vegetables and 1 Cast Iron Pot.	... and the Pot, Too!	Sure, I'm willing to help you guys out. But we need to eat, too! I don't even have a pot to cook in! Let alone ingredients to put in it! Here's a list of the things that I need. Now get! 
Defeat Shan Bu.	The Fall of Shan Bu	Long ago, Lei Shen found a rare clutch of storm dragon eggs. One of these creatures - Nalak - was particularly brutal, and Lei Shen took it for his own. The Thunder King's servant, Shan Bu, works to resurrect Lei Shen's dragon, Nalak. We must defeat Shan Bu and, if we are able, prevent him from resurrecting the dragon. 
Kill 6 Mistblade Rippers.	Mistblade Destruction	Korven has told me of his findings. There is an enormous amber deposit sitting at the bottom of the Lake of Stars. Unfortunately, a hostile saurok tribe lives at the edge of the lake, and revere the amber as their own. They will not allow us to enter their territory easily. Go south to the lake. Kill the Mistblade saurok, so that we can more easily harvest the nearby amber. 
Rescue Brother Yakshoe.	Lucky Yakshoe	While you were gone, I saw a group of grummles coming down the Burlap Trail. It was led by my Brother Yakshoe. But then the Knucklethumps attacked. They took my brother and his grummles north. Please, $p! Save my brother. He always has bad fortune and no luck, but he is my brother. Look for him at the alter in front of Fort Silverback. 
Protect Pei-Zhi during his ritual at the Terrace of Ten Thunders.	To Bridge Earth and Sky	We are ready to open the tan-chao and guide all of these spirits back to peace. If I may, I would have your assistance once more. The mogu will surely sense the ritual taking place and will do everything in their power to halt it. I need only a few moments without interference, and once the path is open it will surge too greatly to be closed. If you are willing to help one more time, please accompany me to the ritual site. 
Collect the Waterspeaker's Staff, Ceremonial Robe, Jade Crown, and Rosewood Beads from Slingtail Stickypaws.	The Elder's Instruments	Oh dear, oh dear... The Elder mustn't find out! I must have left the Elder's ceremonial instruments behind during the escape. But... Moonwater Retreat is crawling with hozen by now! What sort of Pearlkeeper am I, to have lost them so carelessly?<The old jinyu buries his face into his hands.>Stranger, could you find it in your heart to help me? 
Kill the Darkwoods Faerie.	In Sprite Of Everything	The sprites of Shan'ze Dao have always been capricious tricksters, but now they have fallen under the mogu's influence. Even as we speak, they gather under a new leader. We cannot allow this to happen. Their mischievous pranks were one thing, but united, their dark magic is too powerful and too dangerous to comprehend. Take out their leader before it is too late. 
Meet up with Chen Stormstout at the entrance of the Stormstout Brewery.	Knocking on the Door	Now, onward to the Stormstout Brewery! It's high time that I was reunited with the rest of the Stormstouts... and what better way to reunite than over a few mugs of ale? You know where the brewery is, right? Just follow this road to the west. You can't miss it. Of course, you're free to share the road with us - we'll be leaving any moment now. 
Speak with General Nazgrim at Binan Village in Kun-Lai Summit.	General Nazgrim has Awakened	It would seem that your General Nazgrim has awakened from his injuries. He and his people are upstairs in the apothecary's house back in Binan Village. He has requested your presence. 
Collect sketches of each piece of the ancient statue.	Monstrosity	It's plain to see that this statue and the surrounding ruins are of ancient origin. Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the cataclysm. And yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea. Perhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the continent's origins. 
Stop the Spiritbinding Ritual in the Tomb of Secrets.	Breaking the Emperor's Shield	The Mogu have been scattered and sparse in number for many years. Their purpose in the valley makes sense now. With this many restless spirits they can build themselves an army using the guardians buried in each tomb. Combined with the Zandalari forces this would be devastating! The Tomb of Secrets houses elite warriors called the Emperor's Shield. They must not be resurrected! You'll find the tomb on the highest rise to the southwest. 
Kill the Master of the Forge and collect a Codex Fragment from Fleshcrafter Hoku in the Isle of Thunder.	Forge Ahead!	The forge lies ahead of you, and with it the heart of the mogu's weaponsmithing ability. And beyond that, the mogu gatekeeper, who holds the key to unlocking the gate to the next part of the city. It's time to move out! 
Listen to the Monkey King's story.	The Greatest Prank	So riddles three you answered me. Good good. The Monkey King is not so old that he tells just anyone his tricks. It was the greatest prank ever! You want to hear story of the Mallet and the Monkey? Too bad! No choice! 
Collect 6 Applebloom Cider.	Priorities!	Those ""orc"" things ransacked the brewery and made off with my family's finest barrels of cider. I know there is a war out there, but I am not a brewer who will stand idly by while his prized vintage is chugged by undeserving lips. The ""Horde"" will likely put up some resistance. Why don't you put that weapon to good use and help me recover my cider? 
Kill Korvexxis with the aid of Taoshi.	Taoshi and Korvexxis	Taoshi is setting up an ambush for one of the mantid leaders on the south side of Sik'vess. She is tasked with retrieving his crystal so that we can use it to open the door. Two are stronger than one. I want you there to make sure it goes smoothly. 
Infiltrate Stormsea Landing and open the courtyard gate from within. Speak with Taoshi to begin the mission.	Decisive Action	Zandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from Zandalar to bolster Lei Shen's army. If we can capture the palace shipyard, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure. I have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army. 
Collect 10 Sturdy Needles.	Regeneration Takes Time	Vol'jin would be dead if he were any race other than a troll. His regeneration is impressive, but it is being blocked by a poison. We need to cleanse this poison so that he can regenerate the damage. Take to the skies and travel southeast. Across the mountain tops of the Secret Aerie you will find needle sprites. Bring me some of the hardest needles from them you can find. With them I can attempt an acupuncture technique that should purge the poison from his body and accelerate his regeneration. 
Assist Lorekeeper Cho in performing the Binding of Ba-Shon.	The Tongue of Ba-Shon	Thank you for coming, $p. I am sorry to have been so cryptic, but I could not risk alerting the mogu to my work here. They are seeking something in the valley. Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power. I could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own. The Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself. I think I'm ready to begin, if you are. 
Defeat the Streetfighter.	Round 1: The Streetfighter	Welcome, challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes. Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round. Fight with strength, fight with honor. 
Kill Adjunct Ek'vem, Adjunct Ikkess, Adjunct Suruz, and Adjunct Tsikzi, and then free Xaril the Poisoned Mind.	Beneath the Heart of Fear	The Klaxxi have detected the existence of another paragon, Wakener. This one was kept well-hidden from us, and for good reason. The Empress already has possession of this one, and her adjuncts work to destroy it even now. They are performing their sorcery in a chamber deep beneath the palace, and they must be stopped. We hold Klaxxi'vess. You must go in our stead. Find the entrance to their chamber from the ledge to the west. 
	FLAG - Rikktik's Tick Remover	 
Kill 12 Krik'thik attackers at the Gao-Ran Battlefront.	The Endless Swarm	Gao-ran's men need help down on the southern front. If you want to stand by the Shado-Pan, that's where you should do it. 
Kill Vess-Guard Na'kal outside the Heart of Fear.	Shortcut to Ruin	There is a champion among the loyalists, Vess-Guard Na'kal, whose strength comes not from experience or development, but from genetic modification. He was meant to be an example of the future of mantid - the sick idea that we can be born strong, without earning it. He's a mockery of my work! Gene augmentation was meant for mature, post-swarm veterans ONLY! End him. Perhaps it will serve as a lesson to Grand Empress Shek'zeer that taking shortcuts leads to ruin. 
Return with Hawkmaster Nurong to Taran Zhu at Rensai's Watchpost.	Heroes of the Shado-Pan	You said that Taran Zhu is in Townlong and was asking for me? Must be something important... 
	A Dish for Chee Chee	 
	A Dish for Jogu	 
Fly your War Serpent near Pure Water Springs, then douse 6 Void Flames with the water carried in its mouth.	Flames of the Void	Do you see the violent black and white flames erupting all around the temple? The greater our doubt, the stronger they rage. Unchecked, they will devour the entire temple. We have but one hope. Take flight on one of our war serpents. Fly it near the pure springs of water, and then douse the fires with water from the pools. 
Collect 3 Saltback Meat and feed them to your hatchling companion.	Feeding Time	<The serpent darts forward and bites your fingers.>Ouch! It seems, without a doubt, that the little beast is hungry. You recall that some meaty-looking turtles can be found on the wild cloud serpent island to the northeast. Perhaps some turtle meat will fill the hatchling's voracious appetite. 
Speak with Kromthar to obtain a ride to Dalaran.	The Situation In Dalaran	The night elves learned that the Divine Bell was stolen. This much we anticipated. However, they've also found out that the ""neutral"" Sunreavers of Dalaran were complicit. Now, we've got a situation. I need you to go to Dalaran. Speak with Kromthar for a ride. You are to rendezvous with Grand Magister Rommath once you arrive. 
Plant a Mogu Pumpkin in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	A Pumpkin-y Perfume	I heard a rumor around the market that Gina Mudclaw loves the smell of pumpkin blossoms. Maybe if I grow some pumpkins in my farm, she might come and visit a little more often. Could you plant a pumpkin for me? 
Heal 8 Injured Gao-Ran Blackguards.	Back on Their Feet	George, I could use your help. With their long shifts, our warriors down at the southern front of the battlefront are fighting to the point of exhaustion, and many of them have been exposed to the mantid poison. We need more people to tend to the wounded. I've prepared some bandages with the herbs you brought me, but if you have some healing skills, those might work even better. Please, George, get our men back on their feet so that they can get back here to safety. 
Kill 8 Ik'thik Harvesters on the Stinging Trail.	Crime and Punishment	The Stinging Trail nurtures young Kypari trees. The empress drains the saplings too early, outsider. They must grow before the amber can be taken. The Klaxxi'va demand punishment for this crime! It will please them if you rain death on the Ik'thik harvesters. 
Lead 5 Packless Grummles to Supply Crates near the Dooker Dome.	Grummle! Grummle! Grummle!	Now that grummles are rescued, we need to rescue our supplies. The Ook of Dook is only chief because he has supplies. Go to the Dooker Dome area north west of here. Take some grummles with you. Keep them safe and get them near supply crates. Grummles know what to do from there. Rabbitsfoot and I will meet you there. 
Speak to Fanlyr Silverthorn at Ancestral Rise in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Buried Secrets	I am told that the mogu once possessed hundreds of hidden armories full of earth-shattering weapons. When a mogu army prepared for war, they struck fear and terror into the hearts of their enemies. THIS is the knowledge I seek here on Pandaria! I have sent an expedition to study some ruins to the west, but they work as slowly as dim-witted peons! Go speak to Fanlyr Silverthorn, their leader. Tell him that I want to see results immediately. 
Report your success to Nazgrim at Domination Point in Krasarang Wilds.	Victorious Return	The portal by my side will return you safely to Domination Point. I will return behind you; I must clean up our tracks a bit before we leave, so that Proudmoore doesn't discover our involvement. 
Collect 8 Masks of Doubt.	Behind the Masks	The sha may seem unstoppable, but this is not true. Their masks seem to be the source of their power. When a sha and its mask are separated, the creature's essence is banished back to its own realm. Bring me intact masks, for I wish to study them further. Do be careful. I'm sure the sha will not part with them easily. 
	More Giant Dinosaur Bones	 
Bring the Shado-Pan Crossbow Bolt Bundle to Hawkmaster Nurong.	In Skilled Hands	George, take these crossbow bolts and then bring them to Hawkmaster Nurong at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest. Nurong is praised among all the Wukao for being a flawless shot. His efforts are credited with holding the line here for these many months. I'm hoping you can work with him and judge for yourself. He may be the final Shado-Pan we need for the hunt. 
Kill any 10 Shieldwall Forces including SI: 7 Saboteurs in and around Bilgewater Beach.	Storming the Beach	Our lumber supply is being jeopardized by constant attacks from Lion's Landing. We've been able to keep the attackers at bay, but it's time to really show 'em some muscle! Head down to the coast and start splitting some skulls! 
Defeat 25 Sra'thik attackers at Niuzao Temple.	The Siege Swells	Today's mantid swarm is among the worst I've seen. We are lucky to have Niuzao join us in battle. Help him, Mechanic. Return to the courtyard, and join in the defense of our temple. 
Report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in Stormwind Keep.	Hero's Call: Jade Forest!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Stormwind Keep in Stormwind. Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth is assembling a team for a high priority mission. Head to Stormwind Keep immediately to be briefed. Glory to the Alliance! 
Speak with High Elder Cloudfall at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.	The High Elder	How strange, to have such a foreign-looking Mechanic visiting our temple. Are you here to study? You... you look very strong. You wouldn't have any trouble getting accepted into the monastery. You should talk to the High Elder, up on the balcony above. 
Free 12 Farmstead Slaves by killing Ordo Overseers.	Farmhand Freedom	Those Ordo yaungol are working my farmhands to death! It just ain't right. Please, Mechanic, save them before it's too late. 
Speak with Loon Mai in Stoneplow.	Hope Springs Eternal	The Shado-Pan are likely dealing with similar outbreaks elsewhere in Pandaria. Seek out Loon Mai, the Shado-Pan Watch Commander in Stoneplow on the western end of the Valley of the Four Winds. Let him know that we have the situation here under control; the Shado-Pan need not send any aid. Quite the opposite, in fact - I will be sending many of my followers on pilgrimage, to bring a message of hope to those in need. Thank you again, $p. Farewell. 
Recover the Staff of Pei-Zhi and interrupt the mogu ritual in the center of the Terrace of Ten Thunders.	An Urgent Plea	<Your mind is racked with a howl. Beneath it, a wispy voice is barely audible, as if from far away.>Please... help... heart of the ruins... a ritual... conjuring......should not be here...My staff... on the altar... take it. Please hurry. 
Throw Spirit Bottles on the ground in Tideview Thicket to release 8 Beast Spirits.	Back to Nature	I'm afraid I have another favor to ask, George. The bottles you recovered contain neither the spirits of mogu ancestors nor recently slain foes; they contain spirits of beasts. It seems the spiritclaws have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra. This complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge. Take the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued. 
Rescue 5 Imprisoned Grummles by cutting them down or releasing them from cages.	The Snackrifice	They took my grummles! Hozen don't eat grummles, but yeti do. And the Knucklethumps have a yeti. Please rescue my grummles. Cut them down or let them out of cages. Rescue them any way you can. Many fortunes and rewards if you do this. 
Find the Lost Keg, the Lost Mugs, and the Lost Picnic Supplies.	I Bring Us Great Shame	I have failed my fellow brewers. I took some supplies out to the clearing, east of our tree... and I left them there. Now, with the sha corrupting the land, and the mantid on the prowl, it is too dangerous for me to bring them back. If you would help me look for them, perhaps I could regain some of my lost honor. 
	FLAG - Ancient Pandaren Tea Pot	 
Collect 6 Amber Sap.	Sap Tapping	I found a grove of young amber trees to the east, Wakener. I've placed tapping devices on these trees, but I have been too busy to retrieve the sap. I need someone to find the extractors. Activate them, then bring me samples of the amber. 
Check in with Magister Arlan, Magister Sarien, and Magistrix Vesara.	Manipulating the Saurok	I have three magisters entrenched in Ihgaluk Crag, monitoring the saurok and - where they can - turning them against the mogu. I need you to find them and see if they need any supplies or assistance. They will be concealed from view. Look for shimmering columns of light within the saurok village. 
Speak to Fisherman Haito at the Anglers Wharf in the Krasarang Wilds.	The Anglers	If you want to explore all the secrets of the deep ocean, and catch some big fish, speak to Haito at the Anglers Wharf in Krasarang Wilds. I'm sure he'd love to show you a thing or two about reeling! 
Speak to Anji Autumnlight at the Setting Sun Garrison in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	The Golden Lotus	The Golden Lotus have guarded the Vale for centuries, keeping it safe and hidden from harm. Recent events have unleashed terrible horrors upon our sacred vale, but allies of the Golden Lotus still stand against them, attempting to bring peace. If you wish to help, you had best join them at the Setting Sun Garrison. 
Return to Stormspeaker Qian at the Silent Sanctuary.	The Mantid Threat	The mantid have been corrupting their kypari trees to imbue their amber with power from N'Zoth. The swarm is enough of a menace on its own. N'Zoth could transform them into something even more dire. The Shado-Pan need to hear about this. I suggest you bring this information to your other allies as well. 
	Serpent Binding	 
Kill any 4 elite mantid at Sra'vess.	The Bigger They Come...	Killing the smaller mantid works mostly as a distraction. It forces them to replenish their numbers before they consider any serious offensive. The big ones, though - we kill a few of those, and we really disrupt operations on the island. That buys ourselves a substantial amount of time. With mantid, it's like their size is directly proportional to their importance in the empire. So kill some of the big ones for me, while you're out there. 
Recover 7 Black Market Merchandise.	Robbing Robbers of Robbers	Ah, a Mechanic. I could make good use of your skills. A convoy was struck just up the road by a band of marauding saurok. These marauders made off with some... merchandise... her ladyship, the Madam Goya, had a mind to sell. One does not steal from her ladyship. If you recover these items I will gladly provide you a finders fee. 
Kill the Ordo Embercaller, Ordo Pyromancer, Ordo Firespeaker, and Ordo Blazecaster.	In Tents Channeling	The yaungol of Fire Camp Ordo are the worst threat we're facing. I need you to head west and take out their leader. The coward is hiding in a cave, which is protected by a fire shield cast by his four underlings. Take them out and the shield will come down. You'll find them in their tents, channeling. 
Kill Water Fiends to recover Wise Mari's Staff.	The Scryer's Dilemma	Since you were so helpful at the mines, would you be willing to help us with a small problem here at the temple? Wise Mari has been complaining recently of a disturbance in his temple. The water elementals have gotten quite playful recently, and made off with his ceremonial staff. If you could help him, I would be most grateful. I may even put in a word with the Jade Serpent for you. Just follow the path to the north. 
	FLAG - Wodin's Mantid Shanker	 
Use the Totem of Harmony to exorcise sha spirits from 8 Crazed Shado-Pan Rangers. Defeat the Seething Hatreds to purify your allies.	Hatred Becomes Us	I should have suspected a sha presence earlier! We are safe as long as we stand inside the Totem of Harmony's protective wards, but many of our people were not so lucky. They were trapped outside the camp when the sha's powers manifested, and now they turn upon each other! Take one of my totems with you. Place the totem near a crazed ally to purify them, but beware. You may have to face the darkness that gripped them. 
Gather 8 Ripe Oranges from the orange groves south of Tian Monastery.	A Courteous Guest	I heard, I heard! The High Elder wants you to train with us! There's going to be a banquet for us, the trainees... and you should probably bring a gift, as a sign of courtesy. The oranges in the grove south of the temple are extra-sweet right now. Bring some back, for the banquet. 
Destroy 2 Training Bags. Follow Instructor Xann's instructions to determine which bags to attack.	Attention	Your next test also involves concentration and attention. I want you to practice your abilities on the training bags in the pit below. The bags are hung in groups of two. When I call out ""Left"", attack the bag on the left. When I call out ""Right"", attack the bag on the right. If you fail to follow my simple directions, this task will become much harder. Now beat on those practice bags until they burst, George. 
Kill Slovan.	Raid Leader Slovan	The raiders are led by a particularly violent saurok known as Slovan. The Crane Temple usually comes to our aid when he attacks but now we find ourselves outmatched and outmaneuvered. Please, Mechanic, aid us by destroying this raid leader. You can find him in his den behind the Krasari Falls. 
Find the object the Monkey King described in his riddle.	The First Riddle: Mercy	So, you wake up the Monkey King for a mallet hmmm? Answer first, these riddles three, and then the mallet you shall see. First riddle! ""Softly singing a song of pain There is a creature tortured and lame. Way down south and beyond the wall, It hides from its wikket masters' call. Seek out the creature sad and somber, And free it from its untamed amber.""Bring me the untamed amber. 
Bring beer to Zhu's Wardens, the Crane Wing Priests, the Shado-Pan, and the night elf settlers.	It Does You No Good In The Keg	I been thinkin'. We got all this beer that Chen brewed, and we got all these people that you've gathered. We should bring the two together. There's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for Pandaria. You an' I should at least bring 'em a keg or two. They might raise their mugs in victory. They might enjoy one last drink before gettin' skivvered by a mantid. Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly. 
Speak with Seamus Goldenkicks in Lion's Landing to be ported to Darnassus, then speak with Jaina once you arrive.	Darnassus Attacked?	As you know, our night elven allies moved the Divine Bell you retrieved to Darnassus for safekeeping and study. Moments ago, they portaled some Highbourne mages over here to ask for backup. Details are hazy - some sort of stealth attack on the city? I don't know what to make of it, but Jaina Proudmoore is already on the scene and I suspect they need all the help they can get. Speak to Seamus Goldenkicks over there for a quick portal to Darnassus. Find Jaina! 
Kill 7 Riverstride Jinyu.	What's in a Name Name?	So, you wanna be a hozen. Huh, wikket? Hozen defend their lands from enemies, like jinyu. Kah Kah fought many jinyu fights, and won them all. Hozen only give name name to good grookers. Go grook jinyu and maybe they call you George George. Jinyu creepin' down by the river. Ook 'em in the dooker! 
Defeat 12 Sra'thik attackers at Niuzao Temple.	The Unending Siege	The mantid continue to attack us. Their numbers ebb and flow, but they do not stop. It is no matter. The yak is stamina embodied. We will not bend to them. We will defend his home forever. Will you help us? 
Bring The Ballad of Liu Lang to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge.	The Ballad of Liu Lang	Dear $p,At long last thanks to your research we have the full Ballad of Liu Lang. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Disrupt a binding ritual by killing all ritual NPCs around either a Defiant Direhorn or a Defiant Devilsaur.	Direhorn vs Devilsaur	We have an opportunity to disrupt the Zandalari war machine as well as have a little fun in the process. Within these beast pens, a devilsaur and a direhorn are being outfitted with armor, their minds being enslaved to the Zandalari charms. Go into the camp and disrupt one of these binding rituals. It doesn't matter which one. Just kill those who are trying to bind the creature. This should let the fully armored beast run mad through the Zandalari camp. Then sit back and watch the hilarity ensue. 
Report to General Nazgrim at Domination Point in Krasarang Wilds.	A Return to Krasarang	Wherever your loyalties might lie - with Rommath and I, with Garrosh, or elsewhere - one thing is true: your acts today were truly heroic. I can arrange for your transport back to Krasarang Wilds. Speak with me if you would like passage back to Pandaria, George. 
Use the Stone Monoliths at the Circle of Bone.	If These Stones Could Speak	This is a very ancient place, traveler. Only recently have I pieced together a method of translating the forgotten language carved into these stones. Oh, the thrill of discovery! This never gets old, I assure you. Here, you are the guest. You do the honors. I insist. Use this key to unlock the secrets the stones contain. 
Speak to Ace Longpaw, then defeat him.	The Trainer's Challenge: Ace Longpaw	You are rising up the ranks of our students, George. Just as a sword must be forged through fire, so must our students test themselves against one another. Today, you will spar against one of our brightest disciples, Ace Longpaw. In order to defeat him, you will need to make use of your defensive capabilities. Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck. 
Use a Dragon Launcher to kill 50 swarming mantid.	Cutting the Swarm	The mantid numbers have been increasing since you left for the cleft. Let's put these orbs you gathered to use. Get down on the battlefront and man one of the cannons. Let none through. 
Search for Sentinel Ku-Yao.	Seeking Father	I've searched everywhere... but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still. He just needs his crossbow... then he'll be OK. I've heard that you Shado-Pan guys sometimes fight the mantid on Sra'vess. I don't have any way of getting there. If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad? 
Report to General Nazgrim in Grommash Hold.	Warchief's Command: Jade Forest!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to General Nazgrim in Orgrimmar. Recent victories in our naval battles against the Alliance strengthens our resolve. Report to Grommash Hold and assist the Horde's invasion fleet. For the Horde! 
	Zan-Tien Serpent Cage	 
	Consuming Maw	 
Destroy the Zandalari's sacrificial altars.	Heinous Sacrifice	Some of the strongest of the spiritbinders perform heinous rites to their wretched gods. We've devised a method to destroy their altars, so the difficult task will be getting to each altar alive. Venture into the depths of Za'Tual and destroy their altars. 
Listen to Riko's report.	Scouting Report: The Friend of My Enemy	We weren't only looking for Alliance, you know. We were also looking for those snooked-up, tik-flikklin' jinyu! Well, we found 'em all right... 
Collect 6 Fistfuls of Bird Guts from Bloodtalons in Dookin' Grounds.	Furious Fowl	So these guys like fish, huh? Well how about we finish what you started and make them LOVE us? I've still got some explosive powder from the wreck, just need something to attract the fish. Guts is sure to do the trick - never fails. I saw some birds flyin' around south of town. Well? Whatcha waitin' for? 
Recover the Harmonic Ointment.	The Harmonic Ointment	Legends are not born, they are made. Much like your next target, a mogu named ""The Blade."" In his bags you will find,An ointment whose sound plays with the mind. Bring this nibby ointment to the Monkey King! And with it, he shall make the mallet sing! Travel north along the wall, and when you reach the end, turn left. 
Speak to Lorewalker Cho at the Circle of Bone.	A Mile in My Shoes	Oh, where have my manners gone? Technically, I suppose I am the host here. Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself and my people before asking questions of you. 
Speak to Anduin at the Gate of the August Celestials.	The Vale of Eternal Blossoms	It's been many lifetimes since the gates to the valley were open, George. I wouldn't miss this for the world, and neither should you! Meet me at the southen edge of Kun-Lai Summit. I'll wait for you there. 
Bring The Song of the Yaungol to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge.	The Song of the Yaungol	Dear $p,Your research in to the yaungol has proven most insightful. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Bring the Gods and Monsters to Lorewalker Cho.	Gods and Monsters	Dear $p,Is it true that the mogu are really connected to the titans? I find this very hard to believe. But looking over your research, some of the truth about the mogu begins to take shape. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Kill 15 Dustback Mushans.	Mushan Mastery	Mushan! Would ya look at the size o' 'em. Old as the dirt they walk on probably. A fine trophy. If you are lookin' to test your mettle as a big game hunter, start with them. 
Search for Lorewalker Cho at the Dreamer's Pavilion in the Jade Forest.	Seek Out the Lorewalker	I see that you and your people are desperate to find your Prince Anduin. I know someone who may be able to help you, a pandaren Lorewalker who knows this land better than anyone. I cannot guarantee what kind of reception you will receive, but he will almost certainly be as curious about you as you are of him! The Lorewalker lives in the forest to the southwest. Tell him that the Pearlfin have sent you. 
Check on Sage Liao at the Zaochin Strand in Kun-Lai Summit.	Checking In	When the trolls came, they brought their mercenary... friends with them. I saw them go past us, to the fishing camp in the northwest. My cousin, a healer, lives there - can you check in with him and make sure he and his village are well? 
Collect 8 Living Amber, then feed them to Korven the Prime.	Living Amber	Liquid amber is most efficient for restoring a newly awakened paragon's strength, and is usually provided at a wakening ceremony. Unfortunately, it seems you did not receive these instructions, so we shall have to improvise. I can sense a vast quantity of fossilized amber in the lake below us. It will serve, but I am too weak to dig it up myself. Do this for me, and I will see to it that you are rewarded. 
Meet Chen Stormstout at The Sunset Brewgarden, then listen to his eulogy.	Evie Stormstout	I was too late. She was so small... and I was too late. She should be given a proper burial. A little warrior like her deserves better than this. 
Obtain 30 Funky Rotten Fish from Unga Villagers in Unga Ingoo.	Beastmaster's Hunt: The Crab	Along with the crate, you get some advice on crab hunting:Crabs are strange, primordial creatures, with wildly different motivations than you or I. Small crabs are easy to find and hunt, but the large ones hide beneath the sands, out of danger and out of our reach. To draw them out, we play on their sense of smell. The Unga villagers to the southeast allow their fish to ferment before they eat them. Bring enough rotten fish together, and you will catch yourself a colossal crab. 
Give peace to 10 Fear-Stricken Sentinels by closing their eyes and placing them on their bellies.	Give Them Peace	I overheard. Our secret is out, then. When I learned that the mantid had burrowed beneath our temple, I reacted hastily. I sent dozens of guardians to defend what they could, but they were not prepared. They succumbed to fear, and never returned. A pandaren deserves to die embracing the ground, as he does in sleep... not flat on his back with his eyes transfixed in terror. Please, George. Give them the peace they deserve. 
Bring Heart of the Mantid Swarm to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge.	Heart of the Mantid Swarm	Dear $p,While we appreciate your efforts to investigate the lore of Pandaria, the documents you sent us on the mantid managed to rob me of several nights sleep. Terrifying stuff. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Speak with Deck Boss Arie at Soggy's Gamble in Dread Wastes.	Gambling Problem	If this war is to be won we cannot afford to leave anything unchecked, outsider. There is a disturbance along the coast that needs to be investigated. The presence there is not our kind and are of no value to us. However, their supplies could prove very valuable. If there is anything of use there we must get to it before the empress. 
Free 6 Jinyu Prisoners or Alliance Prisoners.	Freeing Our Brothers	You may be an outsider, but you and I have a common enemy in the hozen. Many members of my tribe are trapped in cages nearby. I have also seen your... Alliance... soldiers as well. I cannot leave without freeing my brethren, just as you cannot leave yours. The Slingtail hold the keys to those cages. Find the keys and free our friends. 
Empower 6 Sunreaver Perimeter Wards.	Bolstering the Defenses	This island holds many dangers for us. Threats loom from every side. We must defend our hold on these shores at all costs. Perimeter wards have been placed around Dawnseeker Promontory. By default they will inflict damage, but are not fatal in their attack. Now is not the time to be merciful, Human. The perimeter wards need to be deadly! Go and empower the perimeter wards surrounding our camp. 
Listen to Riko's report.	Scouting Report: Hostile Natives	I bet I know your first question: ""What the ook happened to Sergeant Gorrok?"" Don't worry, don't worry. He's totally alive. Not dead or anything.<Riko shuffles uncomfortably.>Well, we THINK he's alive, but he ALSO might be very, very dead.<Riko looks into your eyes for approval.>Fine! Let me tell you exactly what happened. 
Obtain the Blade of Kz'Kzik and the Blade of Ilikkax.	Rending Daggers	Forget about them, and forget their BREW. We've got real work to do. The scroll mentions ""rending daggers of the great ones"". I've got a feeling I know where to find them. A pair of mantid lieutenants patrol the Horrid March, to the south. Each one carries a ceremonial dagger. Bring those daggers back here, George. We may be on the brink of something big. 
Begin Kovok's training by feeding him 6 Succulent Turtle Filets found on the Brineshell Snappers in the Briny Muck.	Feed or Be Eaten	After years of working with the Kunchong I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection. I had just begun training Kovok when I was chosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential. I'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned; if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit. First, you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this. 
Plant 8 Green Cabbage Seeds on Sunsong Ranch.	Work Order: Shado-Pan I	<Yoon's writing seems rushed. He must have been excited.>The Shado-Pan want crops from you! What an honor indeed! A request came in this morning for green cabbages. Apparently, they make a rather tasty cabbage soup with them. Only the finest will do for the Shado-Pan! 
Kill Oracle Hiss'ir and 10 Muckscale tribe members.	The Kunchong Whisperer	To really connect with Kovok you need to challenge him mentally and physically. You must respect his strength and intelligence; only then will he allow you to really train him. The muckscale tribe may provide an adequate test of his abilities and with you there he shouldn't be in danger. Additionally, this will allow us to decrease their numbers in the Briny Muck. 
Slay 14 Ik'thik mantid in Stoneplow.	Stemming the Swarm	I'm not from here. I've never even BEEN here before today. But even I can tell you that something's wrong. That wall over there was built to keep mantid off of pandaren lands. Now, the mantid are sending their winged scouts over the top, as if the wall wasn't even there! The only reason those spindly scouts aren't dying is because they're attacking farmers, not soldiers. They wouldn't stand a chance against someone like you. 
Save 6 Silver Covenant Scouts or Sunreaver Scouts.	Soul Surrender	We assault the mogu at the Court of Bones, but I fear we merely send them fodder for their abominable rituals. The mogu do not merely kill their prisoners - they steal their souls and imbue them in machinations of stone, or reforge the fallen into ghostly tools of war. Alliance or Horde, it matters not. We cannot allow the mogu to bolster their numbers. Go into the crypts. Free any prisoners that are still living. 
Gather 6 Barrels of Yaungol Fire Oil.	A Terrible Sacrifice	I have an idea, and... am prepared to make a terrible sacrifice. As much as I know that we need my stout brew, to fortify our defenders for the long-term security of the Ox Gate...It is too painful to discuss details now, but please - while you are up here defending the wall, gather the barrels of oil they are using to light their arrows. We will need them. 
Speak with Inkmaster Wei.	Find the Boy	Have you seen my son, Lo? He was here a moment ago and I told him we were leaving today. I'm sure he's off trying to woo that young Syra Goldendraft. That is the very reason we need to leave! No son of mine is going to run off with a Goldendraft! I'm going to search around here for them. I do keep catching those two sneaking off to the Arboretum. Any chance you could head out there and look for them? 
Plant 8 Scallion Seeds on Sunsong Ranch.	Work Order: Sunreaver Onslaught I	<Yoon keeps the details of this order short, but detailed.>Another request has come through for the Horde. The Sunreaver Onslaught, located out on the Isle of Thunder, has requested a bushel of scallions. Though this Horde and Alliance conflict still gets my fur in a bristle, I won't turn away a hungry stomach. 
Bring the Krasari Elder to Huntsman Blake.	Beastmaster's Quarry: The Tiger	The elder cat is alive, but stunned. You should bring it back to Huntsman Blake before it wakes up. 
	FLAG - Box of Supplies	 
Find the Malted Cave Barley at the base of the Winds' Edge.	The Quest for Better Barley	Looking for sweet grain? My father once mentioned a malted cave barley that sounds about right. If you are willing to brave the peril, there is an ancient cave at the base of the Winds' Edge south of here. There is even an old lift my father made when he would travel into the jungle. In the cave is a bush as old as my family. From that bush you can pluck a grain so sweet it will humble your senses. Just watch out for its guardians. 
Kill 6 Animated Warriors.	The Sleepless Legion	The Shan'ze are animating an army from the statues in the center of the isle, an army that batters our defenses day and night. Destroy any of the walking statues you see. Our defenders will greatly appreciate it. 
Speak to Elder Lusshan, Pearlkeeper Fujin, Instructor Sharpfin, and Ot-Temmdo at Pearlfin Village.	The Pearlfin Situation	I've been thinking. We are cut off from support and a long way from home. Although these Pearlfin jinyu mistrust our presence, they do not appear to be hostile. If we could convince them that we are their friends, an alliance between our races could prove extremely valuable. George, you must go speak to the jinyu around the village. Convince their leaders that we are not to be feared, and that we only wish for peace. 
	A Marsh Lily for Farmer Fung	 
	FLAG - Stolen Sprite Treasure	 
Plant a Red Blossom Leek in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	Red Blossom Leeks, You Make the Croc-in' World Go Down	Grandpa once told me that the smell of leeks will keep crocolisks off of your property. He must have had a point... he always grew leeks, and I never saw a crocolisk anywhere NEAR his farm. We're pretty far from the water... but I suppose you can never be too sure. 
Take Dog to visit the hot geysers, the whale corpse, and the wreck of the Mist-Hopper on the Shelf of Mazu.	Walking Dog	Dog ain't my ""pet."" He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know. But I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya? He loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows. He absolutely has to... er... ""leave his mark"" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf. Oh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce. 
Obtain 5 Pristine Golden Crownfeathers and a Pristine Jet Crownfeather.	Beastmaster's Hunt: The Crane	Along with the snare, you get some advice on crane hunting:The greatest cranes of the Krasarang Wilds are not tempted by simple things like food. You will need to play on the creatures' emotions if you wish to draw them from their hiding places in the jungle. Cranes abound on both the Cradle of Chi-ji and the Narsong Spires, both of which can be found east of here. Pluck those cranes' quills, then place them in a visible spot near the Crane Temple. Your quarry will come running to you. 
Rearm 8 Shado-Pan Spike Traps.	Trap Setting	Good to meet you, Mechanic. We have traps all along the pass to help us catch mantid that might be sneaking through, but their numbers have been so great that most of the traps have already been triggered. Taoshi said you might be able to reset some of them while you're out there. Can you help? 
Speak with Huntsman Blake at Lion's Landing in Krasarang Wilds.	A Colossal Victory	The crab has fallen. 
Clean off the Empty Bookshelf.	Your Private Collection	Pandaria is rich with history, legends, stories, and lore of every sort. While you are traveling throughout the world I would ask that you keep an eye open for artifacts and pieces of information that you feel would be pertinent to our work here. When you accumulate enough knowledge, we will compile it in to a volume for your personal collection here. You can, of course, return whenever you like to review the volumes we are making for you. 
Destroy 10 Sha-Infested Prowlers in Honeydew Glade.	Prowler Problems	The animals have all gone crazy! Normally the prowlers steer clear of the village, but now we can't seem to keep them away. I've never seen them act this way before! The mayor has summoned in the Shado-Pan, but they're not all here yet. Can you take care of those prowlers before they maul one of our farmers? 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	Warchief's Command: Dread Wastes!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The Shado-Pan are attempting to stop the mantid army from invading the entirety of Pandaria. You can reach Bowmistress Li by securing a kite and flying to the Serpent's Spine. Destiny calls! 
Speak to Ogo the Elder at Niuzao Temple in the Townlong Steppes.	Defense At Niuzao Temple	Niuzao Temple, far to the west, is under attack by the mantid. The great Celestial holds them back for now, but he cannot stand alone forever. Go and help the defenders, Mechanic. The Temple must not fall! 
Obtain a Yak Statuette from the inside of a Kunzen hozen hut.	A Gift For Fish	That Fish Fellreed is kind of weird. First of all, her name's Fish. That's weird. Once you talk to her, though, she's really a nice lady. Did you know that she's an animal lover? I've got an idea! The Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, make little animal statues and put them in their huts to scare off bad guys. I bet Fish would LOVE something weird like that! 
Speak with Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.	Get My Results!	Ah, $p. The Warchief has instructed me to dispatch you to Silvermoon. He grows impatient with the progress of Lor'themar's research and feels they might benefit from your... unique... experiences with the mogu. Go to Silvermoon and demand that Lor'themar increase the speed of his research. 
Locate and waken the mantid paragon in The Clutches of Shek'zeer.	In Her Clutch	The crystal sings to the Klaxxi. They sense a paragon in the clutch, east of the tower. Clutch-keepers are trying to pollute this one. The Klaxxi will not permit this. Go and find the paragon. Place your hands on his chamber, and the Klaxxi will channel their whispers through you to break him free. Protect him if you can. 
Find Archmage Aethas Sunreaver outside of Ihgaluk Crag.	Ihgaluk Crag	Aethas has taken over at Ihgaluk Crag, to the southeast, continuing his effort to turn the Saurok against the Zandalari and mogu. Go to him, and help in any way that you can. 
Use the old sheepskin anywhere in the Skyrange or Kunzen Village, then kill Krungko.	A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing	AAAIIIIEEUUGGHHHH!!!! This is the last straw! Those stupid hozen on the mountain killed my SHEEPIE! I know exactly who did this, and it is time for REVENGE. If you are willing to help me, take this old sheepskin. Use it to disguise yourself anywhere on the mountain to the north, wait for that little dooker Krungko to come out of hiding, and then break his bones! 
Speak with Lorewalker Cho at Onekeg in Kun-Lai Summit.	Cho's Missive	One of those grummles came by and said that Lorewalker Cho sent for you. You should go ahead and meet up with him, he might have something important to say. The grummel said he's at Onekeg, to the north. 
Report to Silkmaster Tsai at the Silken Fields in Valley of the Four Winds.	Got Silk?	Strange noises comin' from over at the Silken Fields. Strange smells, too. Almost makes you think that they could use a cash-strapped Mechanic to complete a few odd jobs for 'em. Make a few pieces of gold. Or not. 
Bring the Shrouded Timewarped Coin to Mistweaver Xia on the Timeless Isle.	The Shrouded Coin	A swirling mist envelops the coin and it begins to float above your hand. The mist briefly parts to reveal a shiny new coin, yet in the next instant the coin appears worn from years of exchange. As the coin settles back in to your hand, visions of jungles and mist shrouded peaks waft into your mind, and through the vision you recognize the four Celestials gathered in the courtyard of an island. 
Collect 4 Onyx Hearts.	Onyx Hearts	The Shan'ze Serpentbinders dominate the minds of wild cloud serpents, but they also create their own dark creatures from stone, metal, blood, and ancient sorcery. Their creations, the Onyx Stormclaws, guard the island to the northwest. I wish to study the magic binding these creatures. Bring me their hearts, so that I can better understand what sorcery we are up against. 
Speak with Orbiss in the Sumprushes.	A Delicate Balance	The calling to be a Shado-pan is one to bring balance and harmony to this land. It is our duty to ensure balance is maintained, George. The yaungol activity in Townlong is threatening this balance and must be stopped before it is too late. We've had sightings of yaungol in the Sumprushes. The reports indicate they are attacking the mist lurkers in the area. Find out why and put an end to it! 
Kill Subjugator Gormal in Camp Gormal.	Maul Gormal	Thanks to you, there's a small militia of farmers hiding nearby. Hanae said something about giving them ""liquid courage"" which, I'm pretty sure, means they're sauced and ANGRY. The mogu think they can walk all over us - we'll give them a fight that will open their eyes. Follow the trail through the ruins and down to the beach. Find their leader. When you engage him, we'll be there to back you up. 
Find 8 Stolen Luckydos.	A Grummle's Luck	The yaungols stole our luckydos! Mean riders with spears took them from our caravan of brothers coming down the Burlap Trail. This is very bad fortune. If the yaungol discover the secrets of luckydos all grummles will be in big trouble. Recover our luckydos from Fire Camp Ruqin north of here and we will pay many fortunes to you. 
Slay 17 Kor'thik Mantid at Kor'vess.	Kor'thik Aggression	I'm no brewer - just looking at all those heaps of ingredients makes my head spin. Just put the brew in front of me when it's finished, thank you. No, I'm here to make sure that the brewers don't get cut in half while they're trying to make that perfect brew. It's not an easy job. The Kor'thik mantid across this basin have been attacking us nightly. If you're already heading over there, why don't you return the favor and attack a few of them? 
Kill 8 Windward Tigers or Windward Alphas.	Thinning The Pack	The past few seasons have been plentiful, and as a result, the wild tiger population on Windward Isle has exploded. The savage creatures have hunted out all the nearby game, and are beginning to encroach upon the cloud serpent nests. As a result, as the tigers thrive, the cloud serpents decline. If we are not careful, the predatory cats could completely wipe them out. We must thin the tigers' numbers, Human. 
Kill 3 Shan'ze Illusionists.	Illusions Of The Past	Mechanic, I need your strength to eliminate the Shan'ze Illusionists on Shan'ze Dao, to the northwest. It wearies me to ask of you this difficult task. The illusionists are among the strongest of the Shan'ze's elite sorcerors. They will not be easy to defeat, but I know no Mechanic who is better suited to the task. 
Unearth 7 pieces of farm equipment.	A Poor Grasp of the Basics	Virmen - they no just eat our food. They trying to start farms of their own. The problem is... well, they ookin' dumb. You no believe Muno? Last night, they break into tool sheds... steal equipment. When we wake up, we find rakes and wheelbarrows planted in ground. They was WATERING them. They was trying to GROW WHEELBARROWS. Please, while you out there, unbury our stuff. 
Speak with Master Bruised Paw, then successfully strike the Stack of Stone Blocks 5 times.	Unyielding Fists: Trial of Stone	You have accomplished much in the short time you have been here, George. I would not normally offer this test so soon... but I feel that you're ready. It is time you attempted the Trial of Stone. 
Speak with Shao the Defiant at Nectarbreeze Orchard.	An Air of Worry	My sight has long since faded, but when the wind is right I can still smell the blossoms of Nectarbreeze Orchard as if they were in my own palm. Today, though, their fragrance is muddled with smoke. Please, if you are able, check in on the orchard and see that things are okay. Perhaps my old nose is playing tricks on me. You'll find the orchard to the southwest, beyond the statue of the Jade Serpent. 
Defeat 8 Tian Pupils in sparring matches at the Tian Monastery.	Becoming Battle-Ready	Alright, Human. I'd like to see what you're really made of. You'll find my pupils all over the monastery. Challenge them to fights. Push them to their limits. They have been instructed to do the same to you. Win or lose, you both will come out of the fight stronger. 
Speak with Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine.	Dread Space	Shado-Pan marksmen keep a constant watch over the Dread Wastes from the top of the Serpent's Spine. They would surely welcome the aid of a skilled Mechanic such as yourself. Take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li. 
	Giant Dinosaur Bone	 
Plant a Juicycrunch Carrot in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	That Dangling Carrot	Grandpa always said, ""Carrots ain't nothin but a welcomin' mat for virmen."" I don't think I ever saw him grow a single carrot. For once, I disagree with Grandpa. I like to live on the edge. Plus, I like to eat carrots. I like to eat carrots on the edge. Could you get some seeds and grow one for me? 
Slay mogu in Kun-Lai Summit.	Mogu Massacre	I think this is what my friends would call a ""target rich environment."" As a nicer way of saying ""we're surrounded and probably doomed.""You know what this means. We have to kill as many of these mogu as possible! It doesn't matter how you do it, just take them out! 
Use the Vision of Time at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit.	Courting Destiny	The Vision of Time is nearly perfected, we now have much more control over the visions we seek. Your efforts have been instrumental in completing the artifact and restoring the strength of not only my flight, but also our allies in the Timewalkers. All of us are in your debt. Quite fortunately, I have located a sort of crux in time - an intersection of timeways - right here in Pandaria. Take the Vision of Time to the Temple of the White Tiger. There, in the cellars, turn the hourglass. 
Kill the Sra'thik Swarmlord at Sra'vess in Townlong Steppes.	Target of Opportunity: Sra'thik Swarmlord	While we're here, we should do one more thing. The Sra'thik Swarmlord is responsible for directing the mantid forces from the air. If we leave it alive, it's going to cause trouble for the garrison. So we're not going to leave it alive. Let's take it out, $p. 
	FLAG - Amber Encased Moth	 
Slay a Skumblade Brute, a Skumblade Saur-Priest, and a Skumblade Seadragon.	The Residents of Ihgaluk	The Skumblade threaten our people, but responding with all-out slaughter would be an overreaction. A more reasonable response to their threat would be to slay some of their tribal leaders. There will be less bloodshed, and they will still respect our perimeter. 
Duel 10 Students of Chi-Ji.	Students of Chi-Ji	Our order prides itself on excellence in combat. We hone these combat skills by dueling one another, here on the Cradle of Chi-Ji. Prove yourself in the eyes of the Red Crane. Venture south, into the center of the island, and duel with your fellow students. 
Defeat Master Boom Boom.	Round 3: Master Boom Boom	Your next challenger found his strength on a beach. Particularly in a box labeled ""dynamite.""He proves however that found strength can be as deadly as personal strength. When you are ready, face this Master Boom Boom in the Western Arena. 
Travel to Muskpaw Ranch in Kun-Lai Summit and speak with Lao Muskpaw.	Muskpaw Ranch	There's another Pandaren settlement out here, Muskpaw Ranch. I don't know if they're alright, what with everything that's been going on with the Yaungol invasion. You've been so helpful - you should go check up on them, friend! 
Slay 6 Vengeful Gurthani Spirits in the Terrace of Gurthan.	Ancient Vengeance	I can hear them howling in rage... The spirits of the Gurthani mogu I slew so long ago. They wander this ruined terrace, seeking vengeance. If they find me in this state, I will not have the strength to fend them off. Draw their attention and put them down. Finish what I started, and I will tell you who I am. 
Look through the spyglass in Rensai's Watchpost.	Buried Beneath	Taoshi set up a spyglass on the ridge edge to show me what her scouting uncovered. Go over and take a look. 
Obtain 5 Stolen Turnips and 5 Stolen Watermelons.	Taking a Crop	Alright, fine. I DON'T have everything under control here. I spent all morning fighting off virmen. I managed to clear them off of my property, but they got away with some of my crops. They took them down to the river, to the south. I have no idea what they're doing with them, but it's probably not eating them. If my father wants his delivery now, I'm going to need some help getting those crops back. Could you help me out? 
Kill 10 Baruk mogu in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	No Stone Unbroken	When the warring clans came into the Vale, the Baruk deigned themselves worthy to lay claim to the ancient grounds of Guo-Lai. They are not. Show these usurpers their place, and you may earn a modicum of favor with the Rajani. 
Gather 5 Intact Tortoise Shells.	Tortoise Mastery	Granted, tortoises are not big game but they can be mean game. They also work as the perfect bait for bigger game! Gotcher found some ol' tablets sayin' that the Torjari Pit is a sacrificin' site. The old empire used ta' feed unruly sorts to the waters as it were. Well ah mean to see me what's down in that water. Gather up some fresh tortoise shells and meet me at the pit. Let's see if ol' legends be true. 
Report to Groundskeeper Wu at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.	Groundskeeper Wu	We don't have many rules here, but we do have one particular rule that is worth remembering. If you want to eat...<Xiao's stomach grumbles audibly.>...you have to work. Groundskeeper Wu can give you your chores for the day. He's in the market, to the west. 
Destroy 7 Mana Foci around Violet Rise.	Overpowered	The Kirin Tor are using mana foci to empower their forces. We cannot allow this to continue. You'll find these foci scattered around the outskirts of Violet Rise. Use this mana crystal to destroy as many as you can. Each mana focus we destroy is another small victory for our cause. 
Slay 8 Knucklethump Smashers or Jibstabbers at Knucklethump Hole.	Thumping Knucklethump	The Knucklethump hozen have new chief, the Ook of Dook. He sees fear in the west, anger in the south, hatred in the north, and yaungols in the east. And so he sets his hozen to ravage, gathering food and supplies for coming famine. They are many Knucklethumps and dangerous. Please, Luckydo, can you defeat their fighters? 
Use the Hellscream's Fist Signal Flare near Chief Kah Kah at Grookin Hill.	Instant Messaging	Welcome, wikket! Me Kah Kah - chief of Grookin Hill hozen. Dook Ookem wanted to be chief, but good wikket grook him good - big gift to Kah Kah. Hozen has gift for good wikket too. Gift come from great crash. Hozen keep it safe for wikket. 
Obtain 10 Gifts of the Great Crane.	Gifts of the Great Crane	The cranes of Krasarang are a gift from Chi-Ji. Even the very feathers they leave behind are a gift for us to appreciate. We use these feathers to adorn our garments and to fletch arrows. But first... they must be gathered. 
Gather 7 Green Branches in the Dookin' Grounds.	Green-ish Energy	One word: Methane! We're going green. Clean burning, high availability, all natural, and will keep the druids off my back when we get back to our neck of the world. That, and I ran out of blasting powder...So, I need your help, George. No, no, I wouldn't ask you to do the dirty work - especially not in front of the general. I'll collect these 'deposits' myself. You gather up some wood for an outhouse - I'm thinking long-term here! 
Obtain Metal Brew.	The Second Riddle: Fellowship	You want to stop the Divine Bell? We need the mallet first. You want the mallet? We need to be friends first. You want to be friends? We need a Metal brew first. You want a Metal brew? You need to go to the Shrine of Fellowship first. You want to go to the Shrine of Fellowship? Great! It's in the Jade Forest southeast of the Tian Monastery. Ring the bell and get the Monkey King some brew while there. Oh... you may have to fight for it. 
Drink the Memory Wine and witness Shan Kien's Past.	Memory Wine	The tincture is ready. Now, drink. 
Finish the battle for the Ox Gate.	Finish This!	We've heard back from Suna, on the wall. Something's going on...It looks like they are preparing for their final push. It's time to finish this, friend. 
Obtain 8 pieces of Fragrant Corewood.	Bound With Wood	<Vu eyes the recipe.>Hmm... ""bound with wood"". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes... but not wood. We have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the mantid... but their remains should suffice for our recipe. 
Obtain 7 Chunks of Mystery Meat from the local wildlife.	Mystery Meatloaf	We've been gettin' complaints right and left that the Boss-Lady gets all the good grub and leaves the scraps for the others. Between you and I, they may be onto somethin' here. I don't even get to eat as good as she does! We need somethin' Sezik can make a lot of that at least attempts to disguise how inedible the food is here...I got it! Mystery Meatloaf! 
Kill Cheng-Bo at Fire Camp Gai-Cho in Townlong Steppes.	Cheng Bo!	Cheng Bo is the Warbringer of Fire Camp Gai-Cho. While you've made a dent in their operations, you now have an opportunity to strike a major blow. Slay the Warbringer! 
Complete the Assault on Zeb'tula. Speak to Lor'themar Theron to begin the attack.	The Assault on Zeb'tula	Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, Mechanic. However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland. I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack. I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment. When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me. 
Earn Revered standing with the Golden Lotus.	Understanding The Shado-Pan	The Shado-Pan rank among Pandaria's oldest defenders. For years we train in our snow-capped monastery high in the Kun-Lai Summit, perfecting the martial secrets passed down by our ancestors. Our numbers may seem few, but a single Shado-Pan can be deadlier than a hundred trained soldiers. To join the Shado-Pan order is a long journey full of hardship. If this is the path you seek, then you must first prove your worth. There is urgent work to be done here. Help the Golden Lotus defend the Vale. 
Kill 9 Burilgi Despoilers at the Muskpaw Ranch.	Yakity Yak	For now, the yaungol invaders seem content to steal yaks. Surveying the area, however, you notice they could easily move on the Yak Wash at any moment. Thinning their numbers may help show the yaungol that this area is protected. 
Collect 12 Mogu Relics.	Profiting off of the Past	Let me guess, you're here to deal with the mogu statues that are being reanimated. What a coincidence, I'm here to, um... conduct research on the mogu. I tell you what, if you bring me as many of the mogu relics in there that you can carry, I'll give you a cut. Of the research... funding. 
Slay 10 Stonebound Destroyer the Woods of the Lost and discover their source.	The Sprites' Plight	<Living statues rampage through the woods. For now, they seem content in pummeling the forest sprites into splinters, but if they continue any further the pandaren will have more than just missing jade to worry about.> 
Defeat Minh Do-Tan.	Minh Do-Tan	Your next challenger is another relatively new trainee. His name is Minh Do-Tan, and he has won his last two matches. He will be waiting for you near the crane statue to the south. 
Defeat Huck Wheelbarrow.	Huck Wheelbarrow	Usually our trainees are adventurers like yourself, or monks from Tian Monastery, or occasionally retired Shado-Pan. Very rarely, though, we will greet trainees that have no fighting experience whatsoever. Huck Wheelbarrow is one such trainee. He has requested a duel with you. Look for him on the island's western shore. 
Infiltrate Stormsea Landing and open the courtyard gate from within. Speak with Taoshi to begin the mission.	A Bold Idea	Zandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from Zandalar to bolster Lei Shen's army. If we can capture the palace shipyard, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure. I have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army. 
Slay 15 Ik'thik Warriors or Ik'thik Infestors.	The Swarm Begins	Without the wall to protect us, we barely stand a chance. If you hadn't gathered so many people to help us, we wouldn't have a prayer. Check in with Captain Oakenshield - he should be up near the break in the wall. Kill as many mantid as you can on the way there. If we win, we win. If we lose, we go down fighting. For Pandaria! 
Kill 8 Coldbite Crocolisks.	Feeding the Beast	I must join the Klaxxi Council and the other paragons immediately, but I am barely strong enough to stand. I must feed, Wakener. I sense the beating hearts of creatures on the northern bank of the lake. Kill them for me, and I shall do the rest. 
Scare 8 Long-Haired Yaks or Steppebeasts.	Running Rampant	There is one thing that every army needs, and that is a supply line. The enemy camp to the west contains a large beast herd, which serves as the yaungol army's main source of food. Luckily for us, the yaks and mushan beasts of this region are easily scared. Sneak in, give the beasts a good slap, and watch the results. 
Unlock Drywood Cages to save 4 Longying Rangers and Lin Silentstrike.	Ranger Rescue	I must ask a most important task of you, George. Somewhere among the cages in the Osul camp is my husband, Lin. He is the light of my world. Please find him and return him to me, and save as many of our fellow Shado-Pan as you can as well. You should find keys to those cages on the Osul Marauders. 
Destroy 5 Ik'thik Whisperers and deactivate the Kypari Ik Beacon.	Damage Control	Kor'ik has been sending signals to the empress for weeks. Everything the Klaxxi have done, the empress knows about. That stops now! Kypari Ik will be the first to receive news of Kor'ik's demise. It would benefit us to make sure that message does not make it to the empress. Destroying the whisperers and beacon there will buy us enough time to come up with a plan before the empress can act. 
Kill Serevex with the aid of Lao-Chin the Iron Belly.	Lao-Chin and Serevex	Lao-Chin is facing off against the leader just above the entrance in the tree, on the north side of Sik'vess. He is to bring back the second crystal that we need to get into the mantid tunnel. Go there and lend him your aid. 
Slay 12 Mist Incarnations.	They Will Be Mist	The mist in this forest is a constant nuisance - one which I'm glad to hand off to trainees like you. Strange creatures lurk in the mist between these trees, and they must constantly be pushed back. Consider this part of your training. 
Listen to Gardener Fran's orders and water 60 of her vegetables. You can water plants while mounted.	Gardener Fran and the Watering Can	You want me to just GIVE you some hops? Pfshh! This is the third time today some little Human like you has come up to me asking for food! You want food? Then you'd better work!<She shoves a watering can into your hand.>Now go water my plants! 
Obtain the Dojani Orders.	Where are the Pools	Perhaps these mogu know where the pools are. Our scouts have reported seeing a commander along the southern side of the Ruins of Dojan. Kill him and take whatever information he is carrying. They should lead you to the pool. 
Speak with Lin Silentstrike at Winter's Blossom in Kun-Lai Summit.	To Winter's Blossom	The battle against the Sha is eternal - we can not leave this place. But I am troubled by the absence of reinforcements from the Monastery given that we sent for them days ago. You have performed admirably, perhaps you could travel to Winter's Blossom, our base camp on the way to the Shado-Pan Monastery. Speak with Lin Silentstrike once you arrive - he should know what is happening. To get there, travel north of the village and follow the road through Shado-Li Basin to Winter's Blossom. 
Obtain an Authentic Valley Stir Fry.	A Gift For Chee Chee	That crazy Chee Chee is actually pretty neat. Mah always said that hozen were nothing but trouble, but... I guess he's just a better hozen then the rest of them. We should do something nice for him! Those mountain hozen in the west make some really fancy stir fry, and keep bowls of it inside their little hozen houses. I bet Chee Chee would love some! 
Find 4 Playful Serpents.	The Rider's Bind	Have you seen the young serpents in the training yard? The littles ones tend to be mischievous, and some of them ran off to play before the training session. The Mistress will get angry if she discovers they're missing. Would you go find them and bring them back to me? I don't want them to get into trouble. They like to play out in the open, so look for them in courtyards and around the spires. 
Collect 6 Serpent Eggs.	Egg Collection	Ahhh, I should have known! You have the look of a hungry initiate. I would gladly help you choose a serpent egg, but the Slitherscale have thoroughly raided the cloud serpent nests. I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what to tell you. Unless you're crazy enough to sneak into the saurok camp to the east and retrieve some stolen cloud serpent eggs, I'm afraid I can't help you. 
Gather 6 Amber Blades from Shek'zeer Bladesworn around the Heart of Fear and The Clutches of Shek'zeer. Speak with Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver at Klaxxi'vess for a ride to the Heart of Fear.	Amber Arms	You! Filth! You work for me now! The amber blades of the Shek'zeer Bladesworn are the finest weapons in the empire. If you are not impaled upon them immediately after leaving here, bring me as many of the blades as you can carry! I want to make sure we have weapons in reserve, should we need them. 
Meet Sapmaster Vu at Rikkitun Village.	Sunset Kings	Olon had a clever idea. He thinks that we should visit the sprites to the west, and ask them if they have any of these ingredients. Some of the elements to this recipe are seeming... strange. The Rikkitun sprites have a village to the west of Kor'vess. I hope to see you there, George. 
Attempt to enlist the help of Mayor Honeydew in Honeydew Village.	You're Either With Us Or...	The assistance of the nearby village has now become a necessity, $p. We will need to use the village to regroup and tend to our wounded. Perhaps the villagers will join our cause after seeing the brutality unleashed by the alliance. You will act as envoy for the Horde. Ensure the cooperation of their leader. Do not disappoint me! 
Kill 10 Kor'thik Timberhusks with the aid of Lao-Chin's kegs.	Up In Flames	The mantid coming across the bridge have thick carapaces that shrug off most of our attacks. They have a weakness though: fire. Lao-Chen's men brought kegs to the battlefield for exactly this purpose. Kick the kegs into groups of mantid, and Lao-Chin's archers will light them up. They should be easy to finish off from there. 
Slay Lupello.	Lupello	I've been thinking... the wolves might stop attacking if we kill their pack leader. We call him Lupello, and he patrols the opposite riverbank.<Francis' concentration is broken by another attack. Perhaps you should go deal with Lupello yourself.> 
Kill Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter.	Among the Bones	My scouts have spotted a dangerous Zandalari among the bones west of Ihgaluk Crag. I need someone capable to see him dispatched. Are you up to the task? 
Recover Waterspeaker Gorai's Stolen Inkgill Ritual Staff from Orachi in Inkgill Mere.	The Waterspeaker's Staff	There is great dissent in Inkgill, Human. Elder Shai Hu drank the sha-corrupted waters of the mere, and forced the others to do the same. When I protested, Orachi of the town guard confiscated my ritual staff and banished me. Now, I am not only an exile, I am unable to speak with the waters that once gave me guidance! I am not a fighter. But if you are, perhaps you can recover my staff from Orachi? He is in town to our north. 
Find Ken-Ken.	Ken-Ken	So... Ken-Ken. The hozen. Personally, I'm impressed he's progressed so far in his training. He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind. He said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of the valley, I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at Zhu's Watch, in Krasarang Wilds, down the path to the south. See what he's found. 
Look for Yi-Mo Longbrow somewhere northeast of Zhu's Watch.	Finding Yi-Mo	My nephew, Yi-Mo, has always been sort of a downer. When this wave of despair hit the town, he took it harder than most. He sat around for days refusing to eat, just staring off into the horizon. Now he's wandered off toward the cliffs northeast of here, where the thunderbirds nest and hunt. Please, Mechanic, will you look for him? 
Kill Kaida the Bloodletter.	The Bloodletter	I have heard a disturbing report, Mechanic. Just beyond our position, in the Court of Bone, the mogu bring captives to a general named Kaida the Bloodletter. I will spare you the details, but he thrives on torturing his victims. This monster must be stopped. If you fall to his blade, I wish you a swift death. 
Kick 6 Vacant Destroyers in the Terrace of Ten Thunders.	Simulacrumble	<The shattered remains of an ancient mogu statue. This one looks like it never animated before it was broken. Whatever dark magic the mogu are employing here, it seems to make the brittle statues significantly tougher. Better to destroy them while they are still vacant. A good old-fashioned kick should do the job.> 
Kill 10 Shan'ze Gravekeepers, Shan'ze Soulrippers, or Shan'ze Thundercallers.	Grave Circumstances	The Court of Bones crawls with mogu forces. Endlessly do they perform their rituals of lightning and thunder. If our mission to take this island is to succeed, then we cannot allow them to hold such a strategic position. They must be eliminated. 
	A Ruby Shard for Old Hillpaw	 
Retrieve 6 Ritual Artifacts from around Conqueror's Terrace.	The More You Know	This whole area is littered with Zandalari artifacts. I would be lying if I said studying them didn't interest me. I am fascinated by the significance of these objects to their rituals. The more we understand our enemies, the better prepared we are to defeat them. If I am to study them, I will need to see them up close. Bring me as many artifacts as you can find. 
Kill Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter.	Raining Bones	We've spotted a Zandalari leader up the central stairs. We need to eliminate him before returning to camp. Would you be willing to do the deed? 
Activate the Sonar Tower, then defend Korven the Prime as he examines the tree.	Kypari Zar	What is that tree on the hill to the west? Can it be... Kypari Zar?<Korven the Prime lapses into silence.>When I returned from my final ravage, before being elevated to a paragon, I was given the honor of planting that very tree. I see it has grown into a great kypari, but... it seems something is amiss. There is an old sonar tower at the base of the tree. Take me there, Wakener. I can use the tower to take a closer look. 
Use Celestial Jade Chunks to defeat 6 Sha Remnants.	Jaded Heart	The more powerful remnants of that horrible manifestation may be too much for you to handle on your own, George. I fear I'd be of little help in terms of actual combat, but I can suggest a solution. The great jade statue was soon to become a living serpent - one of our revered celestials. Its construction imbued it with special powers that may sufficiently weaken these adversaries. 
Find something to help you carry the brew back to Chen in Mogujia.	Yak of All Trades	<The brew barrels are too heavy and numerous to carry alone. Perhaps you can find something, or someone, to help you.> 
Plant a Striped Melon in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	It's Melon Time	<Farmer Yoon looks up at the sky and sniffs the air.>Hmm...<He licks his paw and holds it up in the air, sticks a toenail into the soil, and then inspects the length of his shadow.>Yup. It's melon time. Could you grab some seeds and help me plant a Striped Melon? 
Use the Vision of Time in the Siege of Orgrimmar.	Hidden Threads	You have kept our mission a secret, and for that I thank you. Knowledge of the timeways, when in the wrong hands, can cause catastrophic devastation. My flight has little power to repair it, now. We must be careful. The hourglass grows in power. I believe it can now be used to see much further than before. I wish you to push it to its limits. Return to the Siege of Orgrimmar, and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find. 
Toss Orange-Colored Turnips in front of 12 Twitchheel Hoarders.	Crouching Carrot, Hidden Turnip	Uncle Chen's still got his eye on me, which means I won't be wandering off any time soon. I guess it's up to you to take these turnips... I mean, ""carrots""... into the Twisted Warren and deliver them for me. It should be pretty simple. Just toss the vegetables in front of virmen, then watch their reaction when they find out it's really a turnip! 
Taste the Aged Grain, Light Grain, Fresh Grain, and Malted Grain.	Taste Test	As long as you're here, you might as well help me out. I'm feeling pretty darn unqualified for the task, seeing as I've never drank a drop of beer in my life. You should try a little sample of each of their grains. Let's see if any of this stuff is sweet enough for Uncle Chen. 
Obtain Mulberry Leaves, feed 5 Hungry Silkworms, and get Raw Silk.	Where Silk Comes From	Would you like to be a Silkmaster for a day? The first thing you'll need are fresh mulberry leaves. You can find them in our grove of mulberry bushes to the northwest. Next you will need to feed them to a hungry silkworm in our feeding pit to the west. And finally you should get some raw silk from our processing hut on the south side of our farm. Have fun! 
Report to High Elder Cloudfall at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.	Flying Colors	You have passed every test we prepared for you, George. It is now time for you to move on to bigger and better things....but not before another banquet. The High Elder will be waiting for you at the banquet grounds to celebrate your graduation from our monastery. 
	A Dish for Ella	 
Collect a Sha-Touched Claw from the Korune Spellweaver.	The Source of Korune Power	Why hullo there! Have ya ever seen tha like o' these statues? Fascinatin'!I was scouting up along the ruins earlier, and I spotted somethin' innerestin' up on the highest rise. I couldn't get close enough, but I think it might be one o' these mogu statues, 'cept it was movin'!I can't get through all those nasty blood elves, but you look like you could. Would you mind going up there and bringing me back anything of interest? 
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane near the base of the Pedestal of Hope.	Ellia Ravenmane: Rematch	Ellia Ravenmane requested a rematch with you. She seems to identify you as her ""rival"". We discourage rivalries here within the Cradle of Chi-Ji, but we rarely decline a rematch request. You will find Ellia near the Pedestal of Hope, on the island's eastern side. 
Recover the Mallet Head.	The Head	Monkey King receive word on where to find the head,The hozen who got it has long since been dead. Kunzen chiefs pass the relic from father to son, But then virmen Skiggit came and the head it won. Now the wikket worships it in a hollow. Since it was too ookin' big for him to swallow. I sent a royal finder north to find him and stand. Look for finder in mountains west of the Heartland. 
Defeat Brewmaster Chani.	Round 1: Brewmaster Chani	Welcome, Challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes. Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round. Fight with strength, fight with honor. 
Complete the Assault on Shaol'mara. Speak to Jaina Proudmoore to begin the attack.	The Assault on Shaol'mara	Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, Mechanic. However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland. I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack. I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment. When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me. 
Harvest 100 drops of Shade by slaying sha creatures and wildlife near The Sunset Brewgarden.	Bound With Shade	About that scroll you found...I keep looking at that line in the second stanza - ""bound with wood and shade"". The ""shade"", in particular, intrigues me. I must admit, I've often considered taking some of the area's residual sha essence and incorporating it into a brew. I suspect that this is the shade which our recipe calls for. You will find large amalgamations of sha to the southeast of our tree... though you may also be able to harvest some from the local wildlife. 
Use the Tear of the Sin'dorei on Uda the Beast, High Arcanist Savor, Magister Hathorel, Magister Surdiel, and Magistrix Vesara.	The Remaining Sunreavers	There's still a number of significant Sunreavers who haven't been accounted for. Odds are that they're in the Sunreaver's Sanctuary, caught by surprise.<Rommath hands you an artifact, clearly made by blood elf hands.>The place is crawling with Silver Covenant. You'll need to get in, use the Tear to evacuate the VIPs, and then get out. Stay alive, George. 
Befriend Lorewalker Cho by assisting him around his house: Trim his tree, paint his wall, and feed his birds.	A Visit with Lorewalker Cho	Stranger, I may be able to help you find your prince. But first, I would like to know a little more about you and your people. Come, help me with my chores, and we will chat. You have the look of a grizzled war veteran, but certainly you have a few minutes to help a bookish Pandaren like myself putter around the house, yes? 
Use Cho's Fireworks near Admiral Taylor, Mishka and Sully.	Emergency Response	Your companions have made themselves at home in our land, and brought with them a dangerous conflict. The full extent of their destruction here we cannot yet know. Already it is... unspeakable. Nevertheless, to forsake your friends out of spite would be against our way. Any that yet live are doubtlessly wounded and in desperate need of care. These fireworks were to celebrate the statue's completion. Use them near your companions to signal Mishi, and she will bear them off to safety. 
Gather 10 Vor'thik Eggs from Kypari Vor.	Citizens of a New Empire	At Shek'zeer's command, the great kypari tree of Kypari Vor was twisted into a totem of horror. Like those outside of the palace, the clutch nearby is now used to corrupt our swarmborn. Recover the eggs of the Vor'thik before they are tainted. We shall raise them here. They will be the citizens of a new empire, free from the sha. 
Kill 8 Ashfang Hyenas.	Slaying the Scavengers	The rotting corpses are attracting hyena scavengers. In addition to spreading diseases from feeding on the dead, the feral creatures will attack us on sight. Go and eradicate the beasts. It is unfortunate, but ultimately for the best. 
Kill 3 Ik'thik Genemancers and 6 Ik'thik Egg-Drones.	Bad Genes	Far to the south, Wakener, the Empress's genemancers set about their dark experiments. (Dark yes, but not as dark as mine!)They dissect and mutate the nearby wildlife, breeding creatures of their own design. (Their design, which will become my design!)We must not let them succeed! (No, no! Only I am allowed such power!)Their mutations are already being unleashed for war. Go! Destroy them at any cost! 
Kill 12 Lion's Landing military units.	Kick 'em While They're Down	The Alliance may think they have a stranglehold on the ruins, given that their base of operations is close. We're going to disabuse them of that notion. Go take out some of their guards. 
Kill 8 Gormali Raiders and 8 Gormali Incinerators in Nectarbreeze Orchard.	Defiance	The damn mogu hit us out of nowhere! Anyone they don't kill on sight is being dragged away into the woods. This is the only safehouse, and its all I can do to hold the door. What do you say, friend? Are you willing to stand up and fight for the weak? 
Kill 12 Sik'thik mantid.	Thinning the Sik'thik	For all our efforts to keep the mantid in the Dread Wastes, some have broken through, seemingly intent on Niuzao Temple. My men have been attempting to extinguish their presence to the west, at Sik'vess, but to no success. If you're half of the Mechanic Taran paints you to be, maybe you will fare better. Head west, and kill any Sik'thik mantid you find. And remember, this is no time for mercy. There are lives at the temple depending on us. 
Set off the Monastery Fireworks in the Ring of Inner Focus, then survive the Rumpus for two minutes.	The Rumpus	Master Stone Fist has trained you in the art of one-on-one combat. Now you learn the art of one-on-many. How does fifty sound? Lower yourself into the Ring of Inner Focus below, then, when you're ready, set off this firework. My assistants will come at you, several at a time. All you need to do is survive. 
Find Kang Bramblestaff.	Kang Bramblestaff	Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths. His current path is as dangerous as any - he is headed deep into the Krasarang Wilds. I wouldn't normally ask a favor of a stranger, but... would you make sure that he is well? It would give me relief to know that a brave Human was looking out for him. 
Find the missing supply crate at Serenity Falls.	Missed Me By... That Much!	Listen, <pal/toots>. I sent out a coupla supply drones from the gunship, and they've all been lost or crashed. Almost all, that is. One of 'em buzzed right through the camp here and crashed out by them waterfalls. How 'bout you see what you can do about bringin' the contents of that crate back here, hmm? We're all outta drones, but my rocket boots might get come in handy... or footy, as the case may be. Hah! I just kill me... 
Gather 20 Imperial Lotus Leaves.	Lotus Tea	The mogu really like their poisons and curses. Mama Bramblestaff always said lotus tea cures any mogu curse. I saw some imperial lotus plants in the nearby Ruins of Dojan. We should go gather some of their leaves and keep them on hand just in case the mogu get unruly. Also, this will give me a chance to introduce my fists to some mogu faces. 
Speak to Pearlfin Aqualytes and arm them with the proper equipment.	A Perfect Match	Elder Lusshan and I agree that the best path forward will be to work together. We will share with the Pearlfin our superior military knowledge and weaponry. In return, they will be a powerful ally should we again encounter the Horde. Take this crate of equipment and weapons. I need you to go around the village and equip the jinyu with weapons befitting their skills. 
Bring 100 Sapfly Bits to Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver in the Terrace of Gurthan.	Wakening Sickness	You will forgive my current state. I have slept for many years. A Klaxxi'va should have been here to attend my Wakening with kypari sap... but you will have to do. I sense the buzzing of sapflies to the south. They gorge on the nourishing sap I need. Bring them to me. 
Speak to Taran Zhu in Bleak Hollow.	Allies in the Shadows	The Shado-Pan arrived here before we did, and they are already at work undermining the Thunder King's forces. I want you to meet with Taran Zhu, the leader of the Shado-Pan, and offer your services on behalf of the Sunreavers. I doubt he is truly in need of the aid, but the gesture holds importance in itself. 
Slap Rikkilea Flitterlings, then catch 88 flecks of Flitterling Dust.	Fiery Wings	I think that old paper said something about ""fiery wings."" Those little dragons around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way. You're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them. No point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings. 
Plant a Scallion in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	Why Not Scallions?	I heard Haohan mentioning that he was going to plant scallions today. I'm not sure if today's the best day for scallions, but I'd like to hope that he knows what he's doing. He is the head of the Tillers' union, after all. Could you plant a scallion for me? 
Purchase a Time-Worn Journal from Mistweaver Ai.	Hints From The Past	There is much to learn of this place, yet it does not yield its secrets willingly. Something you mentioned the last time that we spoke intrigues me. This Mistweaver Ai, she carries a time-worn journal, if I recall? This may be the answer to many of our questions, or it may simply raise more. I suppose that it all depends on the diligence of the explorer that put pen to paper in this preposterous place. Obtain a time-worn journal and return to me with it. We shall delve into its mysteries together. 
Kill 10 Spiteful Spirits.	Spiteful Spirits	The spirits of the fallen villagers have risen! I can feel the hatred emanating from the spirits. George, if we are to survive here, we must defend ourselves. This is the only way we can put them to rest. 
Obtain 10 Snarlvines.	Golgoss Hungers	Golgoss' strength is great, but he requires nutrition before he can use it. The snarlthorn bushes in the Upper Sumprushes have heavy, fibrous branches. These should sate his appetite. 
Speak to Big Bao, then defeat him.	The Trainer's Challenge: Big Bao	Are you ready for another lesson, George? Today, you will spar against Big Bao. He is large of stature and of heart, and he will not give up until he is wholly beaten. If you wish to defeat him, you will need to persevere. Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck. 
Harvest 8 Ripe Scallion plants and provide 40 Scallions for the Sunreaver Onslaught.	Work Order: Sunreaver Onslaught II	Once your scallions are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up. Just think; your scallions will feed so many hungry soldiers on the front lines! 
Recover 16 Volatile Dread Orbs from the Ambermarsh.	Improvised Ammunition	I've got another job for you. The dragon cannons we depend on to keep the thicker swathes of mantid back are running low on ammo. The camp's cannoneers developed an improvised explosive that's made from the globe seeds down the western ridge. They dispatched a couple initiates to bring some back hours ago, but have heard nothing from them. I want to send someone a bit more capable to make sure that this gets taken care of. Are you my <man/woman> for this? 
Bring Between a Saurok and a Hard Place to Lorewalker Cho.	Between a Saurok and a Hard Place	Dear $p,We have received your research on the saurok and believe we have pieced together clues about their past. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Use the Sap Jar at Imperial Feeders outside the Heart of Fear 4 times to fill it.	Sampling the Empire's Finest	The wonders of the kypari sap never cease to amaze me. Among its numerous properties and applications, the sap can be refined into a nutritious and extremely delectable elixir. Nowhere in the Empire will you find a finer execution of this brew than the palace itself. Surely, the homes of the loyalists have feeders brimming with this sweet nectar. Fill this jar at their feeders and return it to me. I long to sample the imperial ambrosia once more. 
Kill any 10 members of the Reliquary in the Ruins of Ogudei.	Eviction Notice	The bloody Reliquary's snuck into the ruins. They've taken the lower section and are conducting all kinds of magical shenanigans down there. It's time we gave 'em an eviction notice, in the form of your boot in their rear! 
Bring The Zandalari Prophecy to Lorewalker Cho.	The Zandalari Prophecy	Dear $p,I have read your reports on the Zandalari and believe I have some clues as to their most recent aggression. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Move 6 Plump Marmots off of Thunderfoot Farm, and fill in 6 Marmot Holes.	Rampaging Rodents	I went off this morning to watch my papa fight the virmen. When I came back, the farm was full of marmots! I don't want to kill them, but we need to get rid of them. Hey, I know! We can close the holes! Fill in their holes with dirt, so they can't come out in our farm anymore. 
	FLAG - Fragment of Dread	 
Speak with Taran Zhu in Townlong Steppes.	Hero's Call: Townlong Steppes!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Taran Zhu in Townlong Steppes. The Shado-Pan want to reclaim their land from the clutches of the yaungol, but lack the numbers to do so. Assist them with their assault against the yaungol. Glory to the Alliance! 
Search the Krasari Ruins for Chezin Dawnchaser.	Search Party	I sent a diplomat to look for allies in the ruins east of here. My diplomat has not returned and now Kang tells me this jungle is filled with a sinister people known as the mogu. Chezin is my friend and Leza's brother. To lose a brother would cause her to give in to despair. She already has enough to worry about with her fever. Could you investigate the ruins east of here and find out what happened? 
Free 8 Pandaren Prisoners.	Pandaren Prisoners	Look, I know the Horde needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town. But I know that the yaungol over at Fire Camp Ordo, to the west, have taken many of my people as prisoners. And I also know that if you would be willing to rescue them from their captivity, they'd more than likely be willing to join the Horde. What do you say, George? 
Kill Chief Gukgut.	Carp Diem	Despite the hozen's apparent disarray, there is an order to their chaos. Their leader, Chief Gukgut, is the shrewd mastermind behind their attacks. He is organizing their movements at the great pit at the hozen camp to the northwest. Strike now and show him no mercy, George, for he will do the same. 
Board your raft, then report to Wise Ana Wu in the middle of Nayeli Lagoon.	The Lorewalker on the Lake	Your raft is down in the water below. Take it out to the middle of the lake, where you should find a woman. Her name is Ana Wu. Whenever I have a question that I can't figure out on my own, I'll ask her. She should be able to tell us why these crocolisks won't stop attacking. 
Kill the Maw of Despair in both the eastern and western pagodas at the Temple of the Red Crane.	Ahead on the Way	Huge maws of despair are spewing out sha from the pagodas on either side of the temple. Meanwhile, your impromptu training in the Way continues.""She who mends torn umbrella will be more dry than she who strikes at rain.""While I take issue with that particular lesson--sometimes punching the rain can be quite effective--the meaning holds true in this case. Take out those maws of despair and give my order a chance at reclaiming the temple grounds. 
Listen to Xiao and his companions.	FLAG - Player Began Finale	Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs. I'm just a visitor... like you. Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards. 
Speak with Vereesa Windrunner to travel to Lion's Landing, then speak with King Varian Wrynn.	What Had To Be Done	Thank you for your aid today, George. I will be handling the purge from here on out. Jaina will soon be off to Lion's Landing, to speak with King Varian. She asked for your attendance. 
	Great Turtle Meat	 
Plant Witchberries in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	Which Berries? Witchberries.	That young'un over there, Andi, is going to grow up to be a heck of a farmer some day. I can tell just by lookin' at him. I think I'll plant him some witchberries. Kids love witchberries - it'll be a nice surprise. 
Use the Klaxxi Tuning Fork on the Ocean-Worn Rocks to awaken the paragon.	By the Sea, Nevermore	The Klaxxi'va have spoken to me, outsider. The paragon is hidden in the Briny Muck only, he is not so hidden anymore. The lizard men surround him. He cannot fall into their scaly hands. You will find him; you will awaken him. Do not return without him! If you do this the Klaxxi will be pleased with us. 
	Weighted Mogu Artifact	 
Obtain 4 Mushan Shoulder Steaks and 80 Turtle Meat Scraps.	The Meat They'll Eat	I told you earlier, my pigs are picky eaters. They need to eat meat to grow strong, but they don't like mutton, they don't like yak, and I'm not about to feed them any pig meat. They do, however, eat meat off of the mushan beasts, and they're also quite partial to turtle. Both creatures can be found in abundance to the west. My skills as a hunter are admittedly quite weak. Can you help out a young rancher and his pigs? 
Recover 6 Stolen Sacks of Hops from the Twisted Warren.	Thieves to the Core	You and that Chen fellow are good people, helpin' out with the virmen like you are. I don't like to ask for favors, but I ain't gonna turn 'em away, either. While you're out there puttin' the hurt to those rabbit-men, you wouldn't mind keepin' an eye out for some bags o' hops, would ya? I'm pretty sure they lifted 'em last night. Probably usin' em for pillows, knowin' how they are. 
Challenge Chao the Voice, and then defeat her in combat at Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes.	The Challenger's Ring: Chao the Voice	It looks like you're quite the fighter, $p. Chao heard about it, and she's been talking about how she'd kick your...Well, let's just say I think you should challenge her and try to get her respect. 
Destroy Guardian Tak'u in Conqueror's Terrace.	What's Inside Counts	I noticed something strange on my last scouting mission. A group of Zandalari are performing a ritual on what appears to be a very large sentry. They may be trying to re-animate it. We need that ritual stopped and the sentry destroyed. Anything that large can't be good. I've sent a scout ahead to observe their actions. Meet with her and figure out how to stop them. 
Kill 14 Hozen at the Wreck of the Vanguard.	Hozen Aren't Your Friends, Hozen Are Your Enemies	We've located an Alliance wreck to the south. Unfortunately, the locals have informed us that it's currently being scavenged by a group of creatures called ""hozen.""By pillaging our wrecked ships, these creatures have already shown that they aren't friendly. We can't have them taking spoils from our ships, stealing our supplies, and worse, potentially capturing or killing any survivors. Get down there and take them out! When you're done, meet up with Nodd Codejack, our SI:7 agent in the area. 
Defeat Leechfingers.	Educating Saurok	The Spring Road is under the protection of her ladyship, the esteemed Madam Goya. The saurok of Hatescale Burrow northeast of here require ""education"" in this fact. We have warned them before but sadly they seem to have a very short memory. Travel northeast to this burrow and find their shaman leader. Eliminate him and you will have the gratitude of her ladyship. As well as an appropriate bounty. 
Light the Memorial Flame of Zhu, Memorial Flame of Rin, and Memorial Flame of Po along the southwest border of Zhu Province.	Borderlands	Bonfires are surprisingly effective at discouraging beasts from wandering out of the wilds. We have three along the border to the southwest which we normally keep lit at all times. Nobody's been there for days, though, and the fires must be out by now. It's only a matter of time before the wilds creep back in and overtake the land we have kept safe for centuries. Please, re-ignite the bonfires. They are critical in keeping the province safe, and they are memorials to the founders of our way of life. 
Recover 15 Chunks of Jade from Puckish Sprites around the Greenstone Mason's Quarter.	I Have No Jade And I Must Scream	Our whole jade supply line has fallen apart. The mines are a death trap, morale is historically low, and - as if that weren't bad enough - the mason's quarter has been overrun by wood sprites! Now even the plants are out to ruin me! You need jade so badly, you can follow the road southwest to the mason's quarter and get it from those glorified chopsticks yourself. 
Defeat Fat Long-Fat at the top of Angkhal Pavilion.	Fat Long-Fat	You have been matched with a... special trainee. His name is Fat Long-Fat.<Thelonius chooses his words carefully.>Fat Long-Fat... operates outside of the normal rules of combat. He does not fight every day, and when he does, he chooses his competitor. Today, for some reason... he has selected you. You will find him atop Angkhal Pavilion. 
Kill 6 Garrosh'ar Grunts and 6 Garrosh'ar Gear-Greasers.	No Plan Survives Contact with the Enemy	Quickly and quietly; that's how SI:7 prefers to operate. That was the plan, at least. Rell Nightwind is already inside Garrosh'ar Point looking for signs of Anduin and Taylor, but it's getting hot in there and he needs support. Fight yer way through these dogs and find Rell! 
Bring Captain Jack's head to Chief Kah Kah at Grookin Hill.	Captain Jack's Dead	Gore from Captain Jack's head drips and mysteriously seeps into the ground as you examine your hard-won trophy. Strange, but no time to investigate that now. There's too much work to be done. The chieftain of your newfound friends will doubtlessly be impressed with this proof of your grookin' skills. 
Bait 10 Empty Crab Pots in Lonesome Cove. Each pot requires 2 Sea Monarch Chunks.	Fresh Pots	We got a load of empty crab pots out there that need fresh bait. Now, we COULD pull them one at a time and bait them up here in comfort. A nice chair to sit on, maybe a hot cup of tea to keep you warm. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Never gonna happen. Head to Lonesome Cove, immediately southwest, and bait those pots with two chunks of fresh sea monarch. By ""fresh"" I mean killed right there in the water. Oh, and by ""pots"" I mean traps. If you wanna be part of the crew, you'd better learn the lingo. 
Kill 8 Osul Marauders or Osul Spitfires.	Seeing Red	Ahead of us is the main thrust of the yaungol army. Here, they prepare their vast army to attack the villages of Kun-Lai. If we strike at the Osul now, we can cut them at their very core. Remember, for every of their number that we strike down here, we save one of our own back at home. 
Plant the Shado-Pan Banner on the Ceremonial Pile, then kill Jung Duk.	Jung Duk	THIS. IS. WAR. I will have the heads of everyone who took Lin from me. EVERYONE! We will begin with the Osul leader, Jung Duk. Take this Shado-Pan war banner and place it at the center of their camp. Jung Duk will have no choice but to face you. Show him no mercy, George. 
Summon Golgoss by planting the Mist-Shaman's Torches into the Peat Clump in the Upper Sumprushes.	Golgoss	The leader of the yaungol mist-shaman is named Jahesh. He is known for his strength. One of my kind is also known for his strength. His name is Golgoss. Golgoss sleeps within the mists of the Upper Sumprushes. Help me to summon him, and he will join me in avenging our people. 
Obtain 8 Gushing Mists by walking through mist geysers in the Upper Sumprushes.	Orbiss Fades	I knew death would come. I did not know that it would come this fast. I must buy time. The mist of the Upper Sumprushes is warm and fragrant. Such mist is nutritive to my kind. Gather this mist however you can... in jars, in vials, within the interior of your bags. Bring it back to me, and I can use it to remain corporeal for a bit longer. 
Speak with Ogo the Younger at Niuzao Temple in the Townlong Steppes.	The Wisdom of Niuzao	Niuzao, the Black Ox, rests in the temple to the west. He may know why the mantid are attacking. He may, in fact, know much more than that. I will rendezvous with you at Niuzao Temple, Mechanic. 
Collect 3 Artifacts of the Black Empire from Black Empire Caches in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Corrupted Curiosities	I understand that the Black Empire poses a grave threat to Pandaria, but we may also use this as an opportunity! Though we've faced them several times before, very little is known about the Old Gods or N'Zoth's mysterious realm of Ny'alotha. When studying ancient civilizations, we often rely on artifacts to unlock the deepest mysteries lost to time. I wonder if some such artifacts could be found among the Old God's forces? It can't hurt to check, right? 
Slay 10 Greenwood Tricksters in the Waxwood Forest.	And a Heavy Fist	The greenwood sprites in the Waxwood Forest to the west pose no direct threat to us, this is true. However, their numbers have increased as of late, as have their wily antics. Part of our duty as wardens of this forest is to maintain the balance. Your duty is to do so by returning these sprites to the earth. 
Destroy 6 Zandalari Offerings.	Dark Offerings	The Zandalari's spiritbinders perform dark sacrifices to appease their gods, killing our people in the process. Destroy any Zandalari offerings you can find in Za'Tual to help slow the pace of their dark sacrifices. 
Observe Vaeldrin as he tests the water of youth.	Immortality?	Something is... off. The water feels strange. When we arrived here I felt the presence of the Light, strong and vibrant, far to the north. I thought it would be the Pools of Youth. But this... this water is tainted somehow. Stained with mogu magics. I think it best I try only a sip and we see what happens. 
Kill 5 Spirit-Bound Sentries and then use the Resonance Crystal to capture the Zandalari spirits trapped within.	Centuries in Sentries	Sacrifices are common place in Zandalari society. There is however one oddity among these barbaric rituals; volunteers. They treat it as a great honor! The weak still seek to contribute, even if that means giving their lives to be bound to the sentries you see walking around. Locked away in service to their people. Take this resonating crystal. Once destroyed, drain the sentry of its Zandalari inhabitant. Return the crystal to me when your task is complete. 
Defeat The Wrestler.	Round 3: The Wrestler	Your next challenger is a favorite of mine. He draws strength from raw force and determination. Plus he has a mask. Face him in the western arena when you are ready, and good luck. 
Defeat 10 Amani Beserkers, 5 Amani Behemoths, and 3 Gurubashi Bloodriders.	Enemies At Our Door	The Zandalari have begun their attack! You must help defend the village! If we can't push them back, we will never find the Thunder King's remains! 
Plant a Jade Squash in Sunsong Ranch. You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market.	Squash Those Foul Odors	Grandpa always said, ""A squash a week, and your tail won't reek.""<Yoon subtly sniffs the air.>Yup. I think it's been about a week. Could you help me plant a Jade Squash? 
Use the Arcane Bauble to find an anomaly within the Ruins of Ogudei.	It Is A Mystery	We have detected several... anomalies in these mines, of an arcane or spiritual nature. They are disrupting our attempts to discern the nature of the magic used in the spirit binding rituals here. They are quite elusive, but we've managed to isolate the arcane signature of one of these anomalies, and one of our mages has enchanted this bauble with its signature. Take the bauble. It will begin to glow more brightly as you approach the anomaly. Once you reach it, you can use the bauble to draw it out. 
Locate the unearthed paragon in the Amber Quarry on Zan'vess.	The Zan'thik Dig	We have just intercepted a message from an adjunct on Zan'vess. Yaungol laborers there have unearthed a paragon in the amber quarry on the back side of the island. Get there immediately and free him before the Zan'thik destroy him! 
Challenge Snow Blossom and defeat her in the Challenger's Ring.	The Challenger's Ring: Snow Blossom	News of your feats has been traveling around the camp, George. In fact, Snow Blossom would like to test your skill in battle. You had best prepare yourself, Mechanic. She is not easily defeated. If you can prove your worth to her, you will win a valuable friend. 
	Void Conduit	 
Bring Krosh's Back to Yan in New Cifera.	Guess Whose Back	<This dragon turtle's massive shell is rock-hard and covered in sharp ridges. One of the locals could almost certainly make use of it.> 
	Unlocked Yalia Sagewhisper	 
Report to Loon Mai at Stoneplow in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Training and Discipline	I told myself that, if I ever made it here to the Hidden Master, I would learn everything I could from him. This is my chance, George. I'm not going to let it slip away. Still, I fear that Stoneplow needs us. I left early, before we were able to push the mantid scouts back. I'd feel better if you would check in with the Watch Commander for me. Oh, and if you run into the others, maybe you should tell them where the Hidden Master is... 
Find Admiral Taylor.	The Missing Admiral	Alright. According to the clues you found, that was Anduin's ship, and Admiral Taylor was the captain. And Admiral Taylor's last entry says he was going to fight off the hozen and protect the vessel after the shipwreck. The locals say these hozen sometimes take prisoners, and I didn't see Taylor's corpse anywhere among the wreckage. So you'll probably find Taylor at the hozen encampment to the northeast. Get going, we have no time to lose! 
	A Marsh Lily for Gina	 
Gather 5 Mogu Poisoned Blades.	Poisoned!	The... mogu. Do not trust. Poison. Get sample... sample blades. Bring to Dezco... in Thunder Cleft, west of here. 
Kill Mist Creepers until a Mist Horror appears, then collect a Mist Horror Heart.	Potency	To make the Dream Brew, we will need several ingredients. First, to improve its strength, I will need an ingredient from a fearsome creature, the legendary Mist Horror. It is said that this creature only appears where the fog is deepest. North and east of here, you will find smaller Mist Creepers roaming the swamps. Kill these creatures until the Mist Horror appears, and then bring me its heart. 
Kill 10 Ik'thik Mantid.	The Mantid	The mantid! They came out of nowhere and smashed our convoy to ruin, scattering our people this way and that. Now they are preparing to hit Stoneplow. Please, Mechanic, destroy some of these beasts before they get sufficient numbers to flank our home. If my cousin, Ambassador Len, is still alive and at our convoy he should be able to reward you for your help. 
Find Scout Captain Daelin at the Beast Pens.	The Beast Pens	I do not want to see another Zandalari beast rider breach our defenses! I have dispatched Scout Captain Daelin and some war mages to the Beast Pens northwest of here. Their mission is to infiltrate and harass the Zandalari siege and cavalry units. I want you to join them and lend your expertise. Keep an eye out for the tell tale shimmer of their magical cloaking spell. 
Use the Tongue of Ba-Shon in the Valley of Emperors.	Staying Connected	The Tongue of Ba-Shon should allow us to communicate from long distances, George. If the relic works the way I think it will, I should be able to stay here and continue my meditations while you do some scouting in the Valley of Emperors. Mishi will take you to the edge of the valley so that we can test my theory. I would hate for you to be in the tombs with no way to contact me. That would be horrible! 
Relieve the Exhausted Defenders from their guard posts.	It Takes A Village	The villagers have been guarding Zouchin since the first attack. They are exhausted and many are injured. If the Zandalari attack again the last thing we need is for the defenders to fall asleep on the job. Relieve them of their posts so that they might have time to heal and see their families. You'll find them stationed around the village. 
Pick up a keg near Lao-Chin, roll it downhill at the yaungol, and ignite it near them to destroy 4 Osul Treelaunchers and 50 Osul Invaders.	Do a Barrel Roll!	When I trained as a Brewmaster, I didn't expect to use my knowledge like this...Did you know beer catches fire when lit? Well, with yaungol oil mixed in, it's downright explosive. I've mixed the oil in with these kegs. Roll them at the yaungol over by the gate, and ignite them when you get close. It'll take a few seconds for the keg to blow, but when it does...Well, let's just say I wouldn't want to be over there. Which is why I'll be over here. Mourning the loss of this brew. 
Report to Loon Mai at Stoneplow in the Valley of the Four Winds.	Retreat!	I'm going to withdraw what few forces I have. We may have to fall back to the Stormstout Brewery, or even Halfhill. That call is Commander Loon Mai's to make. You go ahead. Deliver word to the Commander. My Shado-Pan will be shortly behind. 
Ask the inhabitants of The Sunset Brewgarden if they've seen any Stormstouts.	Fate of the Stormstouts	$p! It is so great to see you healthy, and traveling so far. It would seem that our paths are quite tightly intertwined. I'm here looking for my family. I am told that several Stormstouts came across the wall to help face the mantid threat. I mean to find them, and join them. Have you seen anyone named Stormstout come through here? Would you mind helping me ask around? 
	FLAG - Jade Infused Blade	 
Detonate the explosive cargo of The Defiant and Valor's Edge.	Another One Bites the Dust	The Alliance have planted themselves off our southern coast and continue to pepper our ground forces with cannon fire. Let us see how great their siege is without such support. Board the enemy vessels and destroy their reserve ammunition. This will take the teeth out of their bite. 
Kill 12 Krik'thik Deep-scouts with Taoshi's help.	Unwelcome Intruders	Those are mantid scouts down there. Gao-Ran's Battlefront is meant to keep them out of eastern Townlong Steppes. If we allow them north of the barricade, we may lose our foothold here. Let's clear them out. I'll be with you. 
Bring What is Worth Fighting For to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge.	What is Worth Fighting For	Dear $p,You have recovered the story of our people's freedom from the mogu empire. If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection. Thank you for your diligence! Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho 
Rescue the three captured Sunreaver agents within the Ghost Iron Mines, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.	Save Our Scouts!	The heavy mogu presence in the mines let us know it was a place of great importance - but we needed to gather more information on their activities there, so we sent agents into the mines to spy on them. Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through...And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, $p! 
Kill 8 Tricky Maizers.	Wee Little Shenanigans	So... we bought some cheap grains in bulk. It turned out the grain was infested with sprites. I HATE sprites. With their wee beady eyes and constant smiling. I would like to resolve this quietly. Can I buy your services to discreetly eliminate some of these grain thieves? 
	FLAG - Abandoned Crate of Goods	 
Free 5 hozen from the Engorged Crocolisks, and gather 5 Speckled Trout from Lake Kittitata.	Swallowed Whole	Now, back to your dilemma. I believe you can help your people build relations with our hozen, as my people have. The trail behind me will lead you to a body of water the hozen use to gather the fish that feeds them. Around this time every year, fearsome beasts call those waters home and many hungry hozen are lost to them. If you were to rescue some of the victims and gather some fish, perhaps you will be regarded more favorably. 
Kill 18 Haunts of Despair at the Temple of the Red Crane.	Striking the Rain	Now as for that ""striking the rain"" part... well, sometimes you have to.""Hope is the sun behind a stormy sky - ever in the heart, but veiled to the eye.""There seems to be no end to the sha pouring out of the temple. But in order to see beyond the veil of despair, you must carve through it. With any luck, you'll find a sun behind the clouds... 
	A Dish for Tina	 
Collect 30 Bug Legs from Tigerflies in Tigers' Wood.	The Bees' Knees	You really hozen friend, wikket? Let's see, hmm? Hozen at Grookin' Hill all outta slicky bait. Tigerflies' legs stay twitchy in water - make best bait! Bo Bo sick from stings. Wikket get bait and take to Grookin. 
Steal the Workshop Orders and slay the new captain of the Zandalari warship.	Extended Shore Leave	The Zandalari have already begun repairing that warship, but we can keep it crippled with minimal effort. Simply relieve the new captain of his post, and steal the ship's damage report from that workshop just outside the vault. No captain. No repairs. No warship. 
Defeat Julia Bates.	Julia Bates	We welcome all kinds here within the Cradle, as long as they recognize and subscribe to the ideologies of the Red Crane. One of our new, more exotic trainees comes from the human kingdoms to the northeast. She goes by the rather foreign-sounding name of Julia Bates. She is your next challenger. You will find her on the island's western shore. 
Free 5 Kirin Tor Captives near Dawnseeker Promontory.	Captive Audience	The Sunreavers will stoop to even the lowest levels to get what they want, George. I received reports earlier that several Kirin Tor have gone missing. I suspect the Sunreavers may have something to do with this. Hopefully they have not been harmed, or my wrath will be swift and terrible. I trust you to bring them back in one piece, but please hurry. 
Motivate 10 Lazy Hozen.	Sufficient Motivation	Training these savages has been quite a task, George. Finding ways to motivate them was easy enough; the problem is keeping them motivated.. and focused... and awake. Now that you're back, you can help me in getting the less disciplined Hozen moving, if you catch my drift. I'll leave the method up to you. 
Collect 5 Emergency Supplies from the Water Sprites.	They're So Thorny!	The crate, once full of desperately needed supplies, has been thoroughly pillaged. A quick scan of the area shows evidence left behind by the thieves. Icy thorns, just like the ones on the water sprites on the shoreline to the east. This is a life or death situation for your band of survivors. Those supplies need to be retrieved from these thieving pests and returned to camp. 
Kill 12 Springtail vermin.	Mission: Culling The Vermin	I was sent to this valley to protect The Heartland from any potential threats. I've identified a high priority target. The Springtail vermin burrow into the mountain cliffs, high above the farmlands. Left unchecked, their numbers will multiply, and they will make their way down to the fields below. They must be eliminated. 
Kill the Mistblade Scale-Lord.	The Scale-Lord	The saurok at the Lake of Stars take their orders from their Scale-Lord, a vicious, merciless leader who guards his territory fiercely. If we can eliminate this leader, then we can gain access to the enormous amber lode beneath the lake. Go. Their leader gives his orders from his underground dwelling, at the southern edge of the lake. 
Use the Bilgewater Molotovs to destroy 6 Skyfire Gyrocopter X2s.	Flash! Aaaaaahhhh!	The gnomes have brought their flying contraptions. I want my skies CLEAR! Get up there on whatever mount you have with you and destroy those paltry devices. You may use this grog I ""acquired"" from our goblin allies. It would be better served blasting down gyrocopters than in the gullet of those little green fiends. 
Kill 12 grounded Kor'thik Fleetwings.	Grounded Welcome	All of my men are down at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest, holding off mantid that are trying to fly across the chasm. As long as my marksmen have arrows, they'll ground any mantid that clear the chasm. If you're here to help, I could use some more men clearing the mantid out once they're on the ground. Are you willing, Mechanic? 
Interact with the three lightning drills in the Ghost Iron Mines to destroy them, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.	Maximum Capacitor	The mines north of here are being used to extract Ghost Iron ore and energize it with lightning energy. We need to destroy the drills they use to extract the ore. They are impervious to normal attack, but can be overloaded using the proper methods. Oh - and while you're there, take out whoever is running the operation. 
Destroy 3 Kirin Tor Constructs around Violet Rise.	Desconstruction	The Kirin Tor constructs are primitive at best. Nevertheless, they pose a threat. Go to Violet Rise and dismantle Jaina's pitiful war machines. Show the Kirin Tor how easily they can be defeated! This will be a message the Kirin Tor cannot easily ignore. 
	A Ruby Shard for Farmer Fung	 
	A Jade Cat for Fish	 
	A Ruby Shard for Tina	 
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane at Dome Balrissa.	Ellia Ravenmane: Revenge	Your ""rival"" has appeared again. Ellia Ravenmane has been avoiding her duties on the island, instead focusing on personal training, with the intent to defeat you in battle.""I will destroy George,"" she said. I have honored her request for a rematch, but I will be keeping a close eye on her. Her motives may be shifting in a dangerous direction. 
Find the Commander's Cache and collect your reward.	The Gratitude of Stoneplow	One last thing, George. Don't worry, it's not another favor. You've killed enough mantid today. We recently received a shipment of high-quality armor from Kun-Lai Summit. I was planning to keep them for my men... but I can't think of anybody more deserving than you. You'll find them on the second floor of the inn, here in town. 
Deliver the jade to Historian Dinh, Surveyor Sawa, Kitemaster Shoku, and Taskmaster Emi.	Love's Labor	Can I trouble you for another favor? We're way behind schedule, and this jade shipment is the last we need to finish the great statue. I've got my hands full, so could you run this ore over to the other foremen? Historian Dinh, Surveyor Sawa, and Kitemaster Shoku can all be found around the base of the statue. Taskmaster Emi is directing production at the top of the statue. We're on a deadline, so make sure you do it fast! Time's a wasting! 
Kill 10 Wilderland Stags.	Stag Mastery	I always was a fan of a good stag hunt. Stags are tough, fast, and territorial. They may be plant eaters but they can give any hunter a run for his money. East of here is a whole mess of Wilderland Stags just waiting for a hunter like yourself to give 'em a good run. Happy hunting. 
Plant 8 Striped Melon Seeds on Sunsong Ranch.	Work Order: The August Celestials I	<Yoon's familiar writing scrolls across the tattered paper.>The trainees out at the Cradle of Chi-Ji are in need of striped melons. Apparently, they use them in their training exercises. A representative will be by tomorrow to collect whatever striped melons you can spare. 
Kill 6 infected wildlife. Infected wildlife may include Bonedust Moths, Bluehide Mushan, and Mutating Scorpid.	Infection	The Empress's genemancers play with dangerous toys. To the south, they are injecting local wildlife with pheromone-laden parasites, in an attempt to create monstrous mutations for war. Carelessly, they have allowed their parasitic worms to escape into the local ecosystem. Left unchecked, the infection will spread from one animal to another, until we have an outbreak. I will inject you with a mild toxin. With it, you will be able to identify infected creatures. Kill the carriers at once. 
Ride with Taran Zhu and Taoshi to Dusklight Hollow.	Along the Southern Front	I'm heading westward with Taoshi to gather the strongest I can find to confront the Sha of Hatred. I would like you to come with me. 
Obtain 20 Pandaren Archaeology Fragments.	Research Project: The Pandaren Empire	Ah, adventurer. You come at a most opportune time. My daughter and I are researching the history of our people and have hit a roadblock in our research. Should you come across fragments of the pandaren past, please, bring them to us here. We would benefit greatly from the additional information. 
Ride with Taran Zhu, Taoshi, and Lao-Chin to Rensai's Watchpost.	Joining the Hunt	We are one stronger. Your help is invaluable. Let's move on westward to Rensai's Watchpost to find the last member for our party. 
Stop the source of the corruption within the Morrowchamber.	Rotten at the Roots	Underneath Kypari Kor is a large chamber where the mantid tend to the tree. That must be where the source of the corruption lies. We need to get into that chamber and stop them. N'Zoth must not be allowed to empower the swarm. 
Collect 1000 Ancient Arcane Powder.	Through the Portal	Ah, just the Mechanic I wanted to see! We've finally figured out why the portal is not working. We need more arcane powder! It would take us months to get a shipment sent out to us, but luckily, the mogu on this island carry plenty for their own spells. They tend to use some older stuff, so we're going to need a lot of it. 
Stop the Shan'ze Thundercallers' ritual.	The Call of Thunder	Within the graveyard, in the deepest ruins of their western crypt, the Thunder King's most powerful sorcerers are charging a lightning rod with crackling electricity. We suspect that this weapon is meant to rain destruction on our stronghold at Dawnseeker Promontory. There is no time to delay. You must stop their ritual at once. 
Defeat a Loa Speaker.	Loa-saur	The Zandalari have found a way to bind loa to their beasts giving them impressive and lethal powers. We need to put a stop to this. Search the Beast Pens for a loa speaker and slay him. You should be able to find them by keeping a look out for their glowing beasts. We must not allow these atrocities to continue. 
	Tracking Event: 6th Place	 
Obtain 18 Glade Glimmers and 5 Spindly Bloodfeathers.	Watery Woes	I love fishing. I'd be enjoying myself much more, however, if I had my bait and my lures. They were thrown away in a... a misunderstanding with my wife, Rin.<Gladecaster Lang sighs.>Should I let a whole day of fishing be ruined, just because of a little domestic squabble? No! All I need is bugs and feathers, after all, and this glade is filled with those two things. Care to help a fisherman out? 
Kill the Darnassian Outrider.	Blind Them!	These sunwalkers are a tiresome lot. I need soldiers with horde blood in their veins and honor in their hearts. Not some pacifist sun spirit filth. The Alliance are here, $p. Followed us no doubt, or somehow tracked the same visions Leza had that led us here. It doesn't matter. I don't want them to know how divided we are at the moment. Go kill their scout south of here before it can report back. Hellscream's eyes upon you. 
Kill 8 Riverblade Pathstalkers in the areas surrounding Crane Wing Refuge.	Blinding the Riverblades	""A hooded falcon catches no quarry.""This is one of the first mantras we teach young monks at the temple. It means that even a foe as swift and lethal as a falcon can be neutralized by depriving its senses. The saurok have scouts all over the region acting as eyes for their raiding parties. It's time we put their eyes out, don't you think? 
Gather 6 Wasp Stingers from Orchard Wasps.	Quill of Stingers	To achieve perfect paint strokes, one must have the right tools. My own have fallen into disrepair, their bristles becoming as unmanageable as hozu hair. Have you seen the wasps throughout the Arboretum? Their stingers can be fashioned into quills that provide just the right level of sharpness in each line. Could you gather some for me please? 
Collect 4 Snapper Steaks from the Murky Bank.	Silly Wikket, Slickies are for Hozen	You think hozen crazy, wikket? Wait til you see hozen with no slickies! Not enough slickies for hozen and wikkets. Snappers! Hozen hate them ookin' snappers. Wikkets can eat all the snappers!<Eekle Eekle points to the south.> 
Kill 9 Sunreaver Mana Wyrms.	Mana Scavengers	Sometimes, even the smallest creatures can be the biggest threat. The Sunreavers brought mana wyrms with them. Though small in size they have the ability to cripple our casters in combat. Many have learned the hard way not to underestimate them. They must be dealt with and quickly. 
Recover the charter from the Wreck of the Mist-Hopper.	Old Age and Treachery	Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew. I need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker. It's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west. I'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf. 
Slay 10 Orcs at Domination Point.	We Will Rock You	The orcs can NOT be allowed a foothold in this land. They will defile it just as they did Kalimdor.$p, I need boots on the ground and horde in their graves. Get down to the coastline and bring the full force of Alliance wrath down on their heads! Slay any orcs you find. Take the wind out of their sails. For the King! 
Collect 150 Scarab Wings.	Dark Wings, Dark Things	I require another ingredient to create my first poison, Wakener. This ingredient you can easily find on the scarabs nearby. Kill them and bring me their wings. 
Kill 5 Heavy Mooks.	Hammer to Fall	It looks like the Horde thinks they can hide behind their heavy hitting mooks. The mooks are tough, powerful, and dumber than an ogre with a hangover. Go down there and bring the hammer of the Alliance fury down on them! 
Kill the Seed of Doubt.	The Seed of Doubt	The problem with the sha of doubt, Human, is its deceitful pervasiveness. Once the seed of doubt is planted, it can grow like an unwelcome weed. Such a seed has been planted in The Widow's Wail to the north, and like a weed, we must extinguish its presence immediately. I need you to destroy the lingering fragment of doubt before it can infect any more victims. 
Defeat Norvakess, the Terror of the Dread Wastes.	Terror of the Dread Wastes	That thing is huge! The Shado-Pan holding the battlefront were never trained for something like this... let's get down there and take it out ourselves. 
Defeat 4 Sra'thik Kunchong.	The Overwhelming Swarm	I command the sentinels of Niuzao. Every defender out there can hold his own against the mantid swarm. The kunchong, however, are something different. They are massive, violent, and without a question the biggest threat to my sentinels' lives. Only Niuzao stands a chance against them. Niuzao... and perhaps you. 
Free 20 Cloudrunner Hatchlings.	Little Hatchlings	I have seen the cruel experiments that the Shan'ze are performing on their island to the northwest. The Shan'ze raise baby serpents from the egg. They keep the young in tiny cages, surrounded by squalor and filth. The cruelest gaolers starve and torture them. We must save as many hatchlings as we can. You have my full permission to punish any mogu that gets in your way! 
	Infested Jade Statue	 
Evacuate the Blacksoil Family, the Spadepaw Family, the Greentill Family, and the Marlfur Family.	Evacuation Orders	A few farmers remain in the fields... some perilously close to the crumbling wall. I don't want any farmers pretending to be heroes. We will take care of this mantid swarm, and then they can return to their homes. My Shado-Pan are too busy defending this town to organize evacuations. You want to prove yourself useful? Get those farmers out of harm's way. 
Kill any 8 Zandalari trolls within Conqueror's Terrace.	This Just Won't Do	The Zandalari here are very powerful, Mechanic. They should not be underestimated. We cannot afford to ignore them as a threat simply because they do not wield swords. More arrive every day, and with them centuries of magic knowledge. This threat must be dealt with, and quickly. Aid us in clearing this area, Mechanic. Perhaps we can even learn something from them in the process. 
Listen to Xiao and his companions.	The Search for the Hidden Master	Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs. I'm just a visitor... like you. Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I are trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards. 
Disarm the Tactical Mana Bombs at the Horde Ships, the Scrying Crystals, and the Bridge within Dawnseeker Promontory.	Disarming Irony	Well, it would seem the Lady Proudmoore has decided to use our own weaponry against us. Our perimeter wards reported several spies slipping through our defenses carrying tactical mana bombs. I would enjoy the irony if these bombs were less dangerous. Search for these bombs and disarm them. Our wards reported one near the horde ships to the north, one on a bridge to the main isle, and one near our scrying crystals on the eastern side of the Promontory. 
Burn 6 Kunzen Ropes.	You Have to Burn the Ropes	I, umm... well...Oh, never mind. It was a stupid idea. It's just that, I was thinking that maybe we can stop the Kunzen hozen from attacking us without having to, you know... KILL anything. I noticed a few ropes on the side of the mountain. I think they're using them to climb down to our farms and...No, forget it. It was a silly idea anyways. 
Use Ken-Ken's Mask to cure 8 Despondent Wardens of Zhu in Zhu's Watch.	Apply Directly to the Forehead	Well... THAT was unexpected! Come to think of it, now Ken-Ken remember why hozen use mask in the first place...A legend about the Monkey King says he used a mask to cure old pandaren emperor, Shaohao, when he was too sad to lead his people. Then they buried mask--with all his sadness--in the ground. We should use the mask on more pandaren, but instead of putting sad away in ground, we gonna PUNCH ITS BUTT. Let's do this, George! 
Slay the Kunzen Hunter-Chief.	The Kunzen Hunter-Chief	From what I've gathered, the Kunzen hozen have two chiefs. One is harmless - he deals with potions, medicines, and ancient fables. The other one is in charge of the Kunzen's hunters - and the only thing they've been hunting lately is our crops. The Hunter-Chief is a problem waiting to be solved. I'm sure the local farmers would be grateful if you went up there and, you know, ""took care"" of him. 
Recover 8 Spirit Bottles from Shan'ze Spiritclaws in the Terrace of Ten Thunders.	Vessels of the Spirit	The Spiritclaws are a sect of mogu assassin-priests who, at the height of the mogu empire, were the most elite and most feared of the emperor's troops. All have mastered a deathblow which ensnares the spirit of the enemy, trapping it in a jade bottle for delivery to a Spiritbinder. If you encounter any Spiritclaws further ahead in the ruins, take note: their belts hang with a cursed weight. Relieve them of their burden and bring the bottles back to me. 
Recover the Dojani Orders.	The Mogu Agenda	Mogu don't often gather in numbers like this. We should find out what they are up to. I thought I heard someone shouting orders near the center of the ruins. We should probably see if he has information. 
	A Ruby Shard for Chee Chee	 
Find and use Saur Fetishes on 5 raptors, compies, skyscreamers or direhorns in the Beast Pens.	Dino Might	The Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts. Two can play at that game. I want you to find some of these fetishes and try them out on the various beasts in the Beast Pens. Take careful note of how each beast responds to each fetish. Then report your results to me. Maybe this will give us the edge we need against the Zandalari. 
Recover 10 Mogu Artifacts.	Re-Reclaim	Mogu do NOT use arcane magics. They are thugs. They have always been thugs. Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic. But these mogu are using arcane portals and old artifacts. We need to stop them!$p, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw piles of these items being collected near the Ruins of Korja south of here. 
Kill 5 Korune Guardians.	Ancient Guardians	Before the mogu overwhelmed our scouting party, we found relics scattered amongst the ruins to the north. I would like to collect some samples, but the mogu's terracotta watchdogs are too much for us to handle. If you could clear the area of their presence, we will be able to resume our work. 
Obtain 5 Shark Fillets.	Wisdom Has A Price	<Ana listens to your story, and nods.>Crocolisks attacking? I know a story about that. And I will share it with you, but first... I grow hungry. Shark meat should do the trick. You should find enough sharks in the water beneath us. 
Touch 3 Spirits of the Crane.	Chasing Hope	Chi-Ji is always with us. Even when he is not here in the Cradle, pieces of his spirit run through the forests and beaches of the island, watching us and testing us. Prove your dexterity in the eyes of Chi-Ji, George. Find and catch the spirits of the crane. 
	FLAG - Ancient Pandaren Woodcutter	 
Kill 8 Slitherscale Rippers or Slitherscale Eggdrinkers.	Restoring the Balance	The situation at the islands remains dire, George. The Slitherscale saurok have not responded to our attempts at peace, so only one option remains. In order to protect the wild cloud serpents, we must rid the island of their presence. Only then can the cloud serpents be left to live in peace. 
Bring the Scroll of Auspice to Lya of Ten Songs at The Sunset Brewgarden.	Sacred Recipe	""When the horror comes a-risingAnd the heavens hum with warOur great vessel of salvationMust be broken from its core.""The scroll continues on for several stanzas. Perhaps somebody at The Sunset Brewgarden will be able to decipher its cryptic message. 
Ask Jogu the Drunk, Bobo Ironpaw, Farmer Yoon, and Nana Mudclaw what they think of Ella's Brew.	Ella's Taste Test	Well, I finally got the brew made, but I won't know if it's any good unless some people taste it. Would you take my brew and see what the folks in Halfhill think? I... I couldn't face them myself. 
	FLAG - Ship's Storage	 
	FLAG - Swarmkeeper's Crossbow	 
Destroy 15 Dreadspore Bulbs in Zan'vess and The Briny Muck.	Fear Takes Root	The fallout from Shek'zeer's madness will continue long after her reign has ended. We will struggle to heal our lands for many years to come, and even then our efforts may prove fruitless. A new species of sha-twisted flora has begun taking root near Zan'vess. Destroy any that you find, but beware - there is no telling what kind of sinister defenses it may have. 
	FLAG - Boat-Building Instructions	 
Collect 12 pieces of Salvaged Mogu Armor from mogu enemies in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Spoils of War	The warring clans are relentless and our warriors are going through armor faster than I can keep it repaired. If you find yourself in battle with the other clans, see if you can salvage any undamaged armor pieces from their soldiers. We should not let good resources go to waste. 
Destroy the four mantid siege weapons at Sra'vess in Townlong Steppes.	Destroy the Siege Weapons!	The mantid don't just attack in swarms. They're smart. They use alchemy, bombs... and what's worst, they've got siege weapons. Those have the potential to be incredibly destructive if they attack with them. We've got reports that they're building up a force of siege weapons to the west at Sra'vess. Go and destroy them. 
Obtain 100 Virmen Teeth.	Enough is Ookin' Enough	Virmen, they bite too much. They bite Mung-Mung's carrot. They bite Mung-Mung's pumpkin. Mung-Mung try to shoo them away, and the dookers bite Mung-Mung's tail and foot. Enough is ookin' enough. You fight way better than Mung-Mung does. Bring back their bitey teeth. Then we see who does the biting. 
Gather 4 Chunks of Honeycomb, 4 Slick Mudfish, and 4 Salty Cores from Zhu Province.	Materia Medica	Alright, Ken-Ken pretty sure he knows what wrong with pandaren! Got old, old hozen remedy that do the trick. Need to mix honey, fish oil, and salt. Ken-Ken saw lots of beehives in the trees around town, and there must be fish left in the dry ponds. That just leave salt... Mei might know where we can find some. 
Rescue 8 captives of the mogu.	No Sister Left Behind	We were searching the ruins south of here when the mogu fell upon us out of nowhere. Some of us were able to retreat to this encampment but many others were captured. The mogu have also caught a number of the Horde who happened to be in the area as well. Please, $p, rescue any sentinels that you can. Leave the Dawnchasers to their fate. 
Find Lyalia and kill Groundbreaker Brojai.	The Lord Reclaimer	They have my daughter! Brojai... that Lord Reclaimer! I can see him clearly through Lyalia's eyes. That foolish girl must have tried to take him head on. Please, $p! Go to the Ruins of Korja and try to free her. I'll get Kang and try to draw out Brojai from the ruins with a distraction. 
Free 8 Greenstone Miners in the Greenstone Quarry.	Trapped!	<Hao struggles against the rubble with all his might.>HNNNGHHH!!Let me guess: my wife sent you? Imagine that, my delicate little snow lily all worried. Ha ha! She's always frettin' over me. Look--HNNGHH!!!--it'll take more than a little--HNNGGHHH!!--cave-in to keep ol' Hao down. Some o' the boys, on the other hand, are in trouble. Help 'em out if you find any, will ya? I'll be fine. Really. 
Collect Ancient Tiger's Blood.	Profit Mastery: Chasheen	I am totally on to another great scam! When I was flying overhead I saw a really ancient tigress prowling about. Do you know how much her blood would go for on the black market? Not to mention if I convince some warlocks it adds extra potency to their summoning spells or something. If you bring me back some of her blood I will cut you in on the scam. She was prowling about on the far side of the Dojani River from here. 
	FLAG - Ancient Mogu Tablet	 
Kill 12 Dominance Shamans or Dominance Raiders.	Attack! Move!	Sure, they've got about plenty of grunts out there, pounding on our door, waiting to cut our heads off. I'm not worried about grunts. But they've got shamans and raiders, too. The shamans use their magic to empower the grunts, and the raiders are fast and specialize in taking out our buildings. I need you to get out there and kill some of those shamans and raiders. Go! Attack! Move! 
Collect 100 Sri-La Stout.	The Big Brew-haha	It's a disaster, George! When I went to visit the Dancing Serpent Inn yesterday, they were all out of brew. They said the shipment from Sri-La Village had been stolen. STOLEN! Turns out those Oona hozen have been making all kinds of trouble down at the docks, including taking all the brew to their cave at Oona Kagu along the coast. I can't handle a dry spell. A life without brew is not a life worth living! Someone needs to go and save the brew! 
Harvest 8 Ripe Striped Melon plants and provide 40 Striped Melons for the August Celestials.	Work Order: The August Celestials II	Once your striped melons are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up. A trainee from the Cradle of Chi-Ji will be along shortly to collect their order. 
Use the Alliance Flare to call in an airstrike on the Pile of Munitions, the Twinspire Demolishers, the Wild Imps, and Xhu'daggab.	Smoke Before Fire	Sully scouted the Horde establishment to the north, and he reports seeing a large pile of explosives, along with a small force of demolishers. That's not to mention the demons that their warlocks have summoned. Luckily, we came prepared. We've got air support from the Skyfire. We just need to show our pilots where to strike.<Rell hands you a smoke flare, and gives you a knowing nod.> 
	FLAG - Manipulator's Talisman	 
Encourage 12 Pandaren Volunteers to leave the Strongarm Airstrip.	Unreliable Allies	We originally welcomed the Alliance as friends. Several of our villagers volunteered to help them build an airstrip. Only recently, however, did it become clear to us that they were building a war base, within shouting distance of our village. What's worse - I fear that some villagers are being held against their will. If you find them, Mechanic, let them know that it is time to come home. 
Destroy 3 Sra'thik War Wagons.	The Big Guns	The mantid now surround the Temple with their infernal war wagons. The sooner we are rid of those things, the better. You could destroy them with your own weapons and spells, but this will work much faster.<Ogo hands you a few small casks of hastily-packed explosives.>Beware of retaliation from mantid that remain be inside the war wagon when it explodes. In fact, I'd stay as far away from those things as possible. 
Speak to Klaxxi'va Vor in Klaxxi'vess.	Overthrone	The council is in harmony, wakener. Our ritual will bring about the demise of the empress and allow us to secure the future of our great empire. Behold the power of the Klaxxi! 
Slay 10 Skumblade saurok.	The Skumblade Threat	Ihgaluk Crag has no end of saurok. Those beasts attack my men and spread their disease into nearby water and wildlife, interfering with our operations. Thin their numbers, George. Once the Horde takes full control of this island, we can look for more permanent solutions. 
Recover a Charged Moganite and bring it to High Arcanist Savor.	Charged Moganite	We have been dispatching spies into the Kirin Tor base of operations on a daily basis. Some had orders to recover charged moganite from the enemy and bring it here. They have not returned, and I can confirm they have left the Kirin Tor base. Search the jungle between here and there and find any of the charged moganite that might have been lost in transit. Bring it to me and we will put it to good use. 
Retrieve 6 Orchard Tools from Nectarbreeze Orchard.	Orchard-Supplied Hardware	They may not be weaponmasters, but many of these farmers can wield a simple hoe or a rake as an extension of their own will. That mastery coupled with the right motivation could muster a force capable of standing against the mogu. If you can bring back some tools from the orchard, I'll distribute them to anyone willing to fight. 
Kill 15 Sly Foxes.	Fox Mastery	So, when I was scouting east of here I saw a collection of foxes. That's what I first learned to hunt when back on the Wandering Isle. If you want to see the challenge a young pandaren hunter faced when growing up, head east and face off against a bunch of foxes. They tend to be clever and cunning so be on your guard. 
Slay Baldruc and his gryphons.	Gryphon, Down	The Fist of Garrosh will hold position over the harbor until all other threats from the ground are eliminated. Your next target: Baldruc, Theramore's gryphon master. That mad dwarf and his beasts can't be allowed to attack the airship from above. Slay Baldruc, along with his winged charges. 
Bring the Muskpaw Keepsake to Lao Muskpaw.	The Late Mrs. Muskpaw	This well worn trinket has several markings on it confessing love and adoration from the late Mrs. Muskpaw. Perhaps Lao would like his wife's trinket back. 
Listen to Rell's report.	SI:7 Report: Lost in the Woods	<Rell coughs heavily before speaking.>Please, George. You need to hear what we've been through. The whole damned Alliance needs to hear what we've been through. There may not be much time left. 
	A Ruby Shard for Sho	 
Kill 6 Dojani Reclaimers, 8 Dojani Surveyors, and 4 Dojani Enforcers.	Threat from Dojan	While you were at the ruins dusting off tablets for my father I lost five scouts to wandering mogu patrols. These creatures apparently have little interest in peace and are about as trustworthy as the Horde. They are too numerous and we are too weak, however. Go to the ruins west of here and cull the mogu numbers. They won't be expecting a Mechanic. 
Use Imperial Lotus Poultice on 7 Stoneplow Envoys.	The Stoneplow Convoy	Help me, $p. These poor pandaren are in need of healing, and my powers are weakened. I did find an old tome in my collection that allowed me to convert the herbs you collected earlier into a healing poultice. Use this on the injured pandaren and it should get them back on their feet. 
Kill 12 Kun-Lai Scavengers.	Honor, Even in Death	Hmm... If Shado-Master Chong trusted you, perhaps you can help us. The yaungol are our enemies. Still, we must prove we are better than they. We will show them honor in death. As after most battles, the carrion birds have begun gathering. Thin their numbers, so the bodies of our foes will not be desecrated. They've gathered at the battlefield to the west. 
Obtain 4 Spare Planks and some Tough Kelp.	Build Your Own Raft	<Jay looks off in the direction of Kea Krak.>Hmm. They don't seem to be... calming down. We're going to have to try something different. You'll need a raft. Go grab some wood planks and seaweed, and bring them over to me. I'll put something together for you. 
Obtain an Uncut Chrysoberyl.	A Gift For Tina	That Tina Mudclaw is in the Halfhill Market today, visiting her sister. She's really nice, but she's really hard to get gifts for! There's a little jewel that can be found in the cliffs to the north. It's called a chrysoberyl, and it changes color when you hold it. I'll bet she doesn't have one of THOSE! Look inside the virmen caves. I bet you'll find one really fast. 
Obtain Spicy Shrimp Dumplings.	A Gift For Ella	That poor Ella. She's so shy! I saw her standing in the Halfhill Market, looking really hungry, but afraid to talk to any of the chefs. We should bring her some food! And not any boring food - something special. The Kunzen hozen make spicy shrimp dumplings from ingredients they've stolen from our farms. I don't like spicy food, but Ella might! 
Gather an Opalescent Blue Crab Shell and 8 Stolen Pandaren Spices.	The Scent of Life	Many have perished here. We will need to honor them properly, which means gathering the makings of incense of life. It doesn't just smell nice - it has restorative properties, and can even help plants grow. Maybe I can get a whiff of the ingredients to get me back on my feet. The materials can be found on creatures around here - except for the spices, which were stolen by the mercenaries who pillaged the village. 
Find Anduin at the Tomb of Conquerors. Speak to Fennie Hornswaggle at Lion's Landing for transportation.	The Harmonic Mallet	$p! Prince Anduin has somehow slipped his guards again. His control over the light is greatly increasing. He was last seen heading to Kun-Lai Summit. He gave our mages the slip around the Valley of Emperors. Can you find him? He insists on searching for what he claims is a counter to the Divine Bell. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him before he seizes control of your mind and has you dance your way back here. Talk to Fennie for a ride into the mountains. 
Return to Instructor Skythorn at the Arboretum in the Jade Forest.	The Rider's Journey	Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed. In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum. 
Return to Farmhand Ko at Eastwind Rest in Kun-Lai Summit.	Back to Eastwind Rest	Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do. I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest. And, since you helped them out, they want to join your ""Horde"". So, who am I to stop 'em? Bring 'em with you, back to Farmhand Ko. I'll miss 'em, but they're better off with you. 
Slay 12 Sunreavers in the Dalaran Sewers.	Sewer Cleaning	Jaina's doing a good job taking care of Sunreavers above ground, but there's still plenty rooting around in the sewers. Go find those lying rats and exterminate them! 
	Tracking Quest: Ghost Pirate Battle - Completed	 
Gather 4 Dread Amber Foci from Vor'thik Fear-Shapers at Kypari Vor.	Concentrated Fear	Amber is power. It brings life. This... dread amber you brought me has been twisted. It is concentrated fear. The Vor'thik know this well. Their kypari has been completely engulfed by sha, and they use the dread amber to quicken their own swarmborn. Bring me the crystals used by the Vor'thik fear-shapers in their rituals. The Klaxxi will study them and decide on a protocol for disposal. 
Find the three Scout-o-Matics in Domination Point.	A Kind of Magic	Greetings $p! I have heard a lot about your success in the field. I would like to use your services to test my latest ""Siege-o-Matic"", a device of terrible and varied abilities. I promise it is mostly harmless to its users. When you are around Domination Point be on the look out for my Scout-o-Meters. They have been dispatched to get info on good siege targets. When you find one, activate it and I will pilot a Siege-o-Matic to your location. See you in the field... as it were. 
Plant 8 Red Blossom Leek Seeds on Sunsong Ranch.	Work Order: Dominance Offensive I	<Yoon's writing decorates the page though his feelings seem conflicted.>I normally try to stay out of conflict, but an order is an order. Since you are of the Horde I decided to pass this order your way. The Dominance Offensive has requested an order of red blossom leeks. The troops down there just can't seem to get enough of them! 
Speak to Yalia Sagewhisper to begin the ceremony. Then, activate the Totem of Kindness, the Totem of Tranquility, and the Totem of Serenity.	What Lies Beneath	If my suspicions are correct, this place still reels from some lingering darkness. Whatever happened here... it could not have been the natural course of events. Even the yaungol are not so brutal as to slaughter their own kind to the point of... this. I will use the totems that you brought me to perform a cleansing ritual. I need someone to assist me in the ceremony. Let me know when you are ready. 
Obtain 11 Mao-Willows.	A Proper Poultice	A dry bandage doesn't do much good, other than maybe keeping bugs out of the wound. In some camps, that's the best you can hope for. Not in my camp, though. I prefer to make a paste from whatever soothing herbs I can find, and layer that between bandages. The most soothing herbs I've been able to find in the field are the Mao-Willows from the fields in the northeast. If you run into any, bring them back. 
Bring a Sprig of Dreamleaf to Yan in New Cifera.	The Golden Dream	Ashyo must have experienced what we call the golden dream. Many of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body. There IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier. Bring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you. 
	Chose Prot Warrior	 
Defeat 10 Zandalari trolls in the Beast Pens.	Saur Loser	Inside the Beast Pens you will encounter some of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw. This is where they build their cavalry. We need you to kill any Zandalari you find in there before they can get their mounted monstrosities out into the open battlefield. 
Rescue a Shado-Pan Trainee in each of the north, central and south Kunchong feeding pits.	Friends, Not Food!	Our scouts have sent a very troubling report. Three of our trainees have gone missing, and our scouts found them... They've been captured by the mantid and sent to their Kunchong pits. Their Kunchong FEEDING pits. We're lucky that the Kunchong don't eat that often. I need you to get in there, give them these escape kites, and get them out! 
	FLAG - Yaungol Fire Carrier	 
Challenge and defeat Husshun at the Tian Monastery.	Husshun, the Wizened	The jinyu are long-standing allies of the pandaren, and we welcome any of their kind into our monastery. Husshun, one of their elder shaman, is one of our newest trainees. His skills as a monk are mediocre at best, but he is still a fierce combatant. He should provide you with the challenge that you deserve. 
Find 20 Imperial Lotus Leaves.	Herbal Remedies	Kang's remedy isn't working. There is something else at work here. A power deep beneath the soil. It is sapping us of hope, hitting us with depression and despair. Kang tells me this land has lotus plants. I might be able to make a tea that would hopefully lend Leza some strength. Please, $p, search the ruins south and west of here for lotus leaves. I will pay you for your efforts. 
Kill the Mogujia Soul-Caller.	Mogu?! Oh No-gu!	I know your friends are worried about the animating statues over at Mogujia, but I'll tell you what you should really be worried about. Where there are animated statues, there are Mogu. I don't know if you've seen one before, but if you haven't...Well, let's just say Mogu are bad, bad, news. While you're dealing with whatever else you're doing, you need to get the Mogu behind the trouble! 
Kill 5 Raptors and 10 Trained Saurid in the Beast Pens.	Compy Stomp	The raptors and saurid of the Zandalari represent a substantial threat to our forces here. They are superb hunting beasts that can track prey over great distances and are often lethal to encounter when caught unawares. I need you to head into the Beast Pens and cull their numbers. We need to make sure to slay them before they are fully trained. 
Locate Scout Captain Daelin within Conqueror's Terrace.	No Time To Rest	We have accomplished much since arriving here, but now is not the time to rest. Your efforts have helped us breach the upper level of the Thunder King's stronghold. Now, I call on you to continue our campaign. Report to Scout Captain Daelin within Conqueror's Terrace. He will have further orders for you. 
Speak to Foreman Raike at the Serpent's Heart in the Jade Forest.	The Serpent's Heart	You've done great here, kid. Thanks to you, we have quite a bit of extra jade, and I know just the someone who could use it. My friend Foreman Raike is running the great statue project at the Serpent's Heart. Bring a shipment of extra jade to him, and tell him his old friend Mann says hello. He'll be eagerly waiting your arrival. 
Kill 15 sha invaders.	The Darkness Around Us	Despite our best efforts, the sha broke the seals around the main temple. If we cannot hold them back here, their darkness will spread to the rest of the Jade Forest. We need your help immediately. Kill any sha creatures that you see. They should not be difficult to find. 
Bring the Beautiful Brooch to Tina Mudclaw at Haohan's House or Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds.	A Beautiful Brooch	It is a very old, antique brooch with very detailed molding and filigree worked into the edges. It looks very valuable. There's only one person who keeps losing jewelry to furry hooligans, and she would probably want to see this heirloom returned. 
	FLAG - Lost Adventurer's Belongings	 
Kill 12 Cliff Kites.	Mission: Aerial Threat	I've identified another high risk target, one that most people would not suspect. The cliff kites soaring above the hills to the east are quite dangerous. I have seen them swooping down to the farms, snatching grain and seed when no one is looking. In order to protect the farms, we must thin their numbers. 
Collect 8 Dark Pitch.	Perfect Pitch	When the Osul tribe goes to war, they coat their spears and arrows with a highly flammable, ever-burning pitch. They use this terrible weapon to shed not only blood, but to raze the homes of their enemies. I need you to collect some of this pitch while you are in their camp. We will use it to show the yaungol that when you play with fire, you can get burned. 
	Auctioning for Parts	 
Obtain an Essence of the Iron Protector.	Essence of the Iron Protector	Redeem your Essence of the Iron Protector with Lady Liadrin to select an armament of your choice. 
Obtain 12 chunks of Jovite Ore from within Kuuro's Claim.	Out of Jovite	Crafting good equipment requires the best metal and some of the best metal is the jovite that comes from the mine in Kuuro's Claim, just east of here. In order to supply the arsenal I'm going to need this metal. Unfortunately the place was recently overwhelmed by a pack of goren so you're going to have to fight your way in to get the ore before they manage to devour it. Nothing that should be too much of a problem for you, <sir/ma'am>. 
Rip 3 Pieces of Bark off of Slumbering Ancients in Zangarra.	Forming the Scroll	For this plan to work, we'll need infused parchment. The latent arcane energy at this nexus quickly froze the ancients in place and settled in their bark. If we rip off strips from the few that haven't been destroyed by the fungal creatures, I can form them into parchment. 
Release 3 Captive Gronn.	Wrath of Gronn	The Thunderlord are capturing gronn for the Iron Horde. Show these fools why gronn are NOT pets. Follow us into Grulloc's Grotto and sunder the chains of the captive gronn. Let the beasts seek to gain their own vengeance against the Thunderlord. Meet us at Grulloc's Lair beneath the grotto when you are done. 
Defeat the three arena champions of Fangri'la.	Rumble in the Jungle	Dem fancy cat-men gotta be shown who is da boss 'round dese parts. Kill all their champions, and ya will earn da respect of all creatures in da jungle. Y'gonna need dese totems to draw dem out. 
Find Admiral Taylor at Admiral Taylor's Farm.	Admiral Taylor	Admiral Taylor had figured out who was behind all this. He told us to save who we could... he wanted to handle matters himself. We never heard from him again, but we have our orders. Please... please find him. He went towards the farm. 
Defend Frostfire Ridge from the Iron Horde.	The Battle of Thunder Pass	The Iron Horde has an army tenfold our number marching down the Thunder Pass as we speak. Durotan is amassing our forces at the mouth of the pass. He is doing what he can to mount a defense but war on this scale is not what we Frostwolves are masters of. He will need your expertise. Please, go to him. 
Defeat the ancient black rylak and douse Gronnsbane in its blood. Once empowered, return the weapon to Bodrick Grey for your reward.	Gronnsbane: The Blessing of Beasts	Gronnsbane now pulses with energies of fire and frost. All that remains to restore the full power of the weapon is to receive the Blessing of the Beast. Argoram believed this could be accomplished by bloodying the weapon against one of the ancient black rylaks of Stonefury Cliffs. His journal reads:""High in the Stonefury Cliffs, I have seen an altar where the ogres have left offerings to these ancient beasts. Perhaps I could use it to lure one of them"" 
Use the Firebomb Plunger then ride on Kimzee's Flying Machine.	Flame On	Alright George, we've saved as many as we could but now we need to make sure this disaster doesn't spread any further. The firebombs are wired up and ready to go. Kimzee just finished work on the flying machine so we're ready to ride back to the Gearworks as soon as we're finished. You've done all the hard work so I think you should get the honors of triggering it. 
Search near the entrance of the Pillars of Fate for evidence of Artificer Maatun's crystal.	Treasure Contract: The Artificer	I have heard of a draenei artificer by the name of Maatun that was seeking to restore an old draenei crystal, possibly of naaru origin. He called the crystal the Dream of Argus. The draenei went missing after seeking out help from the Shadowmoon orcs back before they allied themselves with the Iron Horde. One of your scouts recently spotted a draenei matching the description of Maatun near the entrance of the Pillars of Fate. Go there and see what you can dig up. 
Find Crystal-Shaper Barum near Aruuna in Talador.	As the Smoke Rises	Aruuna burns. The arakkoa swooped down from their spires and are turning everything to ash. Draenei, talbuk, even orc; they care not for allegiances. They merely want to watch the world burn. I barely escaped with my life, but my best friend, Barum, stayed behind to find his daughter. The others all say you are a great champion. Please, I beg of you, go to Aruuna and find them. 
Hear Cordana Felsong's tale.	Safe Passage	Being a human and a night elf, the archmage and I aren't likely to be well-received by the orcs of the Frostwolf clan. We need you to make an introduction for us with the Throm'var farseer. There is much to discuss. Shall I bring you up to speed on the way to the village? 
Kill 100 Gladiators at the Coliseum in Highmaul. You may access the Coliseum by talking to Kharg at Highmaul or Boneslag at your Gladiator's Sanctum.	Fight, Kill, Salute!	The greatest gladiators on Draenor have fought for glory and honor inside the Coliseum. Will you become a legend like Kargath Bladefist or will you be nothing more than bone dust beneath the boots of a more savage gladiator? There is only one way to find out. You must enter the competition and fight! The price of victory is 100 lives! I will admit you without cost once per day, but if you fail and wish to fight again you must pay the price of admission in blood and bone! 
Speak to Samaara at Embaari Village.	A Hero's Welcome	Prophet Velen has asked me to show you around Shadowmoon Valley. We will go first to Embaari Village, where my sister Samaara is waiting for us. I have not seen her since the Iron Horde took me to Tanaan. The village is just one of many trading villages between the Temple of Karabor and Shattrath. Follow the road east and make your way to Embaari Village. I will accompany you, my friend. 
Find Grinning Tolg's journal among the mutated orcs in Everbloom Wilds.	Treasure Contract: The Infected Orc	In Gorgrond, the Laughing Skull clan has a legend of one called Skulltaker. His mask, known only as the Silent Skull, is legendary among the clan, and could help us learn more about them. Until recently, he was thought to have vanished. Now it appears he has shown his face, so to speak, in Everbloom Wilds. The last orc to have seen him fell to the botani there, but may still have some clues on how you can find Skulltaker and recover the mask. If the botani have him, he may not be cooperative. 
Find Altauur at Dionor's Demise in Gorgrond.	Seeking the Scout	We are still trying to locate all of our scouts out in the field. One of these, Altauur, enjoys handling the more dangerous missions. He has not checked in and I feel we should check to make sure he has not taken on more than he can handle. 
Speak to Rangari Rajess to fly to the Iron Approach and attack the Iron Horde.	Strike While the Iron is Hot	With the Heart of the Magnaron, we wield a powerful weapon against the Iron Horde. They amass far to the north at the Iron Approach. This will not be easy, but we must seize the opportunity to deal a blow to the Iron Horde while we possess the artifact. We are prepared to depart at your command. Speak with Rangari Rajess when you are ready. 
Choose a follower (either Greatmother Geyah, Kal'gor the Honorable, or Lokra) and then speak with Makar Stonebinder.	The Frostwolves Stand Ready	Though we have lost much this day, the Frostwolves stand ready to uphold our pact with your people. To honor this agreement, some of my clan have asked to join your ranks and fight alongside your forces. Our numbers are strained so I ask that you chose only one. Speak with me when you have made your decision. 
Collect a Bass Blaster, Laz-Tron Disc Reader, Phonic Amplifier, S.P.R.K. Capacitor, and a Cord of Ancient Wood.	Bringing the Bass	It's a bit quiet around here, in between the invasions and all. You're in luck though, Commander! I can fix that, and boost morale among your troops all at the same time. All you need to do is bring me a few items from around Draenor, and I'll fill your garrison with music. I'll even throw in a few music rolls from my own collection to get you started! What do you say? 
Speak to Bron Skyhorn the Wingman to secure a flight to the Pinchwhistle Gearworks.	Pinchwhistle Gearworks	Commander, a courier arrived this morning. He said he's from a goblin settlement in Spires of Arak called the Pinchwhistle Gearworks. They've asked for our assistance with some sort of ecological disaster. We're spread thin but if we can earn their trust then we might be able to gain a valuable ally. Head down there and see what sort of assistance we can provide. I've already spoken to the flight master and he's set up a special flight to get you out there. 
Inspect the Drafting Table and choose which outpost structure to construct.	Orders, Commander?	Commander, our status report is... regrettable. We'll be out of supplies in a few days' time, and that's assuming we have any troops left by then. There's just enough material left to put up an inn or a trading post. The inn would allow us to station fresh troops here, but the trading post would open up potential supply routes with the outcasts nearby. I've left out Gazlowe's blueprints on the drafting table. We await your will. 
Choose a follower (either Andren, Chel, or Onaala) and then speak with Exarch Naielle.	Friend of the Exarchs	Only three members remain of the Exarch Council, but we are all deeply indebted to you. The vote is unanimous: Your Alliance will have our full support on Draenor. We are also going to place a draenei representative under your direct command. Three potential candidates are here in the courtyard. Speak to them and choose who you want - we will dispatch him or her immediately to your garrison! 
Confront Ner'zhul.	Shadows Awaken	We've managed to pin Ner'zhul inside the Observatory, but he's taken many down with him. He has taken Yrel's sister, Samaara. I am needed to hold the line here. Please, do whatever you can to save her, hero. 
Collect 5 Iron Horde Scraps from Iron Horde on Draenor.	Scraps of Iron	At the armory, we can take scraps of Iron Horde armor that you collect and turn them into new gear. It's not the strongest stuff in the world, but it looks good. Get some Iron Horde scraps and come back my way. I'll set you up with a nice tabard for your troubles. 
Save Wor'gol from the Thunderlord clan.	Save Wolf Home	Cowardly Thunderlords...During the battle for the citadel, runners informed me that the Iron Wolf is striking at our home. He'll find no easy footing there, Draka will make them pay tenfold for any of ours that they slay, but we must return quickly and chase the mongrels off. You and your forces have proven valuable allies of the Frostwolves. We'd welcome your aid in securing our Wor'gol. I'll see you on the battlefield if you choose to come. 
Speak to Apprentice Miall just outside of Fort Wrynn in Talador.	The Quarry Quandary	Now that we have the artillery tower built, we're going to need some skilled hands to run it. I've heard that Ared, one of the best smiths in Shattrath, managed to escape the city's fall. He should be just outside the north wall with the rest of the refugees. See if you can convince him to work for us. 
Search Gloomshade Grove for clues.	Gloomshade Grove	<This looks like one of the pack mules from your garrison. It's strange that it's wandering out here alone. You probably should investigate.> 
Summon and defeat Invalidus.	The Shadow of the Void	The moment has come to take on the void lord. Invalidus grows more powerful by the minute, so you must move with haste if you are to defeat the monster. At each of the Warsong ritual locations there is a void crystal; these crystals are used to channel the energy of the void from within the Twisting Nether. Disturb the crystal, and Invalidus will sense your presence below. Be ready, as soon as the crystal is disturbed, Invalidus will waste no time hunting you down. 
Enter the Hunter's Hall in Grom'gar and defeat the Iron Wolf.	The Iron Wolf	My brother Ga'nar stands beside me. Wor'gol, Stonefang, and your garrison hold strong. Our clan is united, and the Thunderlord are already on the run. We are ready. The time has come to face this ""Iron Wolf."" 
Place 5 Pentangulate-o-tron 2000s.	Setting the Signal	<Sir/Ma'am>, we built a vehicle to bypass the Horde camp and take you to the Throne of Kil'jaeden! There's one problem, the concentrated fel energy up there is causing the navigation system to go haywire! I'll need you to place some sensors along the edge of the summit. With them in place we can stabilize the flight controls. Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious! 
	Abu'gar	 
Follow Prophet Velen.	Finding a Foothold	So, you are the one that has led my children home? I have been waiting for you. The Iron Horde grows stronger every day. I have foreseen a great battle, but my visions are clouded. It's as if time is sitting on top of itself. One thing is certain, your presence here is of great importance. 
Collect 10 Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragments from any Treasure or from any Rare or Rare Elite creature in Tanaan Jungle.	Unseen Influence	The corruption in the Apexis has begun to affect many of my people. We are so accustomed to the power it grants us that more succumb to the whispers every day. You must bring me more samples so I can free my people from yet another curse. 
Find a Laughing Skull clansman.	The Laughing Skull	Ah, $p, good. I need someone who is not of my clan to negotiate with the Laughing Skull. We could use their help navigating this land, but they are dangerous and unpredictable, much like Gorgrond itself. Follow this road and seek out someone willing to speak with you. Perhaps they will see you as something new and be willing to talk first and stab later. 
Free 6 Frost Wolves or Wor'gol Villagers.	Free Our Brothers and Sisters	These Thunderlord curs use coward's weapons like nets and chains. Many of our villagers and wolf-brothers and sisters have been trapped. If you free them, they will fight at your side with honor. We must quell this attack with haste so I may return to Bladespire Citadel and continue my preparations. 
Gather the Ango'rosh Spellbook and the Grimoire of Binding, then perform the ritual at the Altar of Ango'rosh in the Ango'rosh Ruins.	Desperate Measures	We've identified the location of Teron'gor's compound, but his forces are already far stronger than anything we've ever faced. We need to gain an edge, and quickly. The cursed spirits of the Ango'rosh ogres, our ancient enemies, linger in nearby ruins. Go there and gather the Ango'rosh Spellbook and the Grimoire of Binding. Perform the ritual described within at their altar to lift their curse and seek their aid. It's a long shot, but we don't have any other options. 
Search the ogres in the Broken Precipice for clues regarding Goldspade's discovery.	Treasure Contract: Gutrek's Cleaver	In Nagrand, the ogres tell of an ancient weapon called Gutrek's cleaver. I would very much like to study it. A goblin treasure hunter by the name of Val Goldspade discovered the whereabouts of the weapon. Unfortunately, this goblin has gone missing somewhere in the Broken Precipice - probably after a run-in with the locals. 
Interrogate Shattered Hand orcs in the Harvesting Pits to find out the name and location of ""G.V."".	The Power of Poison	G.V.? We need a full name. A location! I have an idea fer how we can find those out.<Hulda pulls out a small vial.>This is my last vial o' wracking poison. We use it when we need tae extract information from prisoners. Coat yer weapon wi' it and head into the Shattered Hand camp just ahead. Engage them as normal and demand answers - the poison will take care o' the rest. 
Watch the construction of your garrison by using the Master Surveyor	Establish Your Garrison	It's time for the main event! We've got the materials, we've got the manpower, we've got another thing that starts with ""m.""Let's build this thing! I got a gaggle of assistants up on that ridge to the west. They should have your personal surveying stand set up by now. Head on over there and you should be able to watch our progress from it. 
Find Ner'zhul.	The Dark Side of the Moon	Yrel and I have located Warlord Ner'zhul. He is meeting with Grommash Hellscream atop the highest altar overlooking Anguish Fortress. Meet us there. We must stop him. 
Speak with Limbflayer at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	The Sparring Arena	We owe you our freedom, and more. I have spoken to the others, we are willing to return with you to your garrison and teach those pitiful creatures you call ""soldiers"" how to properly fight. We will also do our best to impart our knowledge to you, Commander. Should you have need of us when in the wilds of Gorgrond, simply call us. You may wish to warn Limbflayer of our coming. 
Collect 2500 garrison resources, 2500 gold and complete 25 naval treasure missions.	Naval Domination	Our naval domination continues! However, we are going to need even more experience and resources to take this shipyard to the next level. Once we reach our goals, we can upgrade the capacity of the shipyard to hold even more ships! 
Defeat Crushmaul in the Ring of Trials.	Ring of Trials: Crushmaul	So you want to fight in the Ring of Trials do you? It's your funeral, bub! Your first fight is against an exceptionally large and angry ogre named Crushmaul. That's not all though, you'll have to take out his armored boar companion too; Crushmaul never goes into the ring without him! I hope your affairs are in order, because the last gladiator that fought Crushmaul went home in a body bag...I'm counting on you! Get your ass inside the arena and speak with my associate Guzrug to start the fight! 
Speak with Vindicator Yrel at the Gates of Grommashar and lead the assault on the Warsong.	And Justice for Thrall	The time has come, commander. You've dealt with all of the Warsong's allies and holdings. Our troops are massing at the gates of Grommashar. The rangari have reliable intel that Garrosh is holed up inside the Warsong fortress. All of our efforts have led to this moment. Let's take out Garrosh. 
Speak to Bodrick Grey at your garrison in Shadowmoon Valley.	News from Spires of Arak	While you were gone, a rather shady looking human arrived at the outpost asking for you. He said he worked for... Grey was it?... and had some information regarding Spires of Arak that you would be interested in. He was heading back to your garrison and asked that I passed along the message, and so I have. And before you go, thank you for all you've done for us here, truly. You and your army have turned the tides of a war that you could have just as easily walked away from. We will not forget. 
Speak the password to Reshad in Skettis.	The Shadows of Skettis	My people flee our homeland in droves. I sell trinkets to ease the journey. But I see that you are not interested in trinkets... No, what you seek are answers. Skettis lies just ahead. Once a great city built by Terokk as a refuge for the unwanted. Now a ruined slum. An old storyteller lives there - a scrollkeeper named Reshad. Find him and speak these words: ""Shadows gather."" He will know you are a friend. Now go. Your presence is bad for business. 
Collect 1000 garrison resources, 1000 gold and combat 15 naval missions.	Upgrading The Fleet	You have been doing a great job out there commander. However, we are going to need more experience and resources to upgrade this shipyard. Once we reach our goals, we can upgrade the capacity of the shipyard to hold more ships! 
Find Ner'zhul.	Darkness Falls	It is already beginning, over the hills to the southeast. Ner'zhul has everything he needs to summon the Dark Star. The Iron Horde attack on Karabor is imminent. This is where everything ends. Champion, I must ask you to ride ahead and delay Ner'zhul. I will join you as quickly as I can. 
Use the Drafting Table to craft a Lumber Yard or a Sparring Arena.	We Need An Outpost	Commander, we've gathered enough materials to build an outpost that will support our mission against the Iron Horde. How shall we proceed? A lumber yard would be valuable for gathering resources in the dense overgrowth to the south, and in confronting the plant monstrosities that defend it. On the other hand, a sparring arena would provide us the brutish forces we'd need to push through the magnaron wastelands to the north. When you're ready, make your choice on the table. 
Slay Master Siegesmith Uratok in Grom'gar.	The Master Siegesmith	Not long ago, the most advanced weapon a Thunderlord could make was a really, really big spear. The Blackrock orcs must have shipped in a fearsome master to have them producing cannons so rapidly. We need to find that master. 
Search the ruins of upper Skettis for the Arakkoa research involving the Amulet of Rukhmar.	Treasure Contract: Amulet of Rukhmar	It seems the Adherents of Rukhmar have stumbled upon some information leading to an ancient amulet, said to possess the power of their god and bestow it upon the wearer. We should make sure they don't find it. Head to Skettis and find what they have learned. Hopefully we can find it before they get to it. 
	Grumpy	 
Place 5 Firebombs within Pinchwhistle Point.	Preventing the Worst	Have you seen all the fungus on the buildings in Pinchwhistle Point? It's only a matter of time 'til it releases enough spores to infest the whole coastline! The remaining infected that are in Pinchwhistle Point will be too far gone for us to save later on, so let's do the right thing and put them out of their misery and prevent an even worse outbreak. I made some firebombs that will burn the fungus down, but I'll need you to place them while I set up the detonator. Are you up for it? 
	The Howling Crag	 
Find Ga'nar near Daggermaw Ravine.	Ga'nar's Vengeance	My brother's head is as thick as his axe and he is as stubborn as a gronn. When Ga'nar left he took with him some of the finest warriors in the clan and headed north to the Daggermaw Ravine. If they are still out there, you must find them. Ga'nar will not listen to me. Help him see his vengeance through if you must but please bring him back to us. 
Meet Cordana Felsong outside of Thom'var in the Frostwind Crag.	Vouchsafe Our Arrival	A matter of great importance has arisen. While you were away, Archmage Khadgar contacted me. He is investigating demonic influences to the north. Being a human, the Frostwolves will not accept Khadgar without you there to vouch for him, nor will they accept a night elf such as myself. I will wait for you outside Throm'var in the Frostwind Crag. 
Enter the Sanctum of the Naaru.	The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun	We are not far from the inner chamber, George. The truth behind the evil here awaits us. I can project my spirit into the chamber to guide you, but it will be up to you to defeat the evil that lays within. May the wind of Kalandrios guide your arm, the wisdom of Aborius enlighten your faculties, and the flame of Incineratus burn your enemies. May the memory of Gordawg be your shield. 
Use the Fragment of Anguish at the main doorway. Then destroy the Mark of Darkness, Mark of Shadows, and Mark of Anguish.	Into Anguish	Rulkan's gift to you, the Fragment of Anguish, will allow you to pass into the fortress unhindered. Go up these stairs to the doorway, then use the fragment to enter the compound. Once you are inside, you will find three altars powering the magical barrier around their stronghold. Destroy these runes, and Yrel and I will be able to join you in finding Ner'zhul. 
Destroy the Thunderlord Cache, Blackrock Forge, and Log Storage.	Thaelin's Quick Fix	Those orcs sure like to pile things up in one place. That gave me an idea...I've built this ingenious device for ya! When you get near a target, it'll let you know, and you can deploy it for a big, satisfying, kerBOOM! 
Install the Blast Furnace equipment on your ship and complete the Naval Blockade mission.	A True Naval Commander	Yes! Those are the blueprints I misplaced when I was fishing last week. These instructions match my prototype equipment one for one. Take this Blast Furnace and install it on one of our ships. This should let us break the naval blocade and expand our control of the Draenor seas. 
Help Fiona brew a curative elixir.	Cooking With Unstable Herbs	The base is boiling and ready for those ingredients. Add each of the ingredients, one at a time, and I will handle the mixing and frothing. Speak to me when you are ready. 
Commune with the furies at the Throne of Elements.	Called to the Throne	I was far from here in Talador when the voice called out to me. I looked around but found myself alone. Again, I heard the voice as if it were a breeze in my mind.""You are needed at the throne,"" it whispered. The voice called itself Kalandrios, and it guided me to this place. I had never been here before, nor had I yet beheld these furies with my eyes; yet this feels strangely familiar to me as if it happened long ago in a forgotten dream. We should greet the furies and hear them out. 
Kill 15 demons in Gul'rok.	Retribution for the Light	There are agents of darkness everywhere, fighting tooth and nail to envelop the world. The Light relies on us to balance the scale. You have the power needed to destroy Teron'gor's demonic minions once and for all. Send them to the Twisting Nether in pieces! 
Speak with Shadow Sage Iskar in Veil Terokk.	Back from Beyond	We must begin preparations for the Talon King's return. From within this realm, I can travel quickly to Veil Terokk. You, however, should be returned to the other side. You are powerful, and will attract unwanted attention. 
Survive the Burning Blade's trial by combat and retrieve the Garrison Blueprints.	Challenge of the Masters	The time has come to challenge the Burning Blade masters. Go to the back of the cavern. There you will find the challenge ring and the masters watching over it from above. Pull the blade from the middle of the ring to issue your challenge. My clan values honor above all else and will respect your claim to trial by combat. As reward, you will be allowed to walk away with your blueprints and your life. Or, you will be dead. 
Collect 100 Tanaan Jungle Teeth from the various wildlife within Tanaan Jungle.	Tooth and Claw	These wimps lugging wood around the jungle keep talking about how dangerous it is. You know, between the ravager den to the south or the raptors that stalk Zorammarsh - hey, even the beach creatures or podlings have teeth! What do you say you and I do a little hunting? Collect teeth from wild beasts. The bigger the beast, the more teeth. Meet me back here and we'll compare our haul! 
Meet Kronk Rustspark at the docks.	Equipping Our Fleet	Commander, our fleet is going to require some custom naval equipment if we hope to stand a chance in this war. Find Kronk Rustspark down at the docks, he should be able to help us out. 
Bring Kil'uun's Beak to Beastmaster Tagh.	WANTED: Kil'uun	It's that damned bird! Every few hours, this blasted thing flies right past here, and none of these idiots will stop it.""It's got the crazy in its eyes,"" they tell me. Pah! Commander, this bird will be the end of me. If you see it, could you cut off its stupid head and give it to me? It'd make me feel better. 
Retrieve the Fungal Brain from Dirgemire.	Dirgemire	In order to fully understand the nature and properties of the Zangarium Draenormycota, I need to examine the strain within a complex fungal structure. The fungal brain of a spore giant would do nicely. Not just any spore giant will serve though, it needs to be big... mean... primordial... the perfect specimen! In a cavern deep below the surface is an ancient spore giant the locals fearfully refer to as Dirgemire. Slay the monster, but be sure to carefully preserve the fungal brain for our research! 
Speak with Lokra at Stonefang Outpost.	Securing the South	We have an outpost to the southeast that was boxed in by Thunderlord forces as they marched through the canyons to Wor'gol. I have sent reinforcements to secure the outpost and press east to Grom'gar. We will push the Thunderlords out of our lands completely, and pursue them all the way back to that reeking corpse they call home. Draka's sister, Lokra, was among the orcs who volunteered to clean up Stonefang Outpost. 
	The Forgotten Caves	 
Retrieve the Eye of Anzu.	Syth's Secret	Our deceased friend here was hiding more than a love of old scrolls and erotic sorcery-fiction. He had something truly valuable. If I'm reading his notes correctly, he claims to have found the Eye of Anzu - Terokk's scrying orb from the days after his fall. We need that orb! The notes say he stashed it in a ravager den just up the road. 
Escort your garrison forces to the Temple of Karabor by slaying all the orcs in the Path of Light.	The Righteous March	The Iron Horde have overtaken Karabor. If we don't act now, we will lose the city. Exarch Akama and the last of our forces are trapped within the city, but your garrison forces are still outside the temple, awaiting your orders. Come and fly with me. We will meet your forces on the field. With the naaru by our side, we will make one last charge to retake the city! 
Enter Veil Terokk with Reshad.	A Gathering of Shadows	Veil Terokk is just ahead. Let us hope the others have made the journey safely. 
Use the QR58 Flame Blaster to destroy 20 Spore Pustules.	Defungination	Have you seen the fungus out there in the water? It's growing faster than a baby ravasaur from Un'goro, and if we don't get it under control, the Gearworks is gonna be ruined like our last village. Uncle Krixel used to tell me to burn away the red fungus because that's what makes it grow so fast. You could help us out by taking a flame blaster and clearing out some of those spores down in the shallows. 
Find the Ancestor's Totem in the cave beneath Exile's Rise.	Ancestor's Memory	I believe that you should know the price of the lives you take. So before I will help you find Ner'zhul, you must understand why he joined the Iron Horde. In a cave beneath this village is an artifact that we call the Ancestral Totem. On it is carved the names of every Shadowmoon clan member since its founding. The opening of the cave lies directly south. I will meet you there. 
Locate the Thunderlord sage Argoram in Magnarok.	Treasure Contract: The Thunderlord Sage	In Frostfire Ridge, a Thunderlord sage by the name of Argoram seems to have uncovered the whereabouts of a storied weapon, known to the orcs as Gronnsbane. He was last spotted headed into Magnarok. Find him and see if he can lead you to this relic. 
Speak with Drek'Thar at the crash site in Frostfire Ridge.	The Home of the Frostwolves	You have arrived in Frostfire Ridge. Farseer Drek'Thar can guide you from here. 
Destroy Mongrethod in the Remains of Xandros.	Destination: Unknown	Teron'gor and Gul'dan were just leaving through the portal as I arrived... and I... I know I won't be able to defeat them. I'll hold open the portal as long as I can. It will be up to you to strike the killing blow. Our fate is in your hands, George. 
Complete 2 bonus objective areas within Tanaan Jungle.	Pressing the Attack	We got Gul'dan's minions on the run, commander! If you be feelin' it, we should put some pressure on some of his other strongholds as well. 
Slay Wing-Guard Kuuan in Veil Shadar.	Kura's Vengeance	I was a wing-guard myself, once upon a time. One afternoon, I was caught away from my post. I just wanted an hour to watch the festival... Kuuan was supposed to cover for me, but instead he sold me out to gain favor with our superiors. They plucked my eyes, broke my wings, and threw me off the spire. Yet I am the fortunate one, for if Iskar hadn't found me, I'd have died there. And now Kuuan shows his face in Veil Shadar on the same day that you show up willing to kill for coin. Fortunate, indeed. 
Destroy the Iron Horde in Karabor.	The Defense of Karabor	Defend Karabor from the Iron Horde. At the end of the northern courtyard is Arnokk the Burner. He guards the entrance to the harbor behind Karabor, where the main Iron Horde army is waiting. Once we've taken care of him, we'll need to deal with the Iron Horde leader, Commander Vorka. 
Collect ingredients in Gloomshade Grove.	Gloomshade Game Hunter	<You find a list on a piece of parchment. Arsenio needs some ingredients for a new recipe he's preparing at your garrison.> 
Revive 6 Injured Crewmen.	Getting the Crew Back Together	Oh wow, the debris is all over the mountainside! The survivors won't make it if we don't do something quick. They need healing NOW! Here, take my bandages and go patch them up. 
Confront Grotan the Herald.	Let the Hunt Begin!	I have no time for my brother's whimpering. We hunt for vengeance or death. The Thunderlord chieftain slew my father and left me for dead, so I shall take his three sons, the first of which is this runt in my hand. This filth has revealed the number and positions of the Thunderlords in the ravine beyond. Join us, if you dare, and you will witness how real warriors of the Frostwolf clan fight. Get in my way, and I will end you. 
Drink the Clarity Elixir and witness the fate of Karabor.	The Fate of Karabor	Threads of the future weave together, winding and unwinding, creating tapestries that change in form and color from one moment to the next. I must have clarity. I must focus on the ONE strand that will become reality. When you are ready to share in my vision, drink the elixir. When the vision begins, be on your guard. The events of the vision are as deadly as anything we experience in this reality. 
Find Merreck Vonder in your Shipyard and complete a Naval Mission.	Naval Commander	We have come a long way in a short time on this shipyard, George. Now it's time to run our first naval mission and control the seas of Draenor! I will need to setup shop from a high vantage point to plan out these seafaring missions. Meet me near the shipyard entrance and we can get started. 
	The Razorbloom	 
Kill Quakefist.	Quakefist	I'm getting reports of a giant in the forest. A few of the Karabor peacekeepers have followed it to a cave. In all honesty I don't think any of our troops are willing to engage the beast. Maybe you could investigate? I'm sure the peacekeepers would appreciate the help. 
Rescue gladiators Bruto, Y'kish, and Pitfighter Vaandaam.	Getting Gladiators	When we fled Stonemaul, we had to leave others behind. If we try to rescue them and are recognized, the ogres will know our purpose, and the first thing they will do is kill our friends. The ogres do not know you, which might give you a fighting chance. Enter Stonemaul, find the other gladiators, and release them from their bonds. Do this and you will have our loyalty. 
	The Writhing Mire	 
Fly upon Ka'alu and kill 80 Adherents.	When All Is Aligned	The ravenspeaker acolytes have been equipped with Apexis interfaces, they just need to get close enough. Come, let us take to the skies and secure the Terrace of Dawn. When all is aligned, we shall turn the false suns against one another and the spires shall burn like torches! I look forward to penning your actions into history. 
Defeat Captain Brak and find the Heart of the Magnaron.	Chains of Iron	The artifact we seek is within our grasp. Be prepared for a fight. If they truly have learned how to control gronn, this may be more difficult than I anticipated. I will join you in this battle as soon as you arrive. 
Slay Dorogg the Ruthless.	The Butcher of Bladespire	After Ga'nar advanced into the fortress, the Bladespire unleashed a giant creature on our forces. I am still weak after using my magic, but at least I can help this orc in her recovery. Help take Dorogg down, George. 
Speak to Magister Serena at Fort Wrynn.	Due Cause to Celebrate	Shall we return to your outpost? It would be a much better - and safer - place to celebrate. I'll teleport us there. 
Use the Drafting Table to choose between the construction of a Corral or a Tankworks.	A Choice to Make	We're ready to start building. All that we need is for you to make a choice. The blueprints are on the drafting table. Take a look. Then, let me know if we're going to construct a corral or a tankworks. 
Carry charged resonance crystals to the primary, secondary, and tertiary pylons.	Invisible Ramparts	Exarch Akama is too cautious, but we shouldn't ignore a threat from the Shadowmoon clan. It is good you are here! Since we arrived on Draenor I have dedicated myself to recreating the technology we left behind. This large structure here is a defense ward. It should counter a Shadowmoon advance - provided we power it up. I have prepared resonance crystals at my workshop to the south. Carry one crystal at a time to the three pylons that surround the ward, then activate the control panel nearby! 
Defeat Demolitionist Megacharge in Darktide Roost and take his explosives cookbook.	Treasure Contract: Explosive Discoveries	In Shadowmoon Valley there is a cave said to possess an ancient tome that may contain secrets that can help our cause against the Iron Horde. The cave, however, is protected by an ancient barrier composed of arcane energy. There is a goblin in Darktide Roost, said to know how to take down any barrier. Persuade him to give up his secrets and bring back the book. 
Follow the clue from the journal to find Gutrek's blade.	Gutrek's Cleaver: The Final Piece	Only one piece remains. The journal reads:""The final piece, Gutrek's blade, was to be displayed in a place of honor for all time overlooking the Ring of Blood. I don't think I've seen it there myself, but it says it's supposed to be somewhere where it has a clear view of every battle."" 
Climb the chain and kill Gorr'thog.	Last Steps	In a rage, Ga'nar ascended to fight Gorr'thog, the ogre king. He is alone, and the ramp to the throne room is now blocked. You've proven resourceful. Perhaps you could find another way up? I sustained wounds on my way here, but I will work to cut my way through and up the ramp so we may rejoin. Hurry traveler, ensure that the Frostwolf clan wins our assault on the citadel. 
Find the Blademaster's Banner in a Burning Blade Locker.	Not Without My Honor	The blade is not the only important item a blademaster carries. Once he has passed his final tests in the Masters' Caverns, the blademaster is given the honor of wearing the Burning Blade's banner. When my petition to reclaim my rightful place with the clan fell upon deaf and craven ears, I was stripped of that honor. No doubt, my banner has been stored away somewhere in Hallvalor. They'll give it to some other aspiring blademaster if they don't burn it first. 
Speak to Prophet Velen at Twilight Glade.	Into Twilight	The safety of my people is of the utmost priority. It is likely that Ner'zhul has taken the prisoners to Shaz'gul, his stronghold to the southwest. I do not wish to use aggression against him, but he may force my hand. Meet me at Twilight Glade, George. Then, we shall try our best to recover the prisoners. 
	Direhoof's Hide	 
Kill Kur'ak the Binder, burn the Thunderlord Supplies, and destroy the Thunderlord Ballistae.	Leave Nothing Behind!	The Thunderlord clan has become a thorn in my side I will no longer tolerate. Go east and leave none alive! Burn their supplies! Leave them nothing to cling to. Converge on the Savage Crag to the east when it is done. 
Find and activate the first key to the Apexis device.	Amulet of Rukhmar: The First Key	The Arakkoa research points to three ""keys"" that need to be activated in order to use the Apexis device. The first is located in Skettis. The text mentioning it reads:""The first key is kept in the high reaches of upper Skettis. It lay where the dead can protect it from the talons of the unwanted."" 
Meet with Durotan in front of your garrison in Frostfire Ridge.	To the Garrison	My father is avenged. The sons of the Iron Wolf are all slain. Go to the garrison your people are constructing in the south. There, herald my return to my laggard brother. The time has come for the ""chieftain"" to be reminded of what it means to be a Frostwolf. 
Get the key from Slavemaster Turgall and find Mulverick's Axes.	Mulverick's Plight	You were sent here to free me? It seems that makes us allies. Slavemaster Turgall within the Soostained Mines will certainly have the key to this cage. While you're in there, do you think you could see which of those spineless taskmasters took my axes? 
Follow Maladaar's trail to verify that Elodor has been infiltrated.	Trust No One	Nothing is the same since I returned. There is always whispering - everywhere, whispering. Maraad cannot see it, but there are even traces of fel energy here in Elodor. We have been infiltrated! I must attend to the Exarch Council, but I need you to investigate. Follow the traces of fel energy that I will illuminate. If there are truly traitors in our midst, they will have to have some sort of hideout. Find it! I will wait for you with the other Exarchs. 
Recover the Old Gavel from Skizzik.	The Kaliri Whisperer	An important contact lives in the nearby Shadowglade. He is meek, but trains kaliri of monstrous size which are quite dangerous. He once claimed they could knock a rylak out of the sky, but I'll believe that when I see it. Skizzik is holding a valuable treasure for me. Seek him out and get him back to Veil Terokk if you can. At the very least, recover the gavel I entrusted to him. 
Collect a Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragment from any Treasure or from any Rare or Rare Elite creature in Tanaan Jungle.	Unknowable Power	The one they call Gul'dan has ruined his own people, and now seeks to ruin what remains of mine as well. The fallen outcasts at Kra'nak have already pledged themselves to Gul'dan in a false promise of a return to the skies. He has given the most powerful of his minions the power of the Apexis, but twisted in a way that I cannot explain. Bring one of these fragments to me. 
Take chalk rubbings of the northern, eastern, western, and southern Tribal Stones in the Whispering Fields.	The Dark that Blinds Us	After years of research, there is still so much I do not understand about the Shadowmoon. To the southwest are stone monuments detailing the orcs' history. I'm not able to get close enough to examine the stones, but perhaps you can. If you could take a chalk rubbing of the words written on those stones, and I will reward you handsomely. 
Construct a Destroyer in your Shipyard and send it on a naval mission.	Destroying the Competition	One battle does not win the war, Commander. That Transport isn't gonna hold up long against this Iron Horde navy. We are going to need another ship. Lucky for us, a local smuggler has supplied us with the plans we need to build Destroyers. We should construct one of these ships immediately! 
Choose to construct either a Lumber Mill or a Sparring Arena at Beastwatch.	Your Base, Your Choice	You have already constructed an impressive garrison in Frostfire. I believe I should defer this next choice to you. One region of Gorgrond is rich in resources. A lumber mill could help us make the most of them. Another region harbors hardened gladiators. A sparring arena would help persuade them to fight for our cause. Either path will strengthen us as we seek to find and weaken the Iron Horde. Which do you choose, Commander? 
Collect 9 Deathweb Fangs in Deathweb Hollow.	Antivenin	I'm worried about Nyami. She's so focused on retrieving the Heart of Auchindoun that she seems to have lost sight of everything else. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to belittle her wisdom, but look around! Every soldier we sent into the mine has been gravely injured by the deathweb spiders. Their wounds need immediate attention! Please, can you retrieve some fangs from the spiders? I can use them to create an antivenin, but I need to stay here and keep them stable until then. 
Follow the clue to find the Molten Shamanstone and receive the Blessing of Fire.	Gronnsbane: The Blessing of Fire	The weapon has been assembled, but it lacks the power that made it a legend. In order to restore it, you must receive three blessings: one of fire, one of frost, and one of beasts. The first blessing mentioned in the journal is that of fire. The journal reads:""He describes an ancient monolith, perched upon the edge of a precipice extending from the cliff where the searing magma falls into the sea. I believe the location he speaks of is just overlooking Tor'goroth's Tooth."" 
Gather 10 Shadow Dust.	A Feast of Shadows	Many arakkoa died in Veil Akraz. From the outside, all seems still. Empty. But in this place between worlds, death never goes unnoticed. Stray life essence seeps through from the other side; a feast for the beings who prowl here. Slay the shadow creatures here, and gather from their corpses the fine dust they produce. I will need much of it to perform the rites of the Talon King. 
Kill Kliaa and bring its stinger to Dyuna at Embaari Village.	WANTED: Kliaa's Stinger	Posted by: DyunaA vicious queen swamplighter has made the northern forests of Shadowmoon its home. Unfortunately, this poisonous pest terrorizes the forest between Embaari Village and Shattrath. As local traders put their lives at risk, prices of goods will continue to rise. Anyone who can put an end to the beast should detach its stinger as proof and bring it to Dyuna in Embaari Village. The merchant traders will reward generously. 
Drink the Elixir of Shadow at Ishaal's Hut in the Shadowglade.	Last of the Talonpriests	Talonpriests live among us in secret, guarding the rites of the Talon King's return. The Adherent proclamation you acquired in Skettis revealed two of them living in the Shadowglade to the north. Orcs have moved into the region, and the Adherent's beam weapon left Veil Akraz a smoking crater. As you can see, my people are beset by enemies on all sides. Talonpriest Ishaal survived and is in hiding. Drink this elixir near his hut to peer into the shadows and make contact with him. 
Defeat the Shadow Council at the Throne of Kil'jaeden in Tanaan Jungle.	Assault on the Throne of Kil'jaeden	The Shadow Council are summoning their demonic masters upon a mountain they are calling the Throne of Kil'jaeden. Make no mistake; This is the most dangerous region in Tanaan. Gather together a war party and assault the Throne of Kil'jaeden before the Legion gains a foothold here! 
Help Ga'nar win his vengeance.	The Eldest	There is Hatock, last and eldest son of the Iron Wolf. One of the greatest hunters the Thunderlord have ever fielded. He was there when his father murdered my father and left me for dead. When I am done with him he will regret not finishing the job. 
Speak with Yrel in Gorgrond.	Hero's Call: Gorgrond!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Yrel in Gorgrond. Yrel and Maraad are requesting for a small expedition to be sent into the wilds of Gorgrond. We hope to gain a better understanding of the land in hopes that it will show us how to exploit weaknesses in the Iron Horde. Assist them with their expedition. Glory to the Alliance! 
Return to Durotan at Bladespire Citadel.	Back to Bladespire Citadel	Durotan must be told of your vision. Pul Windcarver will offer you a flight back. The fate of the Frostwolf... of Draenor, depends upon you, George. 
Kill King Deathbloom.	Game of Thorns	<Jarrod is clearly injured. He winces in pain as he begins to talk.>My lead forest operator, Shelly... she is being held not far from here... 
Get reports from various scouts in Tanaan Jungle.	Commander in the Field!	This battle will be won, but it will be hard fought. Our rangari did manage to get a few scouts out to the rest of the jungle though. Perhaps it is best you collect this intelligence yourself and see what this jungle holds for us all. 
Help Anzu defeat Sethe in the Broken Spire.	Sethe, the Dead God	The time has come to put an end to Sethe. I killed him before, and with your help I shall do it again. Ready yourself for a fight - the cultists will not stand idly by while we stamp out their god. 
Plant the Focusing Lens atop the Exarch's Rise in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Traitor's True Name	We must give the traitor no place to hide. I have a focusing lens that will illuminate cloaked fel energy. If it were placed on a high point, it could act like a beacon, lighting up anyone in town who reeks of the fel taint. There is a prayer circle atop the Exarch's Rise to the north that will serve our purpose. Plant the focusing lens, George. If you reveal anything, deal with it. Then meet me below. 
Meet Shadow Hunter Denjai at Vol'mar in Tanaan Jungle.	I Sunk Your Battleship	Commander, we must expand our fleet if we hope to stand a chance against the Iron Horde. We have heard reports from Tanaan that a new Horde faction can supply us with the plans to build battleships. Head out there as soon as you can and investigate! 
Collect 6 Zapper Sacs from Lakebottom Zappers in Talador.	Clear!	You gotta help me fix this robot. I'm friggin' hungry! I built the Pleasure-Bot 8000 to locate Draenor truffles, and what does it do? It swims to this stupid island and shorts its power fluctuator. I got it hooked up to these batteries, but it ain't enough juice to jump it. Be a doll and get me the zapper sacs from the electric eels in the lake, would ya? They oughta be enough. 
Retrieve the Ember Blossom from the Elemental Plateau.	A Rare Bloom	Many years ago I had a life-mate, Dahaka. We were only bound a short time before she was taken from me. I have lived long, but I have never known greater pain than that day. I was young and my grief was great; the earth quaked beneath my rage. I laid her to rest upon this cliff. It is here where I too will rest, but first a favor. A rare bloom grows in a cave within the fiery, molten earth of the plateau. It was her favorite. I would lay the flower upon her grave one last time before I die. 
Take Gormaul Tower from the Bladespire ogres.	Gormaul Tower	It is time for us to strike out against those who would enslave us! We travel to Gormaul Tower to wrest it from the Bladespire ogres. I would welcome your company. Mount up, and together we will ride to battle! 
	Vileclaw's Claw	 
	Iyun Weald	 
Speak to Soulbinder Nyami at the Seat of Depravity in Gul'rok.	Into the Heart of Madness	George, Nyami ran off to 'take down Teron'gor herself.'You need to find her. She has no chance against him on her own. I must remain here and organize our ranks should another attack fall upon us. I'm counting on you. 
Speak to Morketh Bladehowl in Vol'jin's Pride.	The Only Way to Travel	Call me cautious but I kept a few flares just in case we needed to evac. I'm glad that wasn't needed but we could still use the ride back to the arsenal. Are you ready, <sir/ma'am>? 
Collect 6 Swamplighter Dust, 3 Engorged Hearts, and 1 Starflower.	The Clarity Elixir	I see a thousand glimpses of the future, swimming in a chaotic blur. It is possible to focus my energies to see the true eventuality - the future most likely to come to pass. I will need an oracle stone to focus my power, and a special elixir to still my mind. To make the elixir, I will need the following ingredients: wing dust from Swamplighters along the river, fresh hearts from a monstrously-sized hydra, and a rare star lily. Meet me at Moonwillow Peak when this task is done. 
Kill the genesaur.	Gestating Genesaur	This is bad. A genesaur is starting to sprout right here in the bloom. This is the first reported case of a genesaur being born in draenor in over three hundred years. No wonder the botani have been acting so crazy. They are bringing back bodies to fertilize that monstrosity. We have to kill it before it gets any larger. Once fully grown there is no stopping that beast. 
Follow the Wildwood Wash to Naielle's Watch.	Welcome to Gorgrond	Gorgrond is one of the most untamed landscapes in all of Draenor. Only the most skilled of rangari venture this deep into the wilds. It is their camp we are heading for. If you wish to travel ahead, it can be found down this path and to the right. Maraad and I shall follow after you momentarily. We still have some logistics to work out before we leave the landing. 
Meet Durotan.	A Song of Frost and Fire	You have rescued many of my clan from the slave pens of Tanaan. Their liberation and the destruction of the Dark Portal are more than enough for me to consider you one of us. However, you are still a stranger to our leader, Durotan. I would like to introduce you to him. 
Bring the Apexis Interface to Darkscryer Raastok in Veil Terokk.	Control is King	Apexis technology is fascinating, isn't it? Machines powered by solar energy. Energy which itself has been imbued with magic! Simply brilliant! Ah, but there's always a catch. And I think you may have found it. Bring the interface device back to Veil Terokk, will you? I'll be along shortly with the Apexis cores. If my theory is right, we may be able to turn the Adherents' own weapon against them! 
Meet up with Kimzee Pinchwhistle at the Wreck of the Mother Lode.	The Mother Lode	Hey we got ourselves a crisis here! Our zeppelin ""The Mother Lode"" crashed onto the south mountain range. It was supposed to only be on an observation mission, what could have happened? We got to get down there quick and I'm going to need your help on this. Are you with me? 
Find the Decommissioned Iron Shredder in the nearby cave and take it from Engineer Draxen.	Decommissioned Mission	Ketya Shrediron,Your new Iron Shredders are a menace to our own soldiers. Decommission the prototype and store it in the cave on Talador beach until you've worked out the kinks. I will send Engineer Draxen to work on it in the meantime.- Orgrim Doomhammer 
Speak to Firn Swiftbreeze to secure a flight to Shadow's Vigil.	Attempted Murder	Kolrigg is dyin', commander. He's been poisoned and needs an antidote before it's too late. One o' yer scouts reported seein' a Shattered Hand orc nearby not long ago - I wager that's our best shot. There's a small arakkoa camp tae the east that sits near a known Shattered Hand encampment. We should start our search there, <sir/madame>. I've already spoken to yer flight master about flyin' us out; every second counts. 
Speak with Solog to begin construction on a transport ship. Once complete, add it to your collection of ships.	Ship Shape	You want to take the fight to Gul'dan? You need a transport! Speak to me when you are ready to begin construction. 
Slay 12 Adherent Invaders in Aruuna and the Aruuna Crystal Mine.	Burning Sky	It happened so fast. A white-hot flash of light ignited the nearby woods, followed by terrible winds that swept the flames across Aruuna. Moments later, arakkoa began descending through the smoke. I need to get Melani to the Pilgrim's Road. From there we can head for Anchorite's Sojourn and the protection of the vindicators. With the arakkoa roaming the area freely, I fear we'll be run down or worse: taken by the spreading wildfires. 
Collect an Essence of the Iron Conqueror.	Essence of the Iron Conqueror	Redeem your Essence of the Iron Conqueror with Exarch Maladaar to select an armament of your choice. 
	Bladefist Hold	 
Choose which outpost structure to construct.	At Your Command	I'm glad you're here! Fort Wrynn is nearly complete. We only need to fill this last plot. Baros provided us with blueprints for two different structures that would fit this space - an Artillery Tower or an Arcane Sanctum. It's your call, commander. The plans are on the drafting table for your perusal. 
Collect 1 Riverbeast Heart, 2 Swamplighter Venom, 4 Riotvine, and 3 Moonlit Herbs.	Fiona's Solution	Gidwin was attacked by one of those plant creatures. From the looks of it, he is suffering from some kind of paralysis. I can make a cure, but I'll need some local ingredients. 
Speak with Prophet Velen near the crashed Iron Horde Ship in Shadowmoon Valley.	Step Three: Prophet!	You have arrived in Shadowmoon Valley. It is time to speak with the prophet. 
	Bergruu's Horn	 
Meet Exarch Maladaar at the cliffs east of the Altar of Sha'tar. Complete the ritual to cleanse and interrogate Hataaru's corpse.	Speaker for the Dead	This was a betrayal from within. There's no other explanation for it. None of the Exarchs trust each other now - especially me. But Othaar and Akama can damn their laws. We've got to rout out the traitor and the only way to do it is to speak to the corpse! Join me just outside the Altar of Sha'tar atop the eastern cliffs. Soulbinder Nyami and I will perform an exorcism to save Hataaru's immortal soul... and maybe learn who did this to him. Do you trust me, George? 
Destroy the ancient barrier below Socrethar's Rise and claim the Grimoire of the Nameless Void.	Dark Grimoire: Breaching the Barrier	The components have been gathered and the ""Arcane Bunker Buster"" is assembled. Hopefully, this should pack enough punch to take out the barrier. There's only one way to find out... 
Collect 6 Vials of Toad Juice.	A Grandmother's Remedy	Oh my, such a vigorous young <lad/lass>! Such a spring in your step, and such a sparkle in your eye! When you get to my age, it's all aches and pains. Luckily, I have a recipe for an unguent that would soothe my joints. I just need the ooze from the skin of belly toads in the swamp. Would you be a dear and help an old woman out? 
Destroy 5 Defiling Crystals in Deathweb Hollow.	Vile Defilers	The deathweb spiders are remarkable creatures. Their venom twists the very form of their victims. We are not the only ones privy to this information. The Shadow Council has already dispatched its warlocks to Deathweb Hollow to infuse the spiders with fel energy so that their venom turns creatures into demonic minions! We must destroy the defiling crystals to prevent all of Talador from bending to Teron'gor's will! 
	Frostbite Hollow	 
Disable the two fel spires of the Dark Portal.	Onslaught's End	""Guard Gul'dan and his Shadow Council with your lives! The portal cannot function without our prisoners' fel magic. Fail me and watch all that you hold dear turn to ash.-Grommash Hellscream.""The Iron Horde appear to be holding prisoners that are crucial to keeping the portal open. Search the nearby spires! 
Speak with Reshad in Veil Terokk.	Return to Veil Terokk	<A small note is tied to the kaliri's foot.>""Percy should have brought with him a basket of goods, assuming he didn't dump it off somewhere along the way. The contents are a token of my gratitude and an apology for the altercation with your scout. I must urge you to return to Veil Terokk so we may press forward with our plans.- Reshad "" 
Speak with Foreman Zipfizzle in your garrison, then meet with the laborers outside of Elodor.	Migrant Workers	George, more recruits arrive at your garrison every hour. We will soon run out of food. I have made contact with Exarch Akama in hopes of securing rations from Elodor, the breadbasket of this valley. He has agreed, provided we supply labor for the harvest. Everyone wins. If you agree with my plan, speak with Foreman Zipfizzle here in the courtyard - he has gathered together available laborers. Akama and I will escort them and meet you at Elodor, far to the east! 
Kill 5 Blooming Mandroga.	Rotting Riverbeasts	The botani are infecting the local riverbeasts with some kind of strange flesh-eating plant. I fear this infection could spread to our people. If you see any infested riverbeasts, kill the blooming plants that inhabit their bodies... before they kill you. 
Meet Solog Roark at the dry docks and build another Destroyer. Once the Destroyer is complete, send it on a new mission.	If At First You Fail, Try Again!	Looks like that Submarine had a bit more firepower than we thought! They used First Strike to hit us before we even saw it coming. Losing ships is a part of naval battles, Commander. Luckily, we were prepared for this exact sort of situation. Speak with Solog down at the dry docks, he should be able to help us quickly produce another Destroyer. Head back here when the ship is complete, we will have a new mission ready for you. 
Speak with Durotan at your garrison.	Return to the Pack	Part of me agrees with Karg - we COULD challenge the Iron Wolf right now. My fists clench at the mention of his name. My muscles scream for vengeance. But then, in my heart, I feel Asha. Calming me. Guiding me. I do not deserve her wisdom, but it is a gift I will not waste.<Lokra squints at the sky.>Durotan and the others will be gathering at your garrison about now. We should meet them. 
Find Dark Iron Dwarf survivors.	A Heavy Helping Hand	Burrian gave us the coordinates of the Dark Iron base. They named it Moira's Reach. But half way through buildin' it the base got infested with goren. If you head south you should come to the structure. Just look for a big ol' cannon. We will follow as soon as we get this bloody tank untangled. 
Use the Shimmershrooms to safely gather 12 Volatile Spores.	Fun with Fungus	It is our mission as rangari to explore and understand this world. Around you is the Umberfen. Many draenei lost their lives when we first discovered this place. The volatile spores burst whenever anyone approaches. But we watched... and we learned. Around the swamp you'll notice ""Shimmershrooms,"" distinguished by their orange glowcaps. Their dust will make you invisible to the volatile spores. Grab the spores - gently! - and bring them to me. We will forge this savage world into a weapon. 
	New Owner	 
Repel the Iron Horde from Shattrath.	The Battle for Shattrath	To stop the Iron Horde, we must overcome prejudice and work together, if only for this purpose. Horde, Alliance, past, present... all meaningless in the face of this enemy. We will retake Shattrath together... or die trying. 
Defeat Ketya Shrediron at Tuurem.	Engineering Her Demise	-- THE MOTHER HAS BEEN DETECTED. WARNING! WARNING! -- 
Gather 15 Congealed Blood of Sethe from Sethekk Holllow.	Hatred Undying	The blood of the dead god, Sethe, lingers in the pools here. And with it, his hatred of Rukhmar and Anzu. So strong was this hate that it animates the blood even now, eons after he was slain by his fellow gods. I need the congealed blood that holds those spiteful creatures together. There is nothing the Adherents fear more than the power of this curse - what if we could brandish it against them? 
Use torches from a forge to burn 4 body piles in Telmor.	Invasion of the Soul Eaters	<The note is scrawled hurriedly across the parchment.>Telmor is lost. The Shadow Council is dragging our fallen into piles and feeding the souls to their leader. There is blood on my hands...Please, if anyone reads this message, burn the bodies of our fallen so our enemy cannot use them.- Restalaan, Captain of the Guard 
	Gagrog's Skull	 
Follow the clue from Megacharge's Cookbook to locate some precision blasting powder.	Dark Grimoire: The First Ingredient	You will need three ingredients to make Megacharge's special ""Arcane Bunker Buster,"" which should be able to take down the barrier. The first ingredient, some precision blasting powder, should be available nearby. The book reads:""To make one, you'll first need to acquire some high grade, precision blasting powder. Here in Blackfuse Company, it's pretty easy to come by, since they use it for all of the cannons."" 
Use the Overseer's Chair to take control of the Apexis Turret and slay 20 Apexis Destroyers and 30 Adherent Sol-Shapers.	Hot Seat	<Apexis constructs are about to emerge from their ancient chambers on a warpath. The arakkoa are sure to send more sol-shapers to support them. The interface and the turret hum in soft resonance.> 
Follow the clue from the journal to find Gutrek's pommel.	Gutrek's Cleaver: The First Piece	The journal points to the location of the pieces of Gutrek's Cleaver. It reads:""The pommel was brought to the Broken Precipice, where it was to be housed in the skull of Gutrek's first kill. It looks like it was some manner of large beast that he fought in the big bone pit."" 
Find Vindicator Mo'mor in Telaar.	Mo'mor Might Know	We know the Warsong packleader that attacked the caravan is in Telaar. She has the blueprints. We don't know where she is down there, but there's one who might. Vindicator Mo'mor was last seen alive, but taken prisoner. If he's still alive, he might know where the blueprints are. 
Help Ikky hatch from the Kaliri Egg in Shadowglade.	Ikky's Egg	<Miraculously, this single egg has eluded the ravagers. A small tag has been lovingly tied around the base of the egg. It reads ""Ikky.""> 
Examine the Ancient Prism in the Aruuna Crystal Mine.	What the Draenei Found	They came here for an artifact? The miners must have found something in our crystal mine to the north. By the Light, can you imagine how powerful that thing must be, to attract them all the way here from their spires? I suppose it is in their hands now... You'd have to be crazy to go looking for it... 
Find out what happened to Shelly and the missing lumberjacks.	Lost Lumberjacks	Shelly and her crew haven't returned from Gloomshade Grove. It's been days... I hope everything is okay. 
Find Karg Bloodfury in Grom'gar.	The Strength of Our Bonds	Asha has passed, but we share a bond that cannot be severed by death. Even now, her spirit urges me onward to Grom'gar. The Iron Wolf claims our attachments make us weak... that love makes us vulnerable. He is wrong. Karg is my strength, and I his. I will free him from his chains, and together we will show the Thunderlord clan the strength of our bonds. 
Use Na'Shra's Mining Pick to collect 20 Fomic Ore.	Smeltcraft	Stranger! Thank the spirits for them sending you to me now. I am forging a blade and cannot leave it at this delicate state. But I need more ore to complete this task. Here, take my mining pick. It is crafted from the teeth and acid of the local goren and will cut through the ore of this area as if it were air. Bring me the ore and I will lend this blade to your cause. 
Cure 6 Infected Goblins.	Curing With Force	The infection is getting stronger so I made some adjustments and I'm pretty sure I have the right formula now. It should now work but it needs to have less competition with the infected blood for it to have any effect. This means you will need to weaken them before you apply the serum for it to function properly. The infection is getting more advanced and will soon be untreatable so we have this one shot to save as many as we can. 
Travel to Gordal Fortress and meet up with Miall.	Going to the Gordunni	We have a good supply of jovite now but there just isn't enough of the material in the mine to keep the artillery tower in stock for long. Down south of here there's a mountain that's just full of the stuff but there's one problem; Ogres! The Gordunni live on top of that mountain and they have begun trading the jovite to the Iron Horde. We need to go down there and secure the minerals for ourselves. I'll pack some supplies and meet you near their fortress down south. 
Locate the Spirit Forge in Earthshaker Gorge and reforge Gutrek's Cleaver.	Gutrek's Cleaver: The Spirit Forge	With the pieces recovered, all that is left is to reforge Gutrek's Cleaver. Goldspade's journal seems to indicate that the only place to do this is the location where it was initially dismantled. The journal mentions a ""Spirit Forge"" used to dismantle the blade, and that it may be located somewhere in the nearby gorge. Find the forge and use it to combine the pieces you've gathered. 
Follow the clue from the journal to find the Steamcap Mushrooms.	The Silent Skull: The Third Reagent	The final component of the elixir is a handful of Steamcap mushrooms. The journal reads:""The Crowfeeder said that they grow among the steam vents in the higher parts of the Everbloom. I have seen one such place above the northern hydra pools."" 
Stomp out the three Sethekk Ritual Circles by running over them.	Ritual Severance	I could not defeat this curse, and long ago resigned myself to rest in darkness. But the Sethekk are performing dark rituals to draw me back, slowly binding me to Sethe's will. Should they succeed, Sethe would have me draw a dark cloak across the horizon, and bathe the world in his blood. Disrupt their rituals, so that I may return with my own free will. Then, together, we shall bring an end to Sethe's return. 
Help Yrel escape from Shaz'gul.	Escape From Shaz'gul	I've failed, George...My squadron was caught by a wandering patrol. We fought fiercely, but the alarm had been raised. The rangari forced me into hiding before surrendering themselves to the enemy. They were under MY command, and they gave their lives... for what? I... I'm not sure what to do, George. We need to get out of here, but how? 
	A Centurion Without a Cause	 
	Gold Victory	 
Retrieve the Crystal-Shaper's Tools, Melani's Doll, and the Annals of Aruuna.	Pieces of Us	When the fires broke out, I took only my daughter's hand before we fled. It was the right decision, of course, but I do long for some of the things we left behind. I am an artificer, a shaper of crystals and gems. Without my tools I am just another refugee. Our town records are kept in a memory crystal in the main hall. With it, I can carry forward the knowledge and legacy of Aruuna. Also, my daughter is terrified - it would be a great comfort for her to hold her favorite doll again. 
Follow the clue from the journal to find the Shadethisle Leaves.	The Silent Skull: The First Reagent	Grinning Tolg was in the process of brewing an elixir that would allow him to communicate with the ravagers, whom the Skulltaker relies on to remain hidden. The first ingredient, the leaves of the Shadethistle plant, can be found nearby. The journal reads:""It rests in the shadows of the harsh Gorgrond sun. I saw some under standing stones near the black iron walls."" 
Become Lord of the Ring at the Ring of Blood in Nagrand.	The World Famous Ring of Blood!	Dear Unadulterated Badass,If you're reading this, you're exactly the sort of tough-as-nails champ in the making we need down at the Ring of Blood in Nagrand. You and two friends are cordially invited to fight for your lives against the toughest creatures this side of Gorgrond. It's positively brutal - and the crowd loves it! Come talk to me to start your first fight - beat four of the fiercest creatures I've got and you'll get a shot at the champ himself!-Gurgthock 
Search the Boneslag for the missing Frostwolf orcs.	Into the Boneslag	The Thunderlords took prisoners into the Boneslag? Well what are we waiting for?! We have to go after them! You look for the missing villagers - Asha and I will track Karg. 
Obtain The Swamplighter Queen's Tail for Fiona in Shadowmoon Valley.	Swamplighter Queen	It looks like those plant creatures used some kind of poison when they attacked Gidwin. It's a powerful concoction to say the least. If we are going to cure Gidwin we need one more special ingredient. This one might be a bit harder to obtain than the others. You up to the challenge, George? 
	Dekorhan's Tusk	 
Speak with Private Stomphoof at Warspear in Ashran.	Ashran Appearance	Our base on Ashran is almost complete, commander. It would be a huge show of support if you could make a trip out there and put your stamp of approval on their staging area. I can arrange a flight if you are interested. 
Collect 6 Bloodclaw Shaman Paws.	Declawing The Bloodmane	It is written in the Scroll of Sermons to ""Bite the claw that strikes you.""Take the path south from here that leads over the mountain to the Bloodmane valley in the west. There you will find those of their tribe who can use a primitive form of magic. Slay them and remove their paws. Once you have obtained a few bring them back to me in the nest so that they may be offered to the Raven Mother! 
Slay Beastmaster Torash and free Nerok in Grom'gar.	Where's My Wolf?!	My frost wolf, Nerok, was captured with me and the others. I do not know where they are keeping him, but I'll bet the so-called ""beastmaster"" who dragged us here does. He is at the beast pens nearby, boasting about his catch to the younger hunters. We'll see how he boasts with my axe in his skull. 
Speak to Shadow-Sage Iskar and convince him to let Shadow Hunter Ukambe free.	One of Our Own	Da bird-men captured me while I was gettin' da lay a da land. We been workin' on an outpost for you just round dis mountain so your will be spreadin' all over da continent. Things not be goin' well. I be needin' your assistance, commander. Can you tell dem that I mean no harm so I can be showin' you da outpost? 
Look through Gazlowe's Eye 'n' Ear.	Through the Looking Glass	Your allies sent along a goblin, Gazlowe, to advise us against the Iron Horde. Thus far, he has proven a valuable asset. He has a looking glass set up that can see a great distance and, he claims, even hear. Use this looking glass and report back what you've seen. I will stick to my standard spyglass. 
Find Lantresor of the Blade in Hallvalor.	They Call Him Lantresor of the Blade	The Burning Blade clan at Hallvalor is supplying the Warsong with weapons and warriors. We cannot let this continue. There's a young blademaster who's been exiled from the Burning Blade for many years. They call him Lantresor of the Blade. My rangari recently saw him return to Hallvalor to challenge the blademaster leadership. Instead, they clapped him in chains. Maybe he's still alive. Maybe he'll help you deal with the Burning Blade. 
	Ikky	 
Speak to Archmage Khadgar in Talador.	An Audience With The Archmage	I'm pleased to report that your Arcane Sanctum is up and running, commander! Everything is exactly as the blueprint says... except for this note Baros scrawled on the bottom. ""Don't forget to connect the sanctum to the ley line network!""Commander, I'm a foreman, not a mage. I... have absolutely no idea how to do that. We've found Archmage Khadgar and some other Kirin Tor not far from here. To the east, near the mountains. Perhaps we should ask them for a hand? 
Speak with Shade of Terokk to accept his power. Slay 25 Shattered Hand combatants, 4 Shattered Pit-Masters, and confront Kargath Bladefist.	The Avatar of Terokk	My long sleep was disturbed by dreams of the past. I cut down my old enemies again. I watched my daughter die again. You were there. I felt your presence in these dreams. And your past was revealed to me as well. Someone has woven our fates together. My people are yours to protect, and your enemies are mine to destroy. The Shattered Hand are rallied in Bladefist Hold. Left to their own, they would claim this land for the Iron Horde. Take my power, and together we shall break them. 
Slay 20 demons in Tanaan Jungle.	Demonslayer of Tanaan	Look to the north, Mechanic. The sky is turning a sickly green. Gul'dan's summoning portals are not yet at full strength, but already the stench of demon is on the wind. Slay them, George. Destroy as many beasts as you can before they find a way to Azeroth. The Temple of Sha'naar is infested, as is the Throne of Kil'jaeden, although you may find others wandering about the jungle. 
Collect an Organic Laser Apparatus from the Ebon Hunter.	The Ebon Hunter	The laser should be good to go once we get it set up, there's just one more thing I need. There's a spore walker that hunts on the delta just southeast from here. It has an apparatus on its face that can fire a powerful laser - way more powerful than what we have hooked up. I want it. We'll be mining faster than you can imagine once we get that bad boy hooked up! 
Slay 10 Echo Hunters.	Echo Hunters	I am no sorcerer, but I've picked up a few spells in my time - enough for me to pass unseen by the naked eye. Unfortunately, the vampire bats in these woods don't use their eyes. They will hear my shuffling robes and Percy's incessant clucking a mile away. Clear them away from the path, would you? 
Report to Baros Alexston at your garrison in Shadowmoon Valley.	Fast Expansion	Greetings, Commander. I am here on behalf of architect Baros Alexston. We have gathered enough resources for the next phase of expansion. He wishes to speak to you at your earliest convenience. 
Speak with Farseer Drek'Thar at the Pool of Visions to begin the ritual of vision.	Pool of Visions	A terrible storm gathers on the horizon, Mechanic. I have prepared a ritual. You must consult the pool to see what destiny holds for us all. 
Plant the Alliance banner.	For the Alliance!	We wouldn't have survived Tanaan without your strength, George. Many draenei and Alliance alike owe you a great debt. Before we departed for the Dark Portal, King Wrynn personally recommended that I place you in charge of our operations here in Draenor. After seeing you in action, I'm inclined to agree. This is your garrison to found. Plant the banner and we'll begin construction immediately, commander. 
	Stonemaul Arena	 
Seek Yrel at the Wildwood Wash in Gorgrond. Speak with your Garrison Gryphon Master or the Flight Master at Bastion Rise to fly there.	The Secrets of Gorgrond	Commander, I was dispatched to intercept you. Yrel and Maraad have landed at Wildwood Wash, the rangari base of operations for the area. Your presence is requested immediately. We keep a small feywing presence just east of here. If you speak with the flight master they should be able to provide you safe passage to the Wash. 
Defeat Roakk in the Ring of Trials.	Ring of Trials: Roakk the Zealot	The final match is at hand, George! You've decimated all of the best challengers! There's nowhere to go from here but the very top...the reigning champion of the Ring of Trials! The current champ is an arakkoa named Roakk the Zealot. Roakk is a lunatic! He says he's on some divine crusade for the sun or something. Crazy or not, he's one of the most dangerous fighters I've ever seen and has even fought in the Highmaul Coliseum! I'm not going to lie, you're probably going to die in there...good luck! 
Slay 6 Sethekk Prophets and 6 Sethekk Chosen in Sethekk Hollow.	Servants of a Dead God	Even in death, Sethe exerts influence. The Sethekk cult was born of this influence: led by a false king in service of the dead god. Silence their prophets, for they seek a future of black seas and blighted skies. Defeat their chosen champions, for they have pledged themselves to a lie. 
Find Maraad and the lost laborers and escort them back to Elodor Fields.	Circle the Wagon	One of our wagons fell behind, and disappeared somewhere in the woods to the northwest. Vindicator Maraad and several of your workers are stranded out there. Find them and bring them back! 
	Leorajh, the Enlightened	 
Go to the Iron Front and speak with Durotan.	The Battle for the West	Our base is barely built and already the Iron Horde sets up defenses against us. Still the plan worked and we fight on two fronts. I have received word that Durotan has finally breached the western gates as well, but is bogged down in a pitched battle. You should go see the situation for yourself. 
Speak with Azik in Spires of Arak.	Arakkoa Exodus	I assume you're familiar with the arakkoa, commander? Great, flying birdfolk. Extremely territorial. Some, however, have withered wings - a disease, maybe. They seem to be outcast from arakkoa society. You find them now and then, squatting in forgotten ruins or peddling trinkets on the roadside. It seems the Iron Horde has incited the arakkoa by moving into their lands, and the outcasts are fleeing in droves. We should make contact with these outcasts - they could have valuable information. 
Meet Exarch Maladaar at Light's Rest in Talador.	Light's Rest	With the brute force of our enemy neutralized, we must turn our sights on quelling the aftermath and preparing for any future assaults. We still need Auchindoun's defenses reinvigorated. Meet me at Light's Rest, not far south of here. We have reports coming in of demonic taint in the area, and we may be able to track down the remaining power crystal shards at its source. 
Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Ancient Branch	This branch is proof of your strength at slaying ancients and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the branch back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
Speak with Rangari D'kaan at Telaari Station.	The Might of the Warsong	<The officer is in a great deal of pain. It's clear that he's not long for this world.>The Warsong. Surprise attack. Headed... west.<He takes a moment, before continuing.>They took the... blueprints....<These are his last words.> 
Follow Archmage Khadgar and speak with Magister Serena in Zangarra.	Making Acquaintances	It's nice to see someone else taking a vested interest in the arcane arts, you know. It's all too rare these days if you ask me. Unfortunately, I must meet Cordana to handle an important matter, but we're in luck! One of my good friends in the Kirin Tor has agreed to help you connect your arcane sanctum to the ley line network. She's waiting at my tower. Let's leave immediately and introduce you to one another. 
Catch up with Lokra in the Icewind Drifts.	Moving Target	Karg's captors are moving east - probably retreating to Grom'gar with their tails between their legs! They think they outrun me, but Asha here is the fastest thing on four legs. We'll run them down in the Icewind Drifts. 
Destroy the Thunderlord Cache, Blackrock Forge, and Munitions Landing.	Gazlowe's Solution	I've identified some high value targets down in the forest below. When you get near one, you can deploy my solution. Deploy it and the objectives will be neutralized with great ceremony. 
Kill Greyseer and 6 Pale orcs.	The Pale Threat	If we are to succeed in stopping Cho'gall from destroying the naaru, we will need to fight our way through the Underpale; a dark, winding cavern infested with the Pale. The Pale are fallen orcs that despise all that is good and holy. The longer they are left to their devices beneath the ground, the further their dark plots progress. Make your way into the Underpale, slay the vile creatures within and take out their leader, Greyseer. 
	Bloodmane Pridelands	 
	Xelganak's Stinger	 
Speak to Bron Skyhorn to secure a flight to Talador.	It's a Matter of Strategy	**Eyes Only -- Commander George**The Iron Horde have proved themselves worthy foes. They managed to get their fleet moving to Talador from Gorgrond without my spies seeing a thing. Talador be a crossroads for the whole continent. We can't let them have it. Don't worry boss, we got a plan. Foreman Grobash be setting up an outpost for our forces as we speak. They be ready for you when you arrive, commander.--Rokhan 
Defeat Vindicator Dalu and Soulbinder Halaari in combat.	Gatekeepers of Auchindoun	I was taken captive by the Iron Horde when they raided our caravan en route to Auchindoun. I escaped, but these spirits won't let me through to join my fellow Sunsworn until someone defeats them in combat! Please, will you help me defeat them? 
Speak to Bodrick Grey at your garrison in Shadowmoon Valley.	News from Talador	Bodrick Grey sends word from your garrison that they have spotted a fleet of Iron Horde at the shores of Talador. We must not allow them to destroy Shattrath. 
Kill Xanatos the Defiler in Deathweb Hollow and retrieve Sha'tari.	Into the Hollow	I've learned that the Shadow Council is using the nearby deathweb spiders' venom to spread fel corruption and augment their forces after their defeat at the Burning Front. One of my soulbinders saw a dreadlord headed into the eastern mines with Sha'tari, one of the remaining pieces of the Heart of Auchindoun. I need you to wrest Sha'tari from the dreadlord's quivering corpse and bring it to me, champion. 
Collect 25 Goren Crystals from Longtooth Gorgers.	The Crystal Shard	I'm glad you arrived when you did. The Laughing Skull orcs practice some strange spirit magic, but one of their traditions could be quite useful in our situation. While I make preparations, can you gather the reagents? First, we'll need crystals from the husks of goren corpses. You can find their bodies in the canyon. 
Obtain an Essence of the Iron Vanquisher.	Essence of the Iron Vanquisher	Redeem your Essence of the Iron Vanquisher with Lady Liadrin to select a Vanquisher armament of your choice. 
	Aogexon's Fang	 
Kill 4 Shattered Sightless, 3 Shattered Harvesters, and 1 Shattered Blood-Singer.	Extrinsic Motivation	The Shattered Hand aren't strangers to pain. They each cut off their own hand as a sign of their allegiance to Kargath. If you're going to get them to talk, it might take more than my poison. Slaughter them all. We'll see how far they're willing to go for their beloved warlord. 
Find and activate the second key to the Apexis device.	Amulet of Rukhmar: The Second Key	The first point has been activated and two more remain. The second location is hinted at in the old outcast writing:""Beneath the third fall of the great Skettis river lay the second key. May the ever-rushing waters sweep away those that might seek it."" 
Recover the Will of the Genesaur.	Will of the Genesaur	I am pretty sure those dwarves took the artifact in that iron fort there. Are you going to go get it? 
Speak to Rangari Erdanii at Affliction Ridge.	Rage and Wisdom	An endless war wages between the creatures of the eastern wilds and the beasts of the western wasteland. Should one side overwhelm the other, all of Draenor would fall at the hand of the victor. I sent Rangari Erdanii to the heart of the battle between these two forces. It is likely that she will need your help, commander. 
Find Restalaan in Telmor.	Restalaan, Captain of the Guard	They killed Aedraa and took the crystal from her! The captain of the guard, Restalaan, tried to stop them and they took him into the cathedral! If we can just get this crystal, we can reunite the Heart of Auchindoun and turn its defenses on fully! We can't afford to fail now. George, you're the only one left that can do it. You have to find Restalaan! He'll know where they took it. 
Use the goren disguise to explore locations in Gorgrond.	What's Under There?	It is done. With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the goren freely, but you can move as they do. Your travels through the canyon are now made easier. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach. Perhaps these tunnels will lead to more information that could be used against the Iron Horde. 
Defeat Dreadpiston.	Dreadpiston	The Iron Horde overtook a peaceful draenei outpost without mercy. They used a machine they call Dreadpiston to level the town in minutes. Destroy it. 
Defeat O'mogg Blackheart and retrieve Karab'uun in the Burning Front.	The Heart of Auchindoun	A band of Shadow Council orcs stole the Heart of Auchindoun! The Heart powers all of Auchindoun's defenses. Thankfully we were able to save its core and one of its four pieces. The warlock O'mogg Blackheart is using Karab'uun, one of the stolen pieces, to power the largest portal in the Burning Front. Return Karab'uun to me. 
	Kaz the Shrieker	 
Kill Hilaani and bring the Pile of Riverbeast Meat to Patrick Messer.	WANTED: Hilaani	O'riley wants to thank our peasants for their hard work with a riverbeast dinner.$I don't want to waste your time asking you to slaughter the things all day, commander. We've gotten reports of a huge riverbeast called Hilaani that would feed the whole fort twice over living in the lake to the south. If you have a chance to bring cuts of her meat back, the men would be grateful. 
	A Rare Find	 
Place 5 G-X3 Telemetry Beacons.	Infrastructure Improvements	<Sir/Ma'am>, we built a vehicle to take ya up to the Throne of Kil'jaeden but whenever we try a test flight the navigation system goes crazy! In my expert opinion it's 'cause of that crazy demon magic the Iron Horde is playing around with up there. If you could travel up there and place these telemetry beacons we can program the vehicle and give you a stable flight all the way up. Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious! 
Help High Ravenspeaker Krikka with the ritual of calling.	Call of the Raven Mother	All is now in its place to begin the ritual of calling that will bring the Raven Mother back to the nest. You have fulfilled all of the tests we have put before you so it is only fitting that you join with us and participate in the ritual. Soon the Raven Mother herself will appear before us! Oh my feathers are tingling in excitement! Speak to me again when you are ready. 
Find Corporal Thukmar and recover his intel.	Leave Every Soldier Behind	Hmmm. The ogron possess something of value to the Iron Horde. I'm sure they're unaware, likely just bored and in need of something to torture. I'd be inclined to just let them be, it's a fate they deserve. But we can't afford not to follow up on this clue. With any luck, it will help us stop the Iron Horde from turning Gorgrond's most fearsome creatures into weapons. Try to find this Corporal Thukmar and his notes. We'll meet you there. 
Follow the clue from the journal to find Gutrek's hilt.	Gutrek's Cleaver: The Second Piece	The search for Gutrek's Cleaver continues. The journal reads:""The hilt was to be buried in the marshlands, among the serpents whose poison claimed Gutrek's life. There's something here about covering it with a spiral stone, which is supposed to keep Gutrek's spirit at bay somehow."" 
Cure 5 Frostwolf Gladiators.	The Cure	Cowards! A curse on these wretched meatbags! The Bladespire have always taunted the orc clans by taking our wounded as slaves to fight like dogs in their pits. In retaliation for our assault they have poisoned their orc prisoners, leaving them to suffer and die an excruciating death. Only their geomancers carry the antidote, traveler. Use it to cure the Frostwolf prisoners. 
Destroy the Essence of Shadow, Essence of Darkness, and Essence of Anguish.	Harbingers of the Void	Our scouts have made a horrifying discovery, George. The souls of the prisoners are being used to summon creatures from the void. Inside, three beings of darkness already await - the Essence of Shadow, the Essence of Darkness, and the Essence of Anguish. They must be destroyed immediately, before their power can be unleashed. 
Ride the Frostwolf Rylak to Wor'gol.	Den of Wolves	Durotan wishes for us to join him now that you have established your foothold. I hope he will accept your help. 
Find Kral'za.	Forbidden Love	My son, Kral'za, is beyond stubborn. After we split from the Shadowmoon Clan he refused to let go of his relationship with a young Shadowmoon orc. I forbid him to see her anymore. He ran off earlier today and has not returned. I don't trust Dol'mak. Like the other Shadowmoon orcs she continues to dabble in the void. 
Find Frenna within Tangleheart.	Lost Lumberjack	Me friend was in the mole machine wit' me. Good ol' Frenna tried to make the best of it by writin' all o' her observations down in a journal. Penny here wants me to tell ya where she is. I cannae say for sure, but she was followin' me outta here and I don't think she made it. 
Talk to Rexxar and vouch for Rangari Erdanii.	Is This One of Yours?	I found this one skulking nearby. She claims to be an ally of yours. Is this true? Or does she cook slowly over my fire? 
Speak to Ahm at Archenon Siegeyard.	Dying Wish	This appears to be an ancient Draenei heirloom. Blood stains on it would indicate that it was taken from its owner by force. An inscription on the back says ""Ahm,"" which is likely its rightful owner. 
Find 20 Manual Pages at Archenon Siegeyard.	Vol. X Pages ?	The manual for the shredder was wedged in there, but it's missing lots of pages. We need to find as many pages of that manual as possible and I might--MIGHT--be able to get this shredder operational. Based on the direction of the wind, I bet the pages flew toward Archenon Siegeyard. 
Slay 15 demons in the Burning Front.	Holding the Line	Auchindoun is under attack! The Auchenai are valiant warriors in their own right, but they cannot hold against these endless demon hordes alone. We came here to stop the Legion from engulfing Draenor... working together is our best shot. I need you to thin out the demons' numbers so we can regroup our forces safely and push forward into the Burning Front. We will stop their march here and now! 
	Thek'talon's Talon	 
Kill 8 Grumplings.	Menacing Grumplings	The grumplings are horrid creatures. They're the ones doin' the dirty work for Grumpus. If you're able to remove the threat I'm sure rescuing the children won't be much of a problem. 
Speak with Gar'rok.	The Debt We Share	These mortal shells that we call bodies are not ours to keep. The body is a gift of earth that must one day be returned from whence it came. The time has come for this body to return to the elements. Know that you have lifted the weight from an old heart, George. As I pass on from this realm, I do so without regret. I have fought on behalf of my people and my land, I have served the elements, and I have loved. It would honor me if you would stay during these final moments, Mechanic. 
Kill 8 Ogron Spinecrushers and Borogahn.	Fair Warning	The ogron here are far from brilliant, but they are more intelligent than the gronn. They're large, and even stronger than they look. Their leader, Borogahn, is especially formidable. Despite several fights, I have not yet managed to kill him. Heed my words, friend. Take caution as you explore their lair. Nisha is ready to move. Ask her to take you to the mouth of the cave, and I'm sure she would be happy to. 
Speak to Rulkan at Exile's Rise.	Chasing Shadows	Not all of the Shadowmoon orcs followed Ner'zhul's alliance with the Iron Horde. Among them, there is one orc whom I befriended many years ago. She may be able to tell us more about Ner'zhul's plans for this ""Dark Star.""She can be found at Exile's Rise to the northeast. I will send word ahead so she expects your arrival. 
	Mu'gra's Head	 
	A Fel Puppy Of My Own	 
Learn the blueprints and destroy the evidence.	Shipbuilding	The first thing we need to start building ships is a blueprint. With your help, I grabbed some of the best ones from the Iron Docks before we broke out of there. Let's make sure these don't fall back into the hands of the Iron Horde. Memorize these blueprints, Mechanic, and then destroy the evidence. Let me know when you are done. 
Slay the Voice of Iyu.	The Voice of Iyu	The botani and their wretched minions take and take and take. They want food, they take our land. They want an army, they take our people. It is important to strike fear into the shrubby hearts of these plant people. Look for their leader, the Voice of Iyu. It is a botani who speaks on behalf of their genesaur master. Kill their precious leader in the safety of his precious bloom. 
Defeat Iyu.	Iyu	Did ya hear that? Sounds like that genesaur wants its 'will' back. I told ya this place is nuthin' but bad luck. I'll git that shot ya gave me loaded properly and see if I can't weaken that thing up. You better get up there and deal with it though... 
Kill 10 Spore Drifters or Fungal Hulks in Sporemist Shallows.	Unwanted Pests	Those creatures out in the shallows keep busting the turrets as fast as we can get them operational. I'm supposed to go clear them out but my blaster is completely busted; the damn thing barely can light a candle like this! Could you do me a favor and go kill a few of those pests while I get my blaster fixed at the shop? Just let Gazwitz know you covered for me so I can get reimbursed for the repair. 
Speak to Dungar Longdrink to secure a flight to Talador.	The Critical Path	The auburn forests of Talador sit at a critical crossroads of this continent, commander. The Iron Horde's fleet is already en route from Gorgrond to Shattrath on the west coast. Talador will fall if we don't reinforce them. I took the liberty of dispatching Foreman Eksos, who has already begun construction on an outpost for your forces not far from the Iron Horde landing point. He awaits your orders sir. 
Kill 15 Shadowmoon Darkcasters or Shadowmoon Voidclaws.	On the Offensive	We cannot enter these gates, but you can, Mechanic. Your mission is critical, and the Shadowmoon will kill you on sight. Do not hesitate to return the favor. 
Kill Skog.	The Den of Skog	So this gronn infestation ain't gonna solve itself. You're gonna have to show them who's boss, Horde style! With this many gronnlings around there is bound to be a full grown, big mama of a gronn. Find him... it... her... or whatever, and take it out, and the rest of those gronnlings might lose interest in our little operation here. 
Follow the clue in the journal to find Koros Soulsplinter. Defeat him and claim the Smooth Crystal Shard.	Dream of Argus: The Final Fragment	The last orc to be found was a hermit who kept away from the bulk of the Shadowmoon orcs at the Pillars of Fate camp, but was often seen in the high hills above. The journal reads:""It is said, however, that he can often be seen among the graves upon the high hill, overlooking the camp below. There he would commune with the dead ancestors, whom it is said he preferred over his living brethren."" 
Find Bazwix's stolen treasure.	My Precious!	You've got to help me! I was hiding on the trade wagon that got ambushed just down the road from here. I snuck away before the saberon spotted me...but...but...THEY STOLE MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION! You've got to help me get it back! I watched them drag it into Sabermaw and up that giant hill! Who knows what those filthy saberon will do to it! Please, I'm just a kid! You've got to help me out, right? 
	Tangleheart	 
	Three Feet Under	 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	The Rise and Fall of Barov Industries: Weldon Barov	[PHYLARCH ACQUISITION TEXT GOES HERE] 
Speak to Farseer Drek'Thar in Frostfire Ridge.	Warchief's Command: Frostfire Ridge!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Farseer Drek'Thar in Frostfire Ridge. The destruction of the Dark Portal has stopped the Iron Horde invasion of Azeroth, but now we must to take the fight to them. With Farseer Drek'Thar's aid, we will be able to establish a strategic position in Draenor to fight against our enemies. For the Horde! 
Use Blackrock Blasting Powder to destroy 5 Iron Horde Cannons in Grom'gar.	Enfilade	If we leave now, my clan's final assault on Grom'gar will be a disaster. Though our warriors are unmatched in melee, the Thunderlords have new ranged weapons - our forces would be decimated as they cross the Icewind Drifts. But WE are already here. We can overtake those weapons before they ever fire. Blackrock orcs help our enemies forge these ""cannons"" in the workshops on the south side. If we use their own tools to sabotage the weapons, we leave Grom'gar wide open to a Frostwolf raid. 
Recover the Telmor Registry, the Auchenai Prayerbook, and Leafshadow in Telmor.	Never Forget	We had to escape Telmor with what few we could save. Someone disabled Leafshadow's cloaking field; I know not who, but I suspect it had to have been one of our own. We will retrieve our livelihoods in time, but we cannot risk losing our sacred artifacts. If you are able, bring Leafshadow, our town registry, and our prayerbook to safety. 
Deliver the Crate of Northshire Port to Dusk-Seer Irizzar.	Peace Offering	We could really use an ally to trade with, commander. There's an arakkoa outcast living in the middle of a ravager nest northeast of here... do you think he might ally with us? He must have some sort of secret to keeping those ravagers at bay. I have one last crate of my Northshire Port. Maybe that will help convince him that we're friendly. 
	Evermorn Springs	 
Collect 6 Wind Serpent Wings.	Sons of Sethe	Many years have passed since anyone has been in contact with Anzu. He faded away, as Terokk did, to take refuge in the shadows. If we are to coax him back, we should make an offering. Sethe took the sky from us all - it seems fitting to take the wings of his children. 
Collect 25 Goren Crystals from Longtooth Gorgers.	What the Bony Xuk?	Good to see your bones are still intact, George. Xuk's too. When you set off into the heart of the canyon, Xuk came to offer my services. Xuk not letting you take all of the skulls! Xuk will share with you powerful spirit magics my clan has passed down for many generations. While Xuk make preparations, you must gather the reagents. First, we'll need crystals from husks of goren corpses. You can find their bodies in the canyon. 
Speak to Sylene at Twilight Glade to gain an orc illusion, then plant explosives at key locations in Shaz'gul. If you lose your disguise, use Sylene's Amulet of Illusion to regain an orc appearance.	Going Undercover	Yrel leads my rangers on a search for the prisoners at the Shadowmoon village. Their work is extremely dangerous, so I need you to carry out a contingency mission. Sylene has mastered an illusion spell which will allow you to infiltrate Shaz'gul safely. Speak to her to disguise yourself. Then, plant explosives at the quartermaster's depot, the main lodge, and the ritual altar. In case anything goes wrong, set them off to create a distraction. 
Find Fiona's Caravan in Shadowmoon Valley.	Crippled Caravan	I'm getting reports that the botani have started leaving their bloom and attacking wandering travelers. This is most unusual. We already dispatched a number of rangari to try and resolve this issue. A caravan from Azeroth passed through here recently, you should probably check on your people to ensure their safety.

Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Alliance: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of man. Conquer our enemy and be known as manslayer. Fail and be nothing. 
	Sealing Fate: Apexis Crystals	 
Find Kash'drakor near the Stonemaul Arena in Gorgrond.	A Rediscovered Legend	If your troops are going to learn to fight people you better get people to fight! And they better be good. Ever hear of Kash'drakor? He's a big famous Frostwolf orc warrior type that tried to kill us Skulls. He would have won too, if the ogres hadn't snatched him. To the north is the Stonemaul Arena where they took him and a bunch of other big bad mean fighter gladiators. If you can find a way to free them, they could be the best trainers you could hope for. 
Help Deceptia	This Is Not a Quest	We need help! But not from you... 
Kill 20 Shadow Council orcs at Gul'var.	Cleaning Up Gul'var	Just because we need to focus on Gul'dan doesn't mean we're not going to take down the Shadow Council in the process. This village is filthy with Shadow Council villains. Let's do something about them. 
Meet Thaelin Darkanvil at the Wildwood Wash.	I Drew Aggro...culture	$p? Boy am I glad to see ya. I was tryin' ta ditch that genesaur when I stumbled across this rangari camp.

Save Rastaak, Ariaana, and Hakaam.	Think of the Children!	When the Shadowmoon attacked Arbor Glen, everything was thrown into chaos. Many of us escaped, but there are still three children missing. I believe they are still back in the village. Please save them! 
Speak with Durotan at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Power of the Genesaur	Commander, you now have the Will of the Genesaur along with the genesis water and enough seeds to grow an army. Not to mention the Laughing Skulls you helped save. I would call this mission a success. I will investigate this fortress further and see if there are more materials we might glean from it. In the meantime, you may want to bring these artifacts you have obtained to Durotan back at the outpost. I will catch up once we have finished here. 
Speak with Stone Guard Brox at the caravan in Nagrand.	Taking the Fight to Nagrand	Boss-mon, good to see ya. Durotan recommended dat we be gettin' a foothold in Nagrand, so I taken the liberty of dispatchin' some of da boys. Thrall's already reportin' that the outside be nearly complete.

Test the effects of a Honed Crystal, a Polished Crystal and a Harmonic Crystal in Aruuna.	Barum's Notes	<This hefty tome contains notes on the refining and shaping of Draenor's natural gems and crystals, including several full-page technical diagrams depicting complex cut patterns. The most recent pages detail a series of cuts intended to aid the draenei vindicators in battle.>""...honed to a fine edge, the material can expose weaknesses...""""when rounded and polished to such a degree, it wards off harmful...""""...this incredible discovery that a crystal can be attuned to the bearer's vitality!"" 
Meet Thaelin Darkanvil at Deeproot.	Deeproot	Since yer all set up to take on trees and bushes now, I need ta ask for a favor. I came to Gorgrond in search of an expedition of me fellow Dark Irons that were headed this way. Sadly I lost 'em. I am goin' south to look for them. Thing is, south is nothing but botani, podlings, giant trees, and other mean, angry plants. Yer lumber camp resources would be mighty appreciated. If ya help me look for me friends I swear we'll help ya in any way we can. 
Kill the Horrific Aberration in the basement of the inn.	A Piece of the Puzzle	I... I remember now. Watch Commander Branson told us to stay in the inn... he said we would be safe here. Then...Then that THING broke through and slaughtered everyone! The last thing I remember seeing was it descending into the larder. 
Speak to Prophet Velen at Anguish Fortress.	Darkest Night	This keystone will grant its bearer entry into Anguish Fortress. Take it and meet Prophet Velen outside the Shadowmoon fortress. He intends to face Ner'zhul head-on. 
Call artillery strikes on the Gordunni Boulderthrower encampments within Gordal Fortress.	Dropping Bombs	The Gordunni have only a single path to their fortress and it is well-defended from a large attack. Thankfully they wont be expecting just the two of us to be attempting to break in. This is a great opportunity to take out their defenses and get some target practice for our artillery gunners back at the arsenal. Take these smoke grenades and use it to call in an artillery strike on their catapults as we head up. 
Give weapons to 10 Frostwolf Slaves.	Armed and Dangerous	Ligra was sent with extra weapons to equip enslaved Frostwolves. Arm the Frostwolf Slaves so they can cut their way from their slavers. 
Bring the Eye of Anzu to Talon Guard Kurekk in Talon Watch. Speak with Skytalon Meshaal for a flight.	Talon Watch	By now you must be wondering about all of this curse business. What could distort a majestic arakkoa into... well, into this?<Reshad drags a crooked hand through the mottled feathers about his face.>A raven is prepped and waiting to fly you to Talon Watch. There shall your eyes be opened to the origin of this curse. Present the Eye of Anzu to Talon Guard Kurekk. He will guide you from there. 
Use the G-14 Buster Rocket near Broken Shredders to retrieve Serviceable Gears.	The Right Parts for the Job	Uncle Krixel's a tough one but he won't be going anywhere on foot with his leg broken. He has a flying machine he brought from Azeroth that can fly us out of here. Problem is, the engine's busted. I'll need some parts to fix the thing. My car's wasted but those broken shredders just outside of town should have what we need. We don't have time to break them down by hand so just use this rocket launcher and blow 'em apart. Anything that survives the blast should be strong enough to use on the engine. 
Clear the goren tunnel and use it to meet with Rexxar outside the Fissure of Fury.	A Great Escape	A goren tunnel! Once the cap is cleared, it's certain to lead outside of this Light-forsaken pit.

	Vignette: The Egg of Varasha	 
Collect the Heart of Fernus from Fernus.	Have a Heart	Did you notice the magical barrier protecting the cave's entrance? It's being powered by demon crystals. The Burning Legion has a habit of making demon parts serve as the keys to such devices. Travel west to the Ruins of Ata'gar. Look for a powerful demon therein and bring me its heart. I'll project an image of myself into the ruins. You won't have to come back here until we're done. 
Slay Grumpus.	Grumpus	One of Draenor's oldest stories is the legend of Grumpus. The story tells of a mean-spirited brute that would come in the night, in the dead of winter, and kidnap children that misbehaved. Back at his lair, he would present them with awful toys, and use their tears to spawn his minions. But Grumpus is no legend, he's real and he's taken our children! Please, you have to slay him! 
Find the 5 Hidden Rangari.	Rangari Roundup	You have a keen eye, Mechanic. There are Rangari like myself hidden throughout the Nightmarsh. I need reports from each of them to ensure the area is safe. Perhaps you can help me?

Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Gronn Eye	This eye is proof of your strength at slaying ogron and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the eye back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
Collect 20 Vials of Fel Blood from fel orcs throughout Tanaan Jungle.	Blood of Fallen Brothers	Orcs that drink Gul'dan's poison turn into fel beasts. Soulless savages. Lady Liadrin an' the Blood Knights think maybe there be a way back. They be wantin' samples of blood from freshly turned orcs. Get their blood, George! You be findin' fel orcs all over Tanaan, but the Iron Front, the Fel Forge, and the Throne of Kil'jaeden is where you find the most. 
Speak to Morketh Bladehowl inside of Vol'jin's Pride in Talador.	Unleashed Steel	Thank you... boss. I won't let you down! I didn't even try to sneak one of those low quality blades here that one of your peons placed right next to the cage. Which by the way was a pretty terrible idea and that thing should be moved before you get anyone less honorable in here. Enough talk, lets check this place out! 
Loot the Adherent Proclamation from Sun-Sage Rathyx.	Orders From On High	The Adherents of Rukhmar are the ruling body atop the spires. Their influence is absolute. Their proclamations taken as the will of Rukhmar Herself. The herald leading this purge is surely carrying out such orders - likely no more than a list of names and places they plan to erase. That list would prove invaluable in the days to come. Acquire it for me, and shut that herald up! 
	Zangarra	 
Kill 6 Spore Shamblers in Pinchwhistle Point.	Sporicide	It's revolting, absolutely disgusting, infuriating even! I'm talking about seeing those spore creatures walking around Pinchwhistle Point. While I'm working on the machine here how about you go out and kill off some of those spore creatures? I'll feel a bit better knowing there are less of those things moving around. 
Slay 7 Bloom Weavers.	Bushwhacker	We are continuing the search for Thaelin's people, but these botani, they are a larger threat than we ever realized. To infest their victims... monstrous. Please, commander, if you find yourself in Evermorn Springs to our west, slay as many of those creatures as you can. Stop them from committing such acts of horror. Bring them to justice. 
Obtain 3 Shadow Council Spellbooks and burn them in the fire by Kor'thos Dawnfury in Gul'rok.	Book Burning	Please, George... I don't have much time. The Shadow Council have allowed themselves to be turned into demons by Teron'gor and his warlocks! I have reason to believe that the shadowborne dementors are using spells given to them by Gul'dan to empower the demonic orcs. Take their spellbooks and cast them into the fire by me... it will be a pleasant sight to die to. 
Obtain 6 samples of Goren Gas from Glowgullet Shardshedders and Glowgullet Devourers within Kuuro's Claim.	Gas Guzzlers	<Sir/Ma'am>, to make the best equipment for your arsenal I need not only the best materials, but to use the best techniques. Over the years I've developed a method to greatly strengthen my metal, but it does require an exotic resource: goren gut gas! The nearby mine at Kuuro's Claim just came down with an infestation of the things. Could you collect a few samples for the arsenal supplies? Just kill a few goren and give their bodies a good prod with this gas extractor. 
Use the Talbuk Lasso on a Young Silverpelt and follow it until it is tamed.	Taming a Talbuk	If we're going to start sending out patrols in this wilderness, we'll need swift mounts for our troops. We can capture young beasts and bring them back here for training, eventually turning them into formidable beasts of war. The talbuk is one of Draenor's fastest creatures, and that makes them just that much more difficult to capture. Take this talbuk lasso and head out to Shadowmoon Valley. Mount up and rope one of the young talbuk, and follow it until it's tamed. Don't let it get too far from you! 
Save 6 Kidnapped Children.	Where Are the Children?	The children have gone missing! That horrible Grumpus has been making his way throughout Draenor, snatching up children. Please save them! Our scouts have spotted him over in Frostfire Ridge. 
Slay 8 Adherent Bladewings.	Adherents of the Sun God	The arakkoa from Skyreach are all ruled by the Adherents of Rukhmar. They revile those of us who bear the Curse of Sethe, and decree that we must be purged in the name of their sun god. Soon their gaze will turn to lands beyond Arak. Challenge their warriors. Buy me time to prepare my escape, and help me set into motion their downfall. 
	Bloodthorn Cave	 
Slay 9 Wild Overgrowth.	Wake of the Genesaur	One moment we see a great metal beast rolling into our camp, the next a genesaur follows it and sends a wave of pure chaotic life at us. The manifestations left behind by the genesaur must be culled so we have time to salvage what we can before leaving. If you are here to help, then start killing as many of the violent plants that are assailing us as possible. 
Meet Rangari Arepheon inside Blademoon Bloom.	Blademoon Bloom	We are out of options. I'm going into the bloom to find out what's going on. I'll meet you inside. Goodluck, Mechanic.

Destroy 5 Unusual Gifts.	What Horrible Presents!	That mean old Grumpus has amassed a collection of odd gifts. He's deliberately trying to crush the spirit of children everywhere by giving out the worst presents imaginable. Take this spirit bomb. Toss it on some of Grumpus's unusual gifts and take them out for good! We're in this together, George. Now go and save the spirit of the holiday! 
	Grimfrost Hill	Free the Frostwolves being held by the Grimfrost ogres. 
Retrieve the Weathered Wingblades and Ragged Mask.	Hidden in Plain Sight	<Reshad begins hastily stuffing scrolls into his robes.>I thought I would have more time to prepare! There are powerful relics hidden out there in Skettis - if I leave without them, I may as well have died. The first is a pair of wingblades being held by an effigy near the front gate. You likely walked right past them on your way in. Another effigy on the east side of the ruins bears a white mask over its face. Bring those relics to me, and their secrets shall be yours. 
Kill 15 bog denizens.	Safety Measures	The batteries I lost in the bog have really ticked off the wild creatures. It's going to be impossible to remove them without fighting through who knows what. If you're up for it, why don't you 'take care' of any critters you come across? I don't want some giant beast stalking me back to the excavation site. I'll make it worth your while. 
Talk to Angar Steelbellow and choose which reinforcements to bring to Tanaan.	Bring the Reinforcements	Greetings, Commander! With all of the fighting concentrated here in Tanaan, we've got the breathing room to divert some of our resources from nearby outposts to help make headway. Just let me know which reinforcements to call, and I'll get them here on the double! 
Coax 5 Tenderhoof Meadowstompers.	New Babies	That's better, but there's still something wrong. I'm getting desperate here, George. Can I call ya, George? Great. Look, I think I have it now. I know what's wrong. They miss their babies. Yeah! When they first came here, the, uh... the bastard hunters that... abandoned them said they left the babies behind. If we're going to save them from a life of misery, if we're going to save those babies, <under his breath> and turn a tidy profit, we've got to get them some new babies! 
Search for Torg Earkeeper, Meka the Face Chewer, and Chag the Noseless in Razorbloom.	Mossy Fate	Your wolf queen will not let me out of her sight. The children of the magnaron may have destroyed my village but it was the children of the genesaur who took my people. The botani and their minions drag our people to the Razorbloom, and if we see them again, it is not as they were in life. You have already helped the Skulls, so I ask your help again. Enter the Razorbloom and search for my people that were recently taken. Perhaps they may even be alive. 
Speak to Thrall in Bladespire Citadel.	Great Balls of Fire!	Ga'nar led Ligra and the others to the second level of the fortress. Your friend, Thrall, also went to lend his skills. Follow the ramp on the south end of the ramparts outside to join them. Help them bring victory to the Frostwolf Clan! 
	Treasure: Fallen Ogre	 
Kill 15 Iron Horde at Mor'gran Logworks.	Too Many Irons in the Fire	We must slay the Iron Horde troops who infest our lands. Find those who would sully our great forest and show them the hand of justice. 
Acquire a Pristine Sporebat Stinger from a Moonglow Sporebat.	The Sting	The exarchs seem to trust you, Mechanic. Are you venturing into the Umbrafen? The Sporebats in this area are usually docile, but something's got them all riled up. When they attack, their stingers wrap around exposed limbs. I've seen them tear through reinforced leather like it was paper. How do they work, I wonder? Could you bring me a pristine sporebat stinger? I'd love to study it. 
	Rulkan	 
Find Soulbinder Tuulani in the Tomb of Lights.	Powering the Defenses	What few soulpriests we don't have on the front lines are working fervently to maintain Auchindoun's defenses. They aren't going to be able to keep it up much longer alone. Soulbinder Tuulani went inside the nearby Tomb of Lights to retrieve a backup power pylon and hasn't returned. I need you to find her and get her and the pylon back here safely. 
Speak with Challe to discover the truth.	Guise of the Deceiver	In a cave not far from here, there lives an old woman named Challe. I knew Challe many years ago when I was young; though as I have become old and grey, she has kept her youth and beauty. Challe was jealous of my love for Dahaka and I have long suspected that Challe had a part in her death. However, without evidence I could not bring justice against her. Meet with Challe and tell her that I am dying. Tell her that I wish to know the truth of Dahaka's fate before I leave this world. 
	Together We Are Strong	 
Use 5 Illusion Charms to draw out Adherent Harriers.	A Charming Deception	Reshad is more than he appears; a mottled old crow with his beak in a book, certainly, but we need him. Shadows gather beneath the lonely spire, in Veil Terokk. Reshad must make it there safely. Along the path you'll find charms primed with illusion spells. You need only touch them to take on Reshad's image. Adherent assassins are on the prowl for an old outcast with scrolls on his back. They will fall upon you. Oh, but won't they be surprised when the illusion fades?! Kee-hee-hee! 
Slay Sol-Shaper Veoryx and Sol-Shaper Krashyx.	Sol Sisters	When I was still a guard in Skyreach, I was tasked with protecting the sisters Veoryx and Krashyx. They were prodigies. At an age when most sun acolytes could barely read, the sisters conjured familiars of pure sunlight to illuminate their textbooks in the small hours. Now they unravel the secrets of Apexis technology, and their excavation has just breached two ancient chambers. Enter those chambers and cut down the sisters before they reap the terrible rewards of their discovery. 
Administer the Spiresalve to Kolrigg Stoktron in Southport.	No Time to Waste	We're in luck, commander. The antidote is relatively easy tae make. I've made a small amount with what I had on me. You should take it tae Kolrigg before it's too late. It'll keep him alive long enough for me tae make more. 
Use the Laughing Skull elixir to find Skulltaker and claim the Silent Skull.	The Silent Skull: Taking from the Taker	With the reagents found, you should seek out Grinning Tolg's camp in the nearby cave to brew the elixir. Once the elixir is consumed, you should be able to communicate with the ravagers there. With any luck, they should be able to bring you to Skulltaker. His mask should bring a hefty reward. 
Stop Grand Magister Reglakk's research.	Reglakk's Research	Okay so these orders say Reglakk is in charge of something called Breaker research, which makes super powerful ogres. I don't know about you but that sounds bad. I'm pretty hurt, do you think you can go up there alone and make Reglakk rethink his research? 
Speak the password to Ornekka at Crow's Crook.	The Crone	Do you remember our greeting, $p?""Shadows gather when the raven swallows the day.""It is more than an old verse - it is a call to action. Followers of the old ways are gathering, and I must join them. You are needed, too, I should thinkFollow this road down to Crow's Crook. There you will find the home of an old crone. Greet her as you greeted me, and she will guide the way. You will not see me, but I will be close behind. 
Kill Kor'gall and retrieve his axe, Serathil.	The Axe of Kor'gall	Time for vengeance! We are going to kill Kor'gall and you are going to take his axe.

Strike the first blow and we will join you in the cutting. 
Slay Huntmaster Sorrowfang and 10 Bloodmane Razorclaws.	The Bloodmane	We had just arrived and begun the service of the headless fowl when the Bloodmane attacked out of nowhere. Clearly, this means that the Raven Mother wishes to test the worthiness of her children. Fear not, we are steadfast and will fervently continue our prayers regardless of what may come!<Sekara leans in and whispers to you.>Although, if you can get rid of the Bloodmane and their leader that would be a blessing as well. 
Retrieve Lantresor's Blade from Instructor Luhk.	The Blade Itself	When they clapped me in irons, the Burning Blade instructor, Luhk the Keen-Eyed, took my blade. He's an honorable orc, even if his training techniques are counter-productive. I want my blade back, Mechanic. Then, I'll break myself free. 
Speak with Foreman Eksos in Talador.	Hero's Call: Talador!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Foreman Eksos in Talador. The Iron Horde seek to control Talador. The area is perfect to send reinforcements to any other part of Draenor quickly and without resistance. Foreman Eksos is currently establishing an outpost in Talador. Travel there and stop the Iron Horde. Glory to the Alliance! 
Collect Tall Buck's Tail from Tall Buck.	King of the Breezestriders	Let me guess, you found it in a talbuk's flank?<Ogka seems lost in thought for a moment.>That axe was intended for Tall Buck, king of the Breezestriders. Another talbuk - the one you killed - jumped in the way as I was taking my shot. I suggest you go after the king. When I was hunting him, he seemed fond of the pond at Lonely Falls to the south. 
Kill Gnaw Bloodseeker and 8 Pale Devourers.	Pale Moonlight	We are getting strange reports of an orc attack on a nearby draenei settlement called Eventide Landing. I'm hearing these particular orcs are unlike any we have encountered before. They seem... sickly, and are pale in color. The locals could use our help, commander. This seems like the perfect opportunity to test our garrison's capabilities. 
	Fiona	 
Use the Clefthoof Lasso on a Young Icehoof and follow it until it is tamed.	Capturing a Clefthoof	Way up north in the frozen peaks of Frostfire Ridge, you'll find the wooly clefthoof. They're sturdy, for sure, and fierce when you corner them. Don't expect them to be tamed without a fight. Here's a lasso, see if you can't manage to tame one before it tugs the rope out of your hands. 
Free 10 elemental spirits.	Dark Binding	Even as we speak, the pale within Shadowfall Canyon are enslaving the elements to their will. Many elemental spirits have already been enthralled, and more will follow. The pale must be stopped and the elementals they enslave set free. Journey into Shadowfall Canyon and set free those elemental spirits which are not fully enthralled by the pale. As for the elementals already enslaved by the pale, the only mercy we can give them now is to release their bonds through death. 
	Services of Dagg	 
Assault the Bleeding Hollow at Zeth'Gol in Tanaan Jungle.	Bleeding the Bleeding Hollow	The Bleeding Hollow provide significant reinforcement to the Iron Horde in Tanaan. From their home in Zeth'Gol they relentlessly pursue our scouts, disrupt our operations, and gather more power for Gul'dan's magic. We should consider a direct raid on Zeth'Gol to make them pull back their forces across the valley. This should give us some breathing room... for a time. 
Kill Enemy Players in Player versus Player combat to earn 20 Broken Bones then place an offering at the Altar of Bones to Earn a Conqueror's Tribute.

Go to the Vault of the Earth and speak with Lagar the Wise.	A Message of Terrible Import	Your scout... he got me out of that hellish place. Fel orcs surprised us out in the jungle and dragged us up the mountain. They tortured us... killed all but me. I fear one of us may have given up our secret before the end. I must ask you to go to the home of our order. Speak with Lagar, my leader, tell him... tell him Gul'dan knows. 
Follow the clue from the journal to find the Bonethorn Vine.	The Silent Skull: The Second Reagent	The second ingredient to the elixir is a vine from the Bonethorn plant. The journal reads:""I must find a vine of bonethorn, which grows in the bones of the ancient dead. I remember seeing the bones of a long-dead beast in the dry beds of the northern wilds. Its sun-parched skull would make a pleasant home for such a plant."" 
Destroy 4 Burning Resonators in the Burning Front.	Disrupting the Flow	You there, we need to stop the flow of demon reinforcements! Do you see the floating fel crystals spread throughout the front? Those resonators are powering the portals unleashing hell on our forces. I need you to take them out! 
Slay 5 goren in Moira's Reach.	Down the Goren Hole	These beasts came at us so fast we didn't have time to mount a proper defense. They went right for the metal and chewed through any wall we had. If we don't kill some of them soon they'll bring the whole fortress down on us. 
Awaken the Talon King.	A Worthy Vessel	The time has come, $p. Awaken the Talon King from his long slumber. Call him into this world so that he may destroy our enemies!

You must get that shield down. The only way to do it is to destroy the Arkonite crystal. Don't worry about me. You're going to kill two birds with one stone; Packleader Kargora is the one who stole your blueprints. 
Collect 8 Dread Raven Eggs.	The Egg Thieves	The Bloodclaw are sadistic creatures. They have attacked the Ravenskar before and have stolen the eggs of the sacred ravens. While you are within the Bloodclaw lands keep an eye out for the eggs. I'll be waiting for you at the nest with as many baskets for them as I can gather. 
Use the Effigy of Terokk to re-live Terokk's battle with the Bloodmane. Slay 30 Bloodmane Shortfangs, 20 Mature Bloodmane saberon, and Pridelord Karash.	The Talon King	<As Reshad begins reciting a tale of Terokk's glory days, your eyes fall to the twin swords at the effigy's belt. They had seemed so plain in Skettis, but now they thrum with power, as if reacting to the scrollkeeper's words.> 
Search Vigilant Outcast corpses for a Craftsman's Mark.	Assassin's Mark	Their poison is more powerful than I thought. We need to find the orc responsible for making it. Master assassins always leave their mark somewhere on one of their kills. It's a calling card; a claim to fame in their circles. This was definitely the work of such an assassin. We should split up and see if we can find some sign on one of the outcast corpses that will lead us to their creator. Rendezvous at the bottom of the hill, commander. 
Collect 6 Arkonite Crystals and an Arkonite Pylon from the Tomb of Lights.	We Must Construct Additional Pylons	We came here to retrieve a reserve pylon to power Auchindoun's defenses, but we've been pinned to this position by the Shadow Council for hours! I need to get these injured back to Exarch's Refuge, but we still need the backup system! Please, gather Arkonite crystals and an Arkonite pylon from the tomb and meet me at the refuge as quickly as you can! 
Disable the Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal in the Elodor Dig.	Shut 'er Down	Burrowing native creatures known as ""goren"" have tunneled into our crystal mines. Judging from our experience at the gates, I suspect my own experimental resonance crystal is whipping the native wildlife into a frenzy. Enter the Elodor Dig to the north and disable the malfunctioning resonance crystal! Be careful - my earthworkers report that the mine is crawling with those beasts. 
Speak to Lady Liadrin at the Burning Front in Talador.	The Lady of Light	George, yes? You are the one in charge here? I am Knight-Lord Dranarus, at your service. Lady Liadrin has responded to a suspected demon presence near Auchindoun, southwest of here. She has asked specifically for your assistance in ensuring Auchindoun does not fall into Gul'dan's hands. If you could set forth at your nearest convenience, I am sure the Lady would be most grateful. 
	Solidarity in Death	 
Kill Gutsmash the Destroyer in Frostfire Ridge.	WANTED: Gutsmash the Destroyer	Gutsmash has proven to be more than a worthy adversary. Gather a small group together and end his reign of terror once and for all. 
Speak to Shadow Hunter Ukambe at Axefall.	Inspecting the Troops	Axefall be just a moment's ride from here. I be markin' da location on your map and meet you dere. 
Ride with Durotan.	Of Wolves and Warriors	The return of many of my people is a boon to us, and I thank you for your part in their survival. Come, ride with me. We have much to discuss. 
Use the Iron Trap to capture a Clefthoof or Wolf in Frostfire Ridge and then place a Work Order at your Barn.	Breaking into the Trap Game	When we came through the portal, we weren't able to bring any of our animals with us. For us to produce leather and furs, we'll need to trap some of the native beasts and bring them back here. Although the plains are frozen, there are many clefthooves and wolves in Frostfire. We can gather leather from the clefthooves, or furs from the wolves. Take this iron trap and use it on a wounded adult beast. Bring the trapped creature back to us, and we will begin our work. 
Recover 6 Iron Horde Shipments.	Supply Recovery	We seem to have arrived at just the right time! The Gordunni have been enchanting armaments for the Iron Horde and it looks like they haven't picked up the latest shipment. We could put that gear to far better use in our artillery tower! Lets go hunt down their shipping containers. I brought some signal flares that we can use to call in an air pick-up when we've secured the shipment. 
	The True Path	 
Speak to Nisha.	Eye in the Sky	The notes you recovered tell of a device capable of subjugating even a magnaron. Ancient legends speak of such artifacts, crafted by the worldbuilders to keep these creatures in check. I had discounted them as silly stories, but if they are true...George, Draenor is doomed. No army will be able to stop them if they harness this power. We must stop them or die trying. Here, I shall bind our sight to Nisha and hope she can locate this artifact. 
Speak with Darkscryer Raastok near the Apexis Excavation.	Power Unearthed	What power could reduce a village to ashes in the blink of an eye? The Adherents claim it is the will of Rukhmar. A lie, obviously. They did nothing to earn such power - in truth, they stumbled upon it rather unwittingly, in a hole in the ground. Come and visit me near the excavation site just west of here. We must understand their technology if we are to defeat it. 
Slay 3 Dew Masters.	Coalpart's Revenge	I'm so full I can't swing an axe even if I had one. Tell ya what, we got a mutual interest here. I need yer help to get a little vengeance on the big botani at the back of this bloom. In return, I'll point ya in the right direction fer gettin' a secret weapon the botani keep. 
Collect 5 Star Readings.	Across the Stars	A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power comes from their understanding of the stars and their omens. For centuries, they have recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations. While you are in the fortress, collect some of these documents for me. We will take their own knowledge and use it against them. 
Find Captain Renault south of Pilgrim's Sojourn in Shadowmoon Valley.	Trouble to the South	A group of Alliance soldiers headed south from here not long ago. They said they were searching for some sort of special flower. To be frank, I'm concerned for their safety. This area is still crawling with Iron Horde. They could surely use your help if you're able. Follow the road south and you should find their position. 
Venture into Pinchwhistle Point and use the Vial of Untested Serum on an Infected Bruiser or Infected Lumberjack. Return to Krixel Pinchwhistle to report the results.	Field Trial	Look, I didn't tell Kimzee about this because I don't want to hurt her feelings, I chose not to leave Pinchwhistle Point. See, I've been working on a serum that I think should be able to cure the infected, but when I tried to test it I got surrounded and I injured my leg during the escape. I know I'm on the right track but I need to test it. Do me a favor and take this vial and go try it out on one of the infected outside. 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	The Rise and Fall of Barov Industries: Alexi Barov	[PHYLARCH ACQUISITION TEXT GOES HERE] 
Defeat Witch Lord Morkurk within Gordal Fortress.	The Lord of the Gordunni	Witch Lord Morkurk is the leader of the Gordunni. We need to kill him to secure the jovite for use in our artillery tower. Morkurk is an accomplished mage so you better be prepared. Here, take the rocket pack and use it if you need to avoid any of his deadly magic. Archenon poros! 
Drink the Major Elixir of Shadows at Zellek's hut in Veil Akraz.	Behind the Veil	Soon after the orcs swept in, Veil Akraz was laid to waste by a beam of light from Skyreach.<Ishaal's eyes glass over as he peers into his orb.>It seems they missed their true target. Zellek is still there, hiding in the realm of shadow. And... someone else as well. The orc assassin who used my orb. Take this. Drink it in Veil Akraz and find Zellek. Oh, and be careful. It's a little more potent than the last one. You'll see... 
Place the Plume of Anzu in the Offering Basket in Gnarlwood Pass.	Cult of the Ravenspeakers	These outcasts are not the only cursed arakkoa holding their ground in Arak. A curious cult has formed in worship of Ka'alu, my consort and the keeper of my brood. They are considered to be quite... odd. Regardless, the outcasts will need their help. Without the wings of the ravens, Iskar can never take his fight to the spires. Take this feather and place it in the offering basket south of here. The so-called ""Ravenspeakers"" will surely take notice. 
Bring Lithic's Gift to Reshad in Veil Terokk.	A Sentimental Relic	My father's bangle sat here for ages before that imposter Ikiss stole it away. I thank you for returning it, but I have no need for keepsakes. Take it, with my blessing. If there are still Talonpriests loyal to the true Talon King, please bring it to them. 
Gather 6 Spectral Essences from restless spirits inside the garrison and use them to convince Alice Finn of her fate.	A Parting Favor	I don't know what happened. My crew and I must have been the first to fall. My wife, the innkeeper, is in the same stupor you found me in. I can feel it... and there are others with her. Please, give the townsfolk peace and show their essences to my wife. That should bring her back from that cold abyss. 
Fly to the Spirit Woods.	The Call of Oshu'gun	The elements have spoken and a vision has been revealed, George. Together we shall travel to the great mountain Oshu'gun and put an end to the dark disturbance there. If what you saw in the vision is to be believed, then great danger awaits us. I will meet you in the Spirit Woods at the foot of Oshu'gun. When you are ready to depart, speak with Gixmo Moneycash and he will fly you to there. 
Take the Frostwolf Axe to Stalker Ogka at Wor'var.	Someone's Missing Axe	<A throwing axe of frostwolf make is sticking out of the side of this talbuk. Perhaps Stalker Ogka will be interested in your find.> 
Collect 3 Frostshards.	Frosted Fury	The furies of Draenor are different than the elementals of Azeroth. But don't be fooled. Some be wicked, boss-mon. Wicked. The trap we are making be needing some proper frostshards. You can get them, if ya willing, from the ice furies. Dey be wandering the Cracking Plains, freezin' all dat dey touch, an' bein' wicked. Bring us some o' these frostshards, boss-mon, an' we gonna whip ya up one deadly trap. 
Speak to Taskmaster Gornek at Axefall.	Not Here, Not Now	I will travel to your people to make arrangements soon. For now, begone. Leave me in peace. 
Speak to Ravenspeaker Sekara in the Ravenskar.	Rendezvous with the Ritualists	Our dear brother Sekara went to the Ravenskar with some of the flock to enact the great ritual of purification. No one has been sent back to the nest for supplies in the past day; caught up in prayers I suppose. I would go check on him but I need to make sure the scribe didn't mess up her transcription of my latest sermon. Could you do it? I'll be there in... well, who knows... 
Slay 6 Infested Orcs.	The Infested	I understand Kaz's desire to rescue her people, but her plan is reckless and she is not telling us everything. I came along to make sure she wasn't devising a plan against us and now I see this... this... horror. What did the botani do to these orcs? These infested souls need to be put to rest. Give them peace. 
Pick Youngroot for Beezil.	Forever Young	All this sitting around is horrible for business. I have to find a way to recoup some of my lost profits. Those Draenei females are obsessed with the way their horns look. I overheard one of them talking about a root that grows in Blademoon Bloom that supposedly reduces horn shedding or something. I bet I could sell that root to them for a pretty nice profit. I'll give you a cut if you help me get a supply going. 
Harvest a Timber Sample from Small Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.	Easing into Lumberjacking	<Sir/Ma'am>, we're going to need a lot of lumber if we're going to build this garrison into a suitable fortress. That means we're going to have to do a little work. While I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree a lumberjack will come chop it down and give you the timber. Let's give our lumberjacks a test run. There's a tree nearby! 
Gather 8 Iridium Dust from Iridium Geodes in Kuuro's Claim.	Iridium Recovery	Ared used to always teach me that the purity of the metal is key. If the metal isn't pure it will crack under stress and be of no use to anyone. For the artillery tower to function I'll need to make metal as pure as my master would, and for that I need a strong flux. The dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch, but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby. 
Find and rouse the missing Trader.	Tricks of the Trade	To pass the time, traders have been known to consume beverages of an inspired nature, if you know what I mean. Sometimes, they drink a bit too much. Your trader might have stumbled beyond the gates and passed out under a tree. It's been known to happen from time to time. Luckily, I have a brew that I use to rouse groggy traders. One splash and I find they're more willing to work. 
Find the Iron Shredder Decommission Orders.	Shredder Manual	I've been hearing rumors of this new prototype shredder the Iron Horde's engineers have been working on. I think we ought to investigate. A shadow hunter spotted some sort of shredder manual, and it might have something to do with that prototype. 
Kill Uruk Foecleaver.	The Pride of Lok-rath	You think the Warsong are so easily defeated?<There's a rasping sound, like rope on metal.>I'm already tired of you Alliance, and you've just invaded my homeland.<The sound becomes more pronounced as Uruk Foecleaver looks you straight in the eye.>There will be no surrender. The Warsong bow to no one! 
Retrieve Bryan Finn's Schematic from Spectral Laborers.	I See Dead People	Th... they're ghosts! All of them! Bryan was one of my best friends. Something is clouding his mind; we need to snap him out of it and get to the bottom of this! He was always obsessed with his work. Maybe showing him one of his schematics would help. One of the spectral laborers might have one. 
Close 3 Void Portals by killing Shadowmoon Portalmasters.	Closing the Door	The Shadowmoon orcs are using portals to bring in reinforcements and smuggle away draenei captives. If we are to have any hope of retaking the village, we must destroy the portals at once. The only way to do this is to kill the portalmasters who keep the rifts open. 
Speak with Exarch Maladaar at the Fey Landing south of Elodor.	Exarch Maladaar	The council is almost assembled: Othaar, myself, Hataaru and Naielle are ready. Only Exarch Maladaar remains. He has not been himself since he returned from his capture at the hands of the Iron Horde... but Vindicator Maraad was able to track him down. Find Maladaar at the Fey Landing, just south of the town center. 
Speak to Rokhan at your garrison in Frostfire Ridge.	News from Nagrand	Welcome back, <sir/mam>. One of our shadow hunters delivered a message about a caravan being dispatched for Nagrand. Rokhan's awaiting your approval on a new outpost. I've been hearing whispers around camp about Nagrand. They say it's Warsong territory. They might need your help <sir/mam>. 
Defeat the Gorian Beast-Lasher while riding your Snarler-In-Training.	Wolf Training: Cruel Ogres	The wolves of this land are the most savage beasts I have seen, and surely do not fear orc nor ogre. Bring him to bear against once of the ogres that you are familiar with. The Gorian Beast-Lasher, the one that smells of blood and fear, see how the wolf reacts to him. 
Follow the clue in the journal to find Vok Blacktongue. Defeat him and claim the Cracked Crystal Shard.	Dream of Argus: The Second Fragment	The second orc that Matuun mentioned was a master runecarver and sorcerer. He should be located somewhere in the main camp. The journal reads:""She mentioned that the orc could normally found in one of the runemaster's huts in the southern part of the camp. They could be identified by the standing stones surrounding the structure, as well as the floating runestones above."" 
Collect the Assorted Engineering Parts, Prop Rotor, and Transmission Flywheel.	Up and Running	The Warsong struck us hard. We lost Telaar, but we have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong. We need your wisdom and leadership to pull it off, George. First though, we're going to get our survivors out of Telaar. My rangari are ready to strike. We just need to get you to them. Thaelin has a copter that can get you to them. Unfortunately, his hands are full just trying to keep the infernal thing running. Help him get it up and running? 
Find the Missing Mole Machine.	Lost Mole Machines	Few people know the Blackrock clan better than Dark Iron dwarves. So after Tanaan, we sent a bunch of mole machines to Gorgrond to build a listenin' post to keep an eye on them. Me own mole machine got way off course an' I got separated. It didn't take long to figure out all the other mole machines got off course as well. Accordin' to the readin's in me tank, a mole machine surfaced somewhere way to the west of here. Mind scoutin' ahead while we get this tank operational? 
Kill 8 Crimsonwing Wasps.	Clearing Out Before Cleaning Up	Here's the situation. We need to get this salvage operation moving ASAP, but the ship went down right in the middle of the wasp nests. The ugly bugs are all over the place, and I can't call my team in here to start work until they're taken care of. Go kill as many of 'em as you can and I'll cut you in on some of the haul. 
Find Vindicator Nobundo at the Throne of Elements.	Nobundo Sends Word	Your presence has been requested at the Throne of Elements, George. Vindicator Nobundo has heard the call of the furies upon the wind and made the journey to commune with the elements. I know not what the intentions of the furies are, but they are revered as noble and powerful spirits by the orcs. 
Speak with Lokra at Wolf's Stand.	To Thunder Pass	There is no time to mourn our fallen or lick our wounds. Your scouts have already reported sighting a massive Iron Horde army making its way through Thunder Pass. I advise you let your garrison forces secure this area while you and I make for the pass east of here with the rest of the Frostwolves. It is time to show this Iron Horde what a united Frostwolf clan can do. 
Take the trophy to Maraad at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Khargax the Devourer	Defeating Khargax has yielded you a trophy worthy of showing off at your outpost. Return this to Maraad to increase your glory! 
Assault the Iron Horde forces at the Fel Forge in Tanaan Jungle.	Assault on The Fel Forge	The Iron Horde is growing stronger each day as their war machines are empowered with fel magic. We have even obtained word that they are constructing a Fel Reaver! Head to the Fel Forge and destroy their forces before we are overwhelmed. 
Kill 500 Blood Elf Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.	Nemesis: Slayer of Sin'dorei	<Kuros hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death. Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all blood elves that stand defiantly against the Alliance. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Horde: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of blood elf. Conquer our enemy and be known as slayer of Sin'dorei. Fail and be nothing. 
Follow the clue from Megacharge's Cookbook to find the high voltage detonator.	Dark Grimoire: The Second Ingredient	With the blasting powder acquired, you now must find a suitable detonator. A note attached to the entry in the cookbook hints to where one might be found:""Reminder: Order more high-voltage detonators. The last shipment was lost off of the Shadowmoon coast near the demon-inhabited cliffs. Maybe we should send a diving team to salvage."" 
	Joining the Ranks	 
	Treasure: Lagoon Pool	 
	Zorkra's Fall	 
Bring Anne Dunworthy 100 Artifact Fragments for a Captian's Whistle.	Captian's Whistle	 
	Armor Up	 
Slay 15 Shattered Hand orcs in Camp Thornscar.	New Neighbors	The Shattered Hand clan is made up of orcs who can call no other clan home. They are sadistic warriors who maim their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity or perhaps because they simply enjoy the pain. It does not matter. What matters is that they are expanding their territory, butchering anyone in their path. They must be dealt with. 
Retrieve 5 Submerged Batteries.	Sticky Situation	A squadron of arakkoa spotted us while we were en route to the excavation site and took out our caravan. My brother made it to safety in the chaos. Lucky son of a tinker. I can't leave without the batteries for our drill, but they all fell into the bog and I can't even get them to budge. Any chance you could retrieve them for me? 
Destroy 12 Boneship crew members.	Culling the Crew	If we're going to protect Draenor from the Bonefleet menace, we'll need to thin out the crew. See to a swift reduction in their numbers, and we might just push them back into the sea for another year. 
Get to the Pool of Visions and kill Warleader Gargrak.	The Farseer	The Thunderlord warleader... George, you have to stop him. He went to attack Drek'Thar at the Pool of Visions to the northwest! 
Speak with Rangari D'kaan at Telaari Station.	Lok-rath is Secured	With their leader dead, the remaining Warsong will be easier to finish. As soon as that's done, I'll pull our soldiers out of Lok-rath and head for Grommashar. If you're heading back to Telaari Station, would you please inform D'kaan? 
Collect 20 Potent Pollen.	Pollen Power	The botani use monstrous insect-like creatures to pollinate their bloom. The pollen they carry has a number of powerful properties that would be of use to your garrison forces. If you bring me a reserve of this pollen I should be able to convert it to something of value. 
Find Burrian Coalpart in Evermorn Springs.	Dark Iron Down	While you were away our rangari here found more clues leadin' to some of me other friends. Burrian Coalpart and Scorchbrow. Problem is, their trail heads right for Evermorn Springs to the west. Please Commander, will ya get in there and save them from mulching? 
Find Kimzee Pinchwhistle in Pinchwhistle Point.	Follow that Hotrod!	Miss Kimzee is one tough nugget but Pinchwhistle Point is too dangerous for her to handle alone. It'll be a catastrophe for morale if our boss gets infected. I need to get these crewmen back to the Gearworks so I need you to go and make sure she is alright. Her uncle's place is the tower just on the other side of the oil fields; I think you should look for her around there. 
Kill 8 Shadowmoon Voidmancers.	Dark Enemies	Your arrival should be cause for celebration, hero, but I fear our troubles are just beginning. Warlord Ner'zhul and his Shadowmoon clan have launched a surprise attack on a draenei settlement to the north. Prophet Velen has gone to aid the wounded at Teluuna Observatory, but we need more defenders. I must go to assist the others. If you wish to help us, go to Arbor Glen and kill any Shadowmoon enemies that you see. 
Place Terokk's Gavel on the Effigy of Terokk.	Rites of the Talonpriests	That gavel was once known as Beakbreaker. In his final, darkest days, Terokk used it to perform grim, damnable acts of sacrifice. It is best not to dwell on those days. Terokk was sealed away deep within the shadows to rest, and perhaps to heal. Making contact with him will take a great deal of effort, so in the meantime, allow me to tell you of his more glorious exploits. Before this wretched curse took hold. Please, place the gavel upon the effigy. 
Slay 8 Adherents and Windkeeper Koreyx. Speak with Ka'alu for a ride to Windswept Terrace.	On Ebon Wings	Now we bring our fight to the Adherents. Raastok is certain his new invention will give us control of the Apexis weapons, but we must get close - very close. Ka'alu and her ravens will fly us to the Windswept Terrace. We shall gain a foothold there before pressing on to the Terrace of Dawn. 
Speak with Qiana Moonshadow.	Qiana Moonshadow	If we are to win this war we are going to need more than foot soldiers. We need champions. Qiana Moonshadow's performance in Tanaan and Eventide Landing was quite impressive. Perhaps you should speak with her about taking on a greater role in the battle against the Iron Horde. 
Speak with Shadow Hunter Rala at Darkspear's Edge.	We Be Needin' Supplies	Commander, our forces are not prepared for frost fightin'. I took da liberty and sent some of our shadow hunters north to establish a supply base. Ya might want to be headin' up dere and see what they be up to. Look for a hollow between the Crackling Plains and the Savage Crag. 
Take the proof to Limbflayer at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Orc Thorn	This thorn is proof of your strength at slaying the infested and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the thorn back to Limbflayer and claim your accolades! 
Speak to Dusk-Seer Irizzar near Veil Terokk.	Befriending the Locals	We need allies desperately if we want a chance at surviving until tomorrow. We've made contact with one of the outcast arakkoa, but he refused to discuss alliances without speaking to you first. He called himself Dusk-Seer Irrizar. You should speak with him, commander. You can find him just southwest of Veil Terokk. 
Recruit a follower from Lysa Serion in the Lunarfall Inn.	The Headhunter's Harvest	The inn provides a perfect place for adventurers to take a rest between their travels. It's also a great place to talk them into joining our cause over a few rounds of drinks. Go through my selection and let's see if we can obtain a new recruit. I'll give you a little something as a finder's fee for your efforts. 
	A Bunch of Artifact Fragments	 
Speak with Narnin Dawnglow, Beska Redtusk, and Zarjhin.	Inspiring Ashran	I hope you will find our facilities to be up to your high standards. This inn is run by Narnin Dawnglow, in my opinion this is the best place to hearth in Draenor. We have new recruits coming through the portal daily. In fact one of out latest recruits, Zarjhin, just came through the portal today. If you are looking for weapons or armor Beska Redtusk will be happy to help. 
Use the Fetish of Samedi on the corpses of the dead shadow hunters.	The Blessing of Samedi	Three of mah shadow huntas come here wit' me. De Warsong kill dem. We need ta help dey souls move on. Jus' in case ya find dem first, use dis on dere bodies. It send dere souls ta Samedi, Loa of de Grave. 
Collect Doomshot.	Just In Case	When we set up shop the first thing we built was the cannon. Seemed like a good place fer it. We started buildin' the base up around it when them chompin' acid spittin' varmints came crawlin' out of the ground. The upside though is the cannon is built, just not loaded. We have to go down to the bottom floor of this thing anyway so may as well grab some Doomshot if you see any on your way down. Better to load the cannon and not need it than to need it and not have it loaded. 
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Meadowstomper-In-Training.	Elekk Training: The Garn	The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land. The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them. There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your elekk, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your elekk will truly be ready. 
Use the Arcane Dissipator on 8 Frenzied Manafeeders.	Frenzied Manafeeders	There is a rare breed of moth in Talador known as the Manafeeder. These moths sustain themselves by feeding on arcane crystal dust from the mine. Typically speaking, these moths are nothing more than an occasional nuisance. However, they are now gorging themselves upon the intense arcane energy flooding out of the mine and have become highly territorial and aggressive. I have attuned this crystal to disperse arcane energy. Please use it on the Frenzied Manafeeders to soothe them. 
Activate the Apexis device and claim the Amulet of Rukhmar.	Amulet of Rukhmar: The Apexis Device	Now that the keys have been activated, the Apexis device that leads to the amulet should be accessible. The Arakkoa research states that it is likely located in Lost Veil Anzu, within the ""shrine to the raven god."" 
Speak with Yanas Seastrike at the dry docks.	Strange Tools	We are well on our way to building our first ship, but unfortunately, I am not the orc for the job. I have no idea how to work with these human tools. Your shipwright, Yanas Seastrike, is going to take over from here on out. I will be here at the dry docks if you need anything from me. 
	Mage Tower Complete	 
	Meatgut Needs Bones	 
Kill 6 Lunarfall Ravens.	Ravenous Ravens	Do you see that? There is a gigantic raven just past the tree line. I'm not getting anywhere near that. In fact, I'm not sure any of the men are sufficiently equipped to deal with a threat like that. Do you want to handle this one yourself, commander? Once those ravens are gone we can start sending more troops into the woods. So we will be killing two birds with one stone... or should I say kill five birds with...<Confused by his own analogy, Baros scratches his head.>You get the point. 
Destroy the three Shadow Orbs in Gul'rok.	Hiding in the Shadows	<The voice of Teron'gor enters your mind.>Our final move must remain concealed from the Auchenai, my minions. Use the shadow orbs Gul'dan provided for us to veil Gul'rok in darkness. Prepare our forces, we march on Auchindoun on my order. We will feast on the souls of the draenei and usher our demonic allies into this world!<Destroying these shadow orbs would help the defenders at Auchindoun greatly.> 
Speak to Restalaan at Retribution Point.	Changing the Tide	It is time to retaliate against this foe. Meet me at Retribution Point and we will take this fight to the Shadow Council. Teron'gor shall not feast on another soul so long as we stand in his way! His reign of terror ends today. 
Collect Sky-Singer Strag's Totem.	Only the Winner	I am Gronnstalker Rokash, and I only serve the winning side. I have heard of some of your deeds, commander, and seen the corpses left in the wake of you and your forces. I have grown tired of my current clan. They are soft, weak, and losing. I offer you this challenge: enter Colossal's Fall to the north and slay Sky-Singer Strag. Claim her totem as a trophy and I will hail you as my new chieftain. 
	Call to Arms	 
Collect barrels of Frostwolf Oil and deliver it to Gol'kosh in the supply room.	Deeds Left Undone	In his haste, Ga'nar advanced before this area was secured. He is a matchless warrior, mind you, but his tactics are sometimes costly. Gol'kosh and his troops were ordered to destroy enemy supplies, but ogres have stolen the oil he needs. Retrieve the oil and see that their mission is carried out, traveler. Then, if they still live, direct them to rejoin me at the citadel's entrance. I must see my wounded brothers to safety. 
Activate 6 Spore-be-Gone Turrets.	Spore-be-Gone	We got an emergency! A bunch of spore drifters have infested the shore and tore up our Spore-B-Gone turrets. We're caught with our armor off here! If we don't get those turrets back online then those spores are going to float right in to town and then we'll have another Pinchwhistle Point on our hands!

Speak with Shelly, find Assistant Brightstone, and check the Garrison Cache.	Keeping it Together	So much work to do... I don't even know where to start. Making sure this garrison is operational is not an easy task. Shelly still hasn't reported back to me, my assistant Brightstone and her crew are who knows where, ugh... I'm so caught up I haven't even had time to check our cache for resources. If I were a mage, do you think I could use mirror images to do all of this at once? 
Deal with Rorka at Axefall.	Not In Your Army	Your men caught one of da new recruits, talking with da alliance behind your back. She be a traitor, boss-mon! She be a danger to everything you've worked so hard for. We have a wyvern ready to be takin' her to your garrison for proper punishment.

	LFGDungeons - Draenor - Raid Finder - 1st	 
Attune to the four elemental pillars.	Elemental Attunement	Even now, as we speak, the voice of Kalandrios continues to whisper to my mind.""The Hero of Azeroth must attune to the elements of the plateau.""Upon the Elemental Plateau are four great pillars carved of living rock.

Kill Shui Halad.	The Sleeper Has Awakened	Something has awakened the great Shui Halad. She is causing the ground to quake.<The farseer makes a sign of warding in the air, and then continues.>Perhaps those who have disturbed the great worm are the same ones your friends are tracking down? Either way, Shui Halad must be put to eternal rest before her thrashing collapses all of the north into the ocean. 
Kill 100 Iron Horde in Tuurem using the Iron Shredder.	Born to Shred	The Iron Shredder is operational! It should be primed and ready for you to shred our enemies in Tuurem! Head inside and see what damage you can do. Can't say I'm not jealous.

In the cave, there be right mean ogron dey call ""Grosh the Mighty."" That ogron got a big stash of pillaged hides and leathers we gonna be needin' for the troops at the garrison.

Take these vials to the cave and see if ya can't win us a treasure. 
Investigate the Iron Horde camp in Sulfur Basin.	We Have Company	Commander, I've spotted Iron Horde soldiers nearby. It is bold, even for them, to venture into such deadly territory. If we do not deal with their presence, they will surely be a threat to your camp. While I scout deeper into the canyons, may I request your help in investigating the camp? 
Collect $1Oa Crystallized Goren Scales from Crystalmaw goren in the Elodor Dig.	Engorged Goren	You must be the Mechanic that so impressed Exarch Hataaru. Can you help? The Elodor Dig just behind me is overrun by strange stone creatures. These so-called goren actually devour minerals, metabolize them, and grow crystalline structures from their arms and back. Like most of the wildlife on this world, they completely baffle us. Please slay as many as you can and gather their crystal scales for me. You'll be protecting our earthworkers and aiding our research at the same time. 
Slay 8 Acidtooth Devourers.	Goren, Goren, Gone!	We... we left the goren alone for too long. They have grown bold and forgotten who we are. Kill them! Kill them all. Rip them apart until they scream. Remind them what happens to anyone who tries to attack a Laughing Skull village. Oh, and welcome to Gorgrond. 
Use Thaelin's Copter to get up to the Rangari Overlook.	Operation: Surprise Party	There weren't many survivors of the Warsong attack. The few remaining rangari have gone up to one of the bluffs overlooking Telaar. The rangari are waiting for you. They're planning a surprise counter-attack. My copter's taken a beating. The auto-pilot's set to take you up there. I think she's got one last trip in her. Maybe. 
Free 5 Frostwolf Slaves from the Sootstained Mining Camp.	Slavery and Strife	We have their citadel, but they still have some of my people enslaved at the Sootstained Mines. We have no one to spare, but you seem more than capable of handling a few ogres on your own. I ask that you release any enslaved Frostwolves you find there, and keep an eye out for Mulverick. 
Meet up with Lantresor of the Blade inside the Masters' Cavern.	Meet Me in the Cavern	It's time, Mechanic. Time for you to get your blueprints. Time for us to face the masters. 
Slay Harvester Ommru.	A Harvester Has Come	This is what happens when one stands in the path of a genesaur. And where a genesaur walks, the botani follow. I saw one entering our shelter cave along the northern side of the camp. It is commanding the podlings to gather the corpses of our fallen brethren and must be stopped. I must tend to our wounded, and gather supplies for our departure. If you are serious about being a hero, venture into the cave and slay this botani. 
Find Cutter.	Cutter	You found many Laughing Skulls. All friends, all loved, all dead. But you did not find my precious Cutter. They must have taken him to Evermorn Springs. Find him, and rescue him. He is a good boy, and deserves a better death than infesting. I am going to round up some ravagers and take the place by air. Look for me in Evermorn if you find Cutter before I do. 
	Treasure: Basket of Arakkoa Goods	 
Burn 5 Ancient Seedbearer corpses.	Seedbearers of Bad News	When these seedbearers are slain their seeds survive. From them spring new seedbearers, not over years, but hours.

Take the trophy to Maraad at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Dessicus	Defeating Dessicus has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim. Take this to Maraad at Highpass. 
Mark 8 trees.	Looking for Lumber	Some of the trees around here look small enough that the workers should be able to down them in no time. We can leave the hard labor to Shelly's men, but if you'd be willing to mark the trees for them to start with, we should be able to get this operation rolling much faster. 
	The Dark Lady's Gift	 
	Talonpriest Ishaal	 
Kill 8 Widow Wasps.	A Lack of Wasps	The stings! These cursed wasps drone day and night and their constant aggression taxes me so. I shall do nothing about your offer until these nuisances are dealt with. 
Assault the Iron Horde reinforcements at Ironhold Harbor in Tanaan Jungle.	Assault on Ironhold Harbor	The Iron Horde continue to bring in reinforcements from all over Draenor to reinforce their position at Hellfire Citadel. If we don't cut off the flow of supplies then we risk losing control of our plans in Tanaan. A strategic attack to the supply lines at Ironhold Harbor is just the thing to keep the Iron Horde on the defensive and maintain our momentum. 
Use 8 Frostwolf Banners on Bladespire Ogre corpses.	These Colors Don't Run	Bladespire has been a plague on my people for many years. That ends today! Now to explain it to the ogres in a way they will understand. If you still wish to help us, place our banner in the corpses of our adversaries. Their courage will falter as they behold a field of Frostwolf trophies! This is our way. I will meet with you ahead when you have completed this deed. 
Meet Durotan at Bladespire Citadel.	Moving In	Gorr'thog is now dead. It is time now to secure our hold on Bladespire Citadel. Meet me below and we can begin strengthening our presence. 
	Vignette: Embaari Defense Crystal	 
Capture the All-Seeing Eye.	Catching His Eye	For what must be done, I need someone I can trust. You're one of those few. The woods and the orc village, Gul'var, are protected from my scrying magic. We need to pierce that veil. I think I know a way. There's a fel presence within the woods. A demonic watcher is there, hidden in a cave from which it casts its all-seeing gaze. I would like for you and the warden to capture it. 
	Hemet's Happy Hunting Grounds	 
Show the weaponization orders to Rexxar at Breaker's Crown.	The Gronn Strategy	Raz,Your orders are to capture four additional gronn for weaponization. Of your first group, only one survived the entire process. One attacked our soldiers relentlessly and had to be put down. Another fell victim to a misfire while being fitted. Yet another rolled onto its cannons in its sleep. We're still cleaning up that mess. Rest assured, your efforts are not in vain.- Captain Brak 
Speak with Azik in the Spires of Arak.	Warchief's Command: Spires of Arak!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Azik in Spires of Arak. There have been wingless arakkoa seen fleeing from Spires of Arak. Rumors suggest that they are running from an Iron Horde superweapon. We need to find out what is causing them to leave their homeland, and why their wings have withered. For the Horde! 
Collect 10 pieces of Timber from around Draenor and then Place a Work Order at your Garrison's Lumber Mill.	Turning Timber into Profit	Now that you know how to put peons to work harvesting timber, we're going to create a work order for your mill. But first we're going to need some timber to process! All around Draenor are juicy trees ripe for the chopping. Go out and find suitable timber for the lumber mill. Come back here when you have enough and we'll get started on a work order. And as usual, let the peons do the hard work. Just keep 'em protected. Draenor's a dangerous place! 
Aid the Alliance and Horde assault at The Iron Front in Tanaan Jungle.	Battle At The Iron Front	General, our troops are currently engaged in a conjoined assault at the Iron Front. The fight has been raging for some time now, and casualties are high. Report to the Iron Front and lend your strength to the war effort. I have no doubt that your presence on the battlefield will inspire the soldiers to victory! 
Speak to Magister Serena at the entrance to Gordal Fortress.	The Foot of the Fortress	Your forces are at the ready and the scroll is prepared. It's time for phase two - stealing a nexus crystal from a fortified ogre compound. We'll save the scroll to bring in reinforcements in our confrontation with the Gordunni Witch Lord. Let's meet at the base of the Gordal Foothills to head into the fortress proper. 
Speak with Lieutenant Howell.	Host Howell	Lieutenant Howell said you might be showing up. It's such an honor to meet you in person. The lieutenant is at the inn, I'll escort you over there. 
	LFGDungeons - Draenor - Heroic Random - 1st	 
Collect the Pendants of Brol, Krag, and Mol.	Slave Hunters	Anytime a gladiator escapes Stonemaul, they send their hardened slave hunters after us. I consider myself a capable warrior, years of surviving in an arena have taught me that. But these slave hunters keep pendants magically tethered to the slaves. With these pendants they can track us down anywhere we go, and kill us in our sleep or when our guard is down. I have no right to ask this, but can you enter Stonemaul and retrieve these pendants? 
	Feline Friends Forever	 
Find Khaano near the Crimson Fen in Gorgrond.	Rangari in the Red	Gorgrond is a very dangerous place and I've sent scouting squads out to investigate various regions.

	Trophy Hunter of Gorgrond	 
Collect Crulgorosh's Orders and Thulgork's Orders at Mar'gok's Overwatch.	Obtaining Ogre Offensive Orders	My sister, Mirana, is scouting the upper bluff while I've checked out the lower area. There are two particular ogre mages that do a lot of bossing around in the lower area. They seem to have some orders or scrolls on them that would help us figure out what's really going on. Collect that information and meet with my sister on the long stairway up there. 
Rout 12 Shadow Council forces in Telmor.	Payback	We thought we were safe behind Leafshadow's cloaking veil.<Vindicator Kaluud wipes the blood from his face.>Someone told the Shadow Council's forces how to disable it. We were able to hold them off at first...Most of the town was slaughtered in the attack. Please, you must avenge our fallen. Rout these invaders out from Telmor forever! 
Find Mr. Knuckles' missing shipment.	The Missing Manifest	The water-proofed manifest contains some form of code for the most part, hiding the contents of the actual manifest. In the corner is a hastily scrawled note for a Mr. Knuckles. ""Shipment attacked, got away but boat is sinking. Get here before they do.""There are coordinates after that which lead to the sunken boat. Mr. Knuckles is definitely the kind of person you want owing you a favor, not the other way around. 
Find food for Rooter at Rooter's Pass in Gorgrond.	Rooter the Ravenous	The stray boar is digging through garbage left behind by the iron horde. He stops chewing and stares at you-then he burps. He smells terrible. It looks like he's chewing on a chunk of rotten meat. Maybe you can find something a bit healthier for him to snack on? 
	Affliction Ridge	 
Kill 500 Gnome Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.	Nemesis: Gnomebane	<Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death. Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all gnomes that stand defiantly against the Horde.

Conquer our enemy and be known as draenei destroyer. Fail and be nothing. 
	Garrison Pet Battle	 
Bring the Shimmering Timewarped Crystal to Kronnus in Warspear.	The Shimmering Crystal	Though the crystal appears familiar at first, upon contact with your finger it reveals itself as so much more. A grand, lost civilization appears in front of you. Fixtures of gold shimmer in every direction, bright feathers of purple occasionally falling from overhead. You hear the distant sounds of battle, culminating in a thunderous explosion that overwhelms all of your senses and turns your vision white. When your vision returns, you feel something within you pulling you toward Ashran. 
Recover 6 Shadow Tomes from Veil Shadar.	Forbidden Knowledge	<Darkscryer Raastok narrows his eyes and looks you up and down.>So, you are Iskar's hired hand? Well, I care not whether you are |5Human or an overgrown moth, so long as you are willing to help. The Adherents of Rukhmar are closed-minded fools! They forbid the study of shadow magic, branding as heretics anyone who dares to seek answers in the dark. We kept many tomes of forbidden knowledge in Veil Shadar. Bring any you find to me, and I will reward you for keeping them from the flames. 
Collect 4 Volatile Oil.	Skimming Off the Top	That flying machine is our ticket out of here but its fuel tank is bone dry! We're right next to the oil fields but with the infected out there we don't have time to run a line up here so we need to improvise. The oil creatures moving next to the pumps out there are full of a highly potent mixture that I can drop right into the tank. Grab some of that oil for me and we'll be one step closer to getting out of here. 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar at Starfall Outpost.	Meet Us at Starfall Outpost	The archmage has uncovered a potential Shadow Council presence in the valley. He asked me to let you know. As soon as you can, join us at Starfall Outpost. We're going to need your muscle to root them out, commander. 
Save Squiggy by dousing fires with buckets of water.	In Need of a Hero	I...<sob>... I can't leave...<gulp>... without... Squiggy...!He... he's... trapped! You need... to put out... the fire!<Ariaana points across the room and bursts into tears.> 
	Ruins of the First Bastion	 
	Oath of Shadow Hunter Rala	 
Collect 9 Goren Shells from Boneyard Gorgers.	Hard Shell	I have already learned much from watching the Laughing Skull. Traveling through goren tunnels was thought to be impossible due to the acid they leave behind, but the orcs found a way around it. We will need some of the shells of goren within the canyon. If you see any of their tunnel craters ready to burst, approach them and goren will come pouring out. This way, you can kill many at once and find the shells more quickly. 
Kill 500 Orc Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.	Nemesis: Orcslayer	<Kuros hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death. Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all orcs that stand defiantly against the Alliance. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Horde: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of orc. Conquer our enemy and be known as orcslayer. Fail and be nothing. 
Collect 25 Bleeding Hollow Ritual Blades from Bleeding Hollow orcs in Zeth'Gol.	Bloodied Blades of Zeth'Gol	Them Bleeding Hollow orcs do blood magic - like voodoo but it hurt more. They cut their own flesh. Most of 'em carry curved ritual blades for carvin' themselves up. Bring me them blades, commander. We can turn their power against 'em. 
Speak with Vivianne.	Burning Beauty	Before you go, there is someone you should meet. She might set some of your stuff on fire, but I believe she's the best mage this side of Draenor. She belongs on the front lines with you, commander. 
Retrieve Ishaal's Orb from Camp Thornscar.	Ishaal's Orb	The Adherents came for me, but I was already hiding. I watched from the shadows as they ransacked my hut. Then I watched the Shattered Hand orcs arrive and butcher them like dinner fowl. Seems everyone is after us these days. One of those orc thugs made off with my scrying orb. I will be needing it back if I am to be of any use to Iskar. 
Locate Rangari Eleena at Mar'gok's Overwatch.	Trouble at the Overwatch	Ya know, we sent a couple o' scouts ta check out those big, smelly, 'civilized' ogres at Mar'gok's Overwatch. Haven't heard from 'em in a bit. Matter o' fact, not since I saved yer bacon up at Telaar. Have some time ta ride over there and check up on 'em, <boyo/girly>? 
Retrieve the Feather of Syth and the Saga of Terokk.	All Due Respect	A group of Adherents came 'round just before the attack on Skettis. Disguised myself as a mushroom, I did. The fools walked right past me. My neighbor up the road was not so lucky. He had a fondness for texts, if I recall. Might be valuable information in his hut, if you give Reshad a moment to rummage around. Oh, and bring one of his feathers to the shrine near Veil Terokk, would you? He was such a dear, and I know it's what he'd want. 
Collect the All-Seeing Ring from Ogzor the Necrothurge.	Eye Need That	The Mother of Wolves was infected with demon magic. The Shadow Council must have hoped to spread the corruption to the other frost wolves and then to Throm'var. The hunters are reporting they've seen glowing green eyes down in the Icescar Boneyard to the west. We both know what that means. I have an idea... we're going to use the Shadow Council's ""eyes"" against them to reveal their base. All we need is the lead warlock's All-Seeing Ring. 
Collect 6 Iron Horde Explosives.	In Short Supply	The Iron Horde has explosive devices stored throughout the heart of their logging camp. We must recover them so they are not used against us. I will keep an eye on Maraad... I worry for him in his anger. 
Deliver the Prophet's Arcanum to Prophet Velen's Memorial beneath the Coliseum of Light in Shadowmoon Valley.	The Prophet's Final Message	This unassuming iridescent crystal contains some of the final thoughts of Great Prophet Velen, created sometime in the hours before he confronted Ner'zhul. Deliver the crystal to Prophet Velen's Memorial beneath the Coliseum of Light near Karabor to hear his final message. 
Chris Clarkie in Stormshield wants you to kill 5 members of the Horde within the Road of Glory.	The Road of Glory	The Horde intends to force us out of Ashran, George. We can't let them succeed. March into the Road of Glory and thin their ranks by at least five. 
Collect 5 Laughing Skull Masks.	We Die Laughing!	Are you here to help or hinder? This village is being eaten, and we must move quickly to salvage what we can. Gather the masks of our fallen Laughing Skull brothers and sisters and meet me on the western side of the village. I will need them if our clan is to rebuild. 
Burn the corpses of dead Frostwolf Outriders.	A Proper Parting	The ogres outnumbered us, *cough* but we made them pay for their deeds in blood. Even so, I was forced to abandon my fallen brothers and sisters on the battlefield. They deserve better than to have their corpses despoiled by the ogre filth. Here, take this torch *cough* and do what I could not: burn the corpses of my fallen brothers and sisters to the west. 
Slay 5 Shadeback Ravagers and the Shadeback Thornmother.	Mother of Thorns	<Beneath Skizzik's outstretched hand, letters are scrawled into the dirt:t h o r nm o t h e rRavagers brought in by the Shattered Hand have taken over the aviary and are breeding fast. If left alone, they could be swarming the entire area - including Veil Terokk - in a matter of days.> 
Slay 25 Thunderlord orcs in Grom'gar.	Karg Unchained	They took my brothers and sisters. They took my wolf.<Karg lifts his axe and fixes his gaze upon its edge.>Now we take their heads. 
Bring the Glowing Red Pod to Grulkor at Crimson Fen.	Mysterious Pod	This pod is similar to the ones growing on or near the bodies around here, except this one is pulsating weirdly. Grulkor might know more about this. 
Destroy 8 Pollen Pods.	Chapter I: Plant Food	There are strange, glowing objects within Tangleheart, seemingly pollinated by a variety of stinging creature. The botani sometimes collect whatever the pods produce. I can't be sure what it is, but it might be dangerous to us.- Frenna 
	The Portal Home	[Ph] Khadgar is willing to open a portal to Azeroth, if only briefly, to get some of those we need to secure our foothold here. 
Kill 8 denizens of the wasteland in Affliction Ridge.	A Harsh Reminder	Welcome to the front lines, outsider, where the wastelands and the jungle collide. When their forces forget about the ferocity of the Laughing Skull, this is where we come to make them remember. By fierce and merciless destruction we survive. This is the way of Gorgrond. Join in! Let us see if you can withstand the brutality of our land. 
Take the trophy to Maraad at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Crater Lord Igneous	Defeating Crater Lord Igneous has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim. Take this to Maraad at Highpass. 
Speak with Exarch Othaar in Elodor.	The Exarch Council	Good work at the gates! The Shadowmoon orcs have been seeking prisoners for some reason. Their aggression helps our cause. Come with me. I would like to introduce you to the Exarch Council, ""The Hand of the Prophet."" I have been trying to convince the Exarchs to support our cause and go on the offensive against the Iron Horde, but they are - as always - too cautious and slow to act. Come with me, I will introduce you to Exarch Othaar up the hill. Perhaps meeting an Alliance hero can sway the council. 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	Blood Oath of Na'Shra	You have done me a great service. This blade is as much yours as it is mine. I offer you this blood oath: I shall serve your cause and lend my knowledge of blades and mining to your forces. Will you accept it? 
Collect 15 crates of Drudgeboat Salvage.	Ship Salvage	Commander, we are running low on supplies. Maybe we can salvage materials from that ship you arrived on? At the rate folks are coming through the portal we are going to be out of everything by sundown... or moondown? I'm still getting used to this place. 
Slay Vizier Vorgorsh, Vizier Zulmork, and Vizier Cromaug.	Punching Through	To secure the fortress we need to kill Witch Lord Morkurk, but I don't think we should go straight after him. His three lieutenants - Vorgorsh, Zulmork, and Cromaug - are all powerful mages, and all of them are fiercely loyal to Morkurk. I suspect that if we engage the Witch Lord that they will rush to his aid. Let's take them out so that cannot happen. 
	A Few Artifact Fragments	 
Retrieve Mo'mor's Holy Hammer.	... and My Hammer	When they captured me, the Warsong took my hammer. Will you help me to recover it? I ask only because it's a holy relic. It should be taken from these orc dogs for no other reason than to return it to Auchindoun. Perhaps then, a worthy vindicator of the Light will take it up to smite the enemies of the draenei. 
	Kuuro's Claim	 
Go to the Shamanstone in Wor'gol and receive a blessing.	Honor Has Its Rewards	You have honored my people. Now, we wish to honor you. We have a rite of initiation in my clan. When one comes of age, they cover themselves in the blood of their first hunt, and rest their hands upon a shamanstone to honor the ancestors who came before them. In our brief time together you have already slain many foes more fierce than our hunters have ever had to face. Go, touch the shamanstone here in Wor'gol, and join our pack as an equal. 
Speak with Vindicator Yrel at Yrel's Watch.	Along the Riverside	Vindicator Yrel has taken most of our forces north. She's establishing a forward base along the Skysong River. She'll want to know that we're almost ready to move against Grommashar. I'm sure she can also use your help dealing with the Warsong orcs at Lok-rath. 
Speak to Mixxy Weldblast in Murkbog.	Best Deals Anywhere	Commander, two goblin smugglers - Mixxy and Trixxy Weldblast - came through here recently and went off towards the bog to the east. They had drilling equipment but weren't carrying any weapons, <sir/madame>. I'd bet anything that they'll have materials we'd want, and that they could use some protection in return. Commander, I think seeking them out would be a good idea. 
Kill 8 Shadowmoon Raiders or Dark Priestesses.	Defenstrations	No sooner does power rush to the crystal outside than you hear distant war cries and shouts of alarm. Elodor is being attacked! If you want your laborers to come home in one piece, you'd best help with the defense of the town. Defeat the invasion and then return to the control console to reset the defenses. 
Meet Lady Liadrin at Sunsworn Camp in Talador.	Sunsworn Camp	We no longer have a need to work alongside the Auchenai, champion. I have arranged for their lead soulbinders to continue to advise us, but I believe any action is best left to us at this point. Meet me at Sunsworn Camp, southeast of here. I can sense more demonic taint in the area, and we may be able to track down the remaining power crystal shards at its source. 
	Vindicator Onaala	 
Help Magister Serena destroy 3 Gordunni Boulderthrowers.	Dropping In	Witch Lord Morkurk, the leader of the fortress, has catapults set up along the road into their compound. That won't be a problem for us. Take out the ogres around the catapults and mark them for me. This vortex spell I have prepared will handle the rest. We'll meet at the gate to the fortress once the catapults are gone. 
Shoot Penny's Flare Gun while in Deadgrin.	A Flare for the Dramatic	I received a strange object with a note attached. Here, it seems to be written in your tongue, commander.<Dear Mister Durotan,I'm Penny... you know, from Azeroth? We met briefly back at $p's garrison. Anyway, like I told you, I have a fifth degree black hammer in engineering and I'm eager to serve. The more danger the better! You just fire this old flare whenever you're in trouble and I'll be there, quick as a quark! Hopefully,Penny> 
	Vignette: Iron Houndmaster	 
Recover 100 Quenching Waters from Steamfury elementals.	On the Mend	Nisha will heal. This ordeal has taken a toll on her. She needs water and rest. I will bring her to my camp and make her comfortable. Will you meet us there with some fresh water? 
Slay Kuhlrath and 10 Warsong shaman.	Silence the Call	The Warsong clan, in their lust for dominance, have turned to the darkness of the void for power. Dark shamanism is a loathsome, dangerous practice that abuses the elemental gift I have bestowed upon them. There is one among the Warsong that calls out the loudest to the void, an elder shaman named Kuhlrath. Slay him and the rest of his dark shaman. I will not allow the Warsong to abuse the elements and desecrate tradition. 
Compel the All-Seeing Eye.	Ominous Portents	Now that Priestess Moonfang has created the blessed water, it is time to deal with the demon. Take the water and the scripture of Elune. Through the power of each, you will compel the demon to show us what the orcs are up to at Gul'var. 
Use Gul'dan's Soul Trap on Gul'dan.	To Catch a Shadow	Gul'dan is on the Shadow Rise just up the hill to the west. But, you must hurry, George. We know that he's about to leave for Talador and Frostfire Ridge. The use of the soul trap is straightforward. Simply point and shoot to ensnare Gul'dan. The crystal will take care of the rest. I'll see you back at Starfall Outpost when you have him. Good luck. 
Collect 100 Ancient Growth Sap from botani or ancients within Tangleheart.	Growing Wood	I found this dwarf, Thuldren, runnin' out of Tangleheart like his boots were on fire. Says his mole machine showed up here and he barely made it out alive. And another called Frenna might still be inside. One useful thing he told me is that the creatures in there have sap that can be used to grow things real fast. By the way, I'm gonna go lookin' for Thuldren's mole machine. Find me in Tangleheart when you're done. 
Collect the Mother of Wolves' Remains and bury it at the graveyard outside of northern Throm'var.	What Must Be Done	I believe we have seen this demonic corruption your friends speak of. The Mother of Wolves has not been herself lately. Now, her pack has her surrounded. The wolves are protecting our hunters and will not let them near. They're not likely to stop you, though. If the alpha mother is infected with this fel-energy, then she must be put down. You would greatly honor the Frostwolves by returning with her corpse and giving it a proper burial. 
Confront Gul'dan.	To Capture Gul'dan	Gul'dan is in the cave further into the Gloomspire. We know that he's about to leave for Talador and Shadowmoon Valley. You must capture him by any means necessary, George. I'll see you back at Throm'var. Good luck. 
Follow Grulkor deeper into the Crimson Fen and deal with what comes.	Heart of the Fen	If only the trees here weren't screaming at me I could concentrate better. Never mind, they are only trees. This spot is used up but now I can feel a much stronger presence deeper in the marsh. I will go there now and take what is rightfully mine! Then I will share it... with everyone... 
Slay Ranjit, Araknath, Rukhran and High Sage Viryx in the Skyreach dungeon.	Victory is Within Reach	We have dealt a crippling blow to the Adherents, but our fight is not yet finished. Gather your allies and prepare for the final siege on Skyreach!""Shadows gather when the raven swallows the day. Burning sky is extinguished as black wings fold gently about the heavens. Rest, my children, rest. For even the sun must sleep.""This was Rukhmar's lullaby, sung by her to the first arakkoa. My, how we've lost our way. 
	Vignette/Treasure: Lagoon Pool/Giant Clam	 
Confront Kaelynara Sunchaser.	Kaelynara Sunchaser	The focusing crystal is complete, George. When you are ready I will use the crystal to shatter Kaelynara's shield. However, it is unsafe to confront her within the mine. The moment her shield is down I will teleport us to a safe location outside of the Jorune Mine. She will be much easier to deal with when she is far away from the crystal. Speak with me when you are ready to begin. 
Collect 6 Shattrath Guardian Maces from Gordunni Bashers or Gordunni Cleavers within Gordal Fortress.	Prized Repossessions	The Gordunni have plagued the people of Shattrath ever since the city was founded. Over time they amassed quite a hoard of weapons they captured from our defenders in raids. Getting these weapons in the hands of our soldiers would be practical and I personally would like to get them out of the hands of the ogres. While we are in here can you do me a favor and gather up any of those weapons you come across. 
Gather the Head of Thunk, the Head of Gullok, and the Head of Splorg.	The Warlord's Guard	I don't know what you are accustomed to, traveler, but these lands devour the weak. Perhaps Durotan wishes to rid himself of you. We shall see. You must kill the Warlord of the Circle of Blood. Do this and the ogres here will be defeated. But first, you must find him. I have located his bodyguards nearby. Slay them and bring me their heads. With them, we shall lure the Warlord into the open. 
Slay Malrok Thornscar in Veil Akraz.	Blades in the Dark	Those orcs got hold of Ishaal's orb, did they? That would explain the dangerous-looking fellow who crossed into this realm shortly before you. Not everyone handles the transition as... gracefully as you did. The oaf is still grappling with his own mind, stumbling about and muttering nonsense. Soon he will be drawn to the orb again, which would presumably lead him to Veil Terokk. Better to take him out now while he's still befuddled. 
Find Farseer Drek'Thar at the Throne of Elements.	The Farseer Awaits	Your presence has been requested at the Throne of Elements, George. Farseer Drek'Thar heard the call of the furies upon the wind and made the journey to commune with the elements. The Farseer has sent word that you are to join him at the Throne of Elements. Go and see what the elements would have of you. 
Collapse 6 Void Portals.	The Nether Approaches	By connecting with the Twisting Nether, the Warsong shaman have created a ripple effect that they could not have anticipated. Look around and you will see countless portals beginning to open, signs that the Twisting Nether seeks to connect to Draenor. Should these portals successfully open, the path will be clear for all manner of demons and void creatures to rampage across this valley. 
Look for weaponization orders at the Iron Horde camp in Crushfang's End.	Iron Horde Orders	Spirit spotted some orders at the Iron Horde camp on the nearby bluff. You must have missed them when you were there. Could you look into it? 
Collect Corrupted Lumber from a Twisted Ancient.	Bounty: Twisted Ancient	The ancients of the Cursed Woods have been corrupted by demonic magic. Since they need to be destroyed, we might as well make use of their resources. Waste not, want not. Beware: these woodland behemoths are no easy targets. Gather trusted friends before you engage these twisted ancients.-- Baros Alexston 
Spy on the Shadow Council.	All is Revealed	Tell me when you're ready. We'll invoke the power of the ring to summon one of their 'eyes.' Through it, we'll discover where the Shadow Council is located and what they're really up to. 
Speak to Filbert Tinkertoss in Murkbog.	The Tinkertoss Twins	Commander, two gnomish smugglers passed by while you were out - Filbert and Dilbert Tinkertoss. They were headed towards the bog to the east. They had all sorts of drilling equipment but didn't seem to have any weapons. What do you think of offering them protection in exchange for some of their materials? I'll jot down where they were headed in case you decide to go. 
Pick 5 Lunarblossoms.	Lunarblossom	How I long to hold Kat'la. No star or moon can compare to her beauty. Alas, I am but a simple boar farmer. If only I could find time to sneak away from this pathetic excuse for a job and pick some lunarblossoms for Kat'la. I wouldn't dare confess my love to her without a gift. 
	South Gronn Canyon	 
	Brimstone Springs	 
	Vault of the Wardens	 
	Assault on the Everbloom Wilds	 
Destroy the Portal to Highmaul.	Removing the Reinforcements	My own investigations have uncovered a permanent arcane portal from here to Highmaul itself. It is guarded but shouldn't be too hard to disrupt once you've gotten some breathing room. 
Collect the Horn of Banthar from Banthar.	Queen of the Clefthoof	Laara told me that they have Banthar here! Or rather, that she's still alive back now. Did what I just said make any sense? This is our chance, commander. We can defeat a younger, more powerful version of Banthar and really stick it to these rangari. We'll show Laara how a true professional works. 
Kill 4 Ancients.	Chapter III: Ritual of the Charred	I have seen a strange ritual performed by ancients. They step into fire, burning the leaves from their branches and charring their bark. I call it the Ritual of the Charred. If we want to weaken the ancients, we can get rid of them before they become even stronger.- Frenna 
Collect 9 Basilisk Meat from Stoneshamble Basilisks or Decaying Basilisks.	Basilisk Butcher	Basilisk is one of Nisha's favorite meals. This is where she hunts, and that's likely how those Iron Horde bastards were able to capture her. Why would they go to the trouble to subdue her this way? Perhaps together, you and I might learn the answer as we punish them for their transgressions. For now, Nisha's going to need some food. While I tend to her, will you do her hunting for her? 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	The Fists of Vaandaam	You have done me a great service. This blade is as much yours as it is mine. I offer you this blood oath: I shall serve your cause and lend my knowledge of blades and mining to your forces. Will you accept it? 
	Artificer Romuul	 
	Court of Souls	 
Kill a Night Elf Player in Player versus Player combat while in Draenor and retrieve their Night Elf Heart.	Nemesis: Becoming Death	You have chosen your quarry and surely soon they will feel your merciless wrath, but first you must venture out into the wilds of Draenor and rip out the still-beating heart of a night elf in mortal combat. Return here with your prize. Through the heart of your enemy the spirits will attune your senses, granting you second sight and keenness in hearing - all to stalk your prey and claim dominance. 
Follow the clue to find the Frozen Shamanstone and receive the Blessing of Frost.	Gronnsbane: The Blessing of Frost	The weapon has been imbued with the Blessing of Fire, drawing power from the Molten Shamanstone. The Frozen Shamanstone should impart the next blessing. Argoram mentions its location in his journal:""As I was maneuvering away from the great boulders hurled at me by the ogron brutes, I glanced what looked like another monolith atop the tallest of the snow-capped towers in Bloodmaul. Perhaps this is the Frozen Shamanstone, which is thought to grant the Blessing of Frost"" 
Collect 8 Gordunni Runebeads.	While We're in the Neighborhood	Ah, the hubris of ogres. It always backfires. Morkurk has been using enchanted bracelets to empower his minions with arcane strength. We can disenchant these bracelets into reagents that will no doubt be useful to your arcane sanctum. What do you think about collecting some while we're here? 
	Aktar's Post	 
Rescue Nazgrel.	Nazgrel	Escaping Stonemaul was the easy part. The ogre filth that rule the pits still have my son. For a while they used him as leverage to ensure I would fight in their arenas. But now that I have escaped they will try to train him to replace me. Please, rescue my son. If they see me they will kill him instantly. 
Ask Draka to sound the war horn.	Rally the Frostwolves	My brother, in his haste, has already taken some of my clan with him and has begun an assault on Bladespire Citadel before we were ready. Draka awaits by our war horn. Please let her know that it is time to rally the clan! With the aid of you and your forces, we might actually stand a chance at victory against the ogres. 
Kill 10 Grom'kar Grunts.	Nisha's Vengeance	Since I left on my last hunt, the Iron Horde have drawn nearer and reinforced their positions.<A grin spreads across Rexxar's lips.>They've created a target-rich environment. I must continue nursing Nisha to health for now. You go in my stead, friend. Fill them with the fear and pain that they inflicted on her. Make their screams fill the canyon! 
Kill 5 Botani.	Botani Beatdown	Gidwin is doing much better. Thank you, George. I can't believe the draenei have lived alongside those horrible monsters for so long. Maybe we should show these beasts what happens when you mess with an Azerothian. 
Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Gronnling Scale	This scale is proof of your strength at slaying ogron and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the scale back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
Speak with Azik in the Spires of Arak.	Hero's Call: Spires of Arak!	All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Azik in Spires of Arak. There have been wingless arakkoa seen fleeing from Spires of Arak. Rumors suggest that they are running from an Iron Horde superweapon. We need to find out what is causing them to leave their homeland, and why their wings have withered. Glory to the Alliance! 
Harvest 3 Arcane Vortexes in Zangarra.	Gathering the Spark	We need to get our hands on arcane energy to complete our scroll. It needs that fiery kick. I have a device capable of capturing energy in the space below, so let's get moving. The infused creatures shouldn't be an issue for the two of us. 
Defeat Witch Lord Morkurk and retrieve the Arcane Nexus in Gordal Fortress.	The Final Step	We have Morkurk cornered. He's all ours now. Use the scroll once you engage Morkurk......and enjoy the blizzard of your forces raining down on his head. 
Defeat Riplash while riding your Boar-In-Training.	Boar Training: Riplash	This boar is at home in the rocky plains of Gorgrond, so it will be easier to train. As with other beasts, we will begin the training in the place it calls home. Test your boar against the great predator Riplash, a raptor known to hunt boars. 
Rescue ""Tillik"" from the beast Stonescale in Gnarlwood Pass.	To the... Rescue?	The Parchment of Dust reads: ""Put the featherless against one another so that our claws remain unsullied!"" How wise the high Ravenspeaker is to foresee this day. There is a great beast on the hillside to the west by the name of Stonescale. It has abducted one of the flock and despite our many attempts we have been unable to defeat it. Go, prove yourself by slaying the beast and rescuing Tillik! Fulfill your destiny in the name of the Raven Mother! 
Find Orac and tell him to return home to his uncle.	Young Hearts	My nephew never pays attention to his surroundings. In his eagerness to prove himself, he has strayed from the pack -- again. He reminds me of myself when I was a youngling. If you see Orac, tell him to return home. We need to finish preparing for tomorrow's hunt. 
Place Lithic's Gift on the Effigy of Terokk.	The Missing Piece	Terokk's daughter Lithic was a skilled huntress, but found her true passion in goldsmithing. She forged this bangle as a gift for her father, and he wore it for many years. Only after Lithic passed away did he remove the bangle, for her memory was too much for the old king to bear. Place the bangle upon the effigy, and I shall tell you of Terokk's fall. 
	The Shimmer Moor	 
Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Basilisk Scale	This scale is proof of your strength at slaying basilisks and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the scale back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
	Tracking Quest: Treasure Map	 
	Valley of Destruction	 
	Garrison Follower: Greatmother Geyah	 
Kill 15 Warsong forces at Telaar.	Operation: Just Arrowhead	It goes without saying that we'll help you kill any of the Warsong out in the open down there. You just start the fight, and we'll end it with extreme prejudice. 
	Sparring Arena	 
Speak to Sir Edward at Admiral Taylor's Garrison.	Second in Command	Wait... I remember something else. Sir Edward... he was shouting... looking for someone. I... I can't remember who. There were so many screams... 
Speak to Exarch Naielle in the Rangari Enclave.	Naielle, The Rangari	I am calling the Exarch Council to order to hear your petition. None of us doubt that this ""Iron Horde"" is a threat, but few can agree on what we should do about it. It is up to you and Vindicator Maraad to gather the Exarchs together. Exarch Naielle is the leader of the Rangari, the ""Eyes of the Prophet."" They are our scouts who silently stalk the farthest corners of Draenor. Seek her out in the Rangari Enclave northwest of here. 
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.	Riverbeast Training: The Garn	The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land. The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them. There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your riverbeast, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your riverbeast will truly be ready. 
Speak to Soulbinder Tuulani outside Telmor.	Scheduled Pickup	You've proven yourself more than capable in battle, George. As you know, there may be Shadow Council forces anywhere around Auchindoun, including near Telmor. Tuulani's powers as a soulpriest have not yet fully manifested; she isn't capable of protecting the shard alone. I need you to join her at Telmor to make sure the crystal makes it to Auchindoun safely. 
	Treasure: Ogre Booty 000	 
Defeat Ironbore while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.	Riverbeast Training: Ironbore	You have defeated foes in the sky and on land, and even in the rain. Next, you face beasts beneath your very feet. The rockworm is a cunning predator, striking at prey from below the sands. Many beasts of Nagrand have grown wary of the rumbling of the earth. Take your mount on out to the sandy shores test it against the elder worm Ironbore. 
Gather 30 Pulsating Pustules from Sporebats and Fungal Giants in Zangarra.	Creating the Ink	We need a way to create an artificial nexus at your tower. I know where we can get the conduit to do that, but it's well-guarded. We need to keep our cool and do this the right way. I have a plan - a scroll of mass teleportation. The fungal giants and shamblers down below are covered with pustules full of an oily substance. We can use the oil to craft a makeshift ink substitute for the scroll. 
	Sealing Fate: Stockpiled Garrison Resources	 
	Delvar Ironfist	 
Kristen Stoneforge wants you to collect 25 Iron Horde Scraps.	Scrap Meltdown	We've had a breakthrough in melting down the scraps you've been collecting! If you can get me a small pile of 'em, we can get your troops something a bit more useful. 
Kill Grondo in the Crackling Plains.	WANTED: Grondo's Bounty	Grondo, a mad gronn, has been seen roaming the Crackling Plains. This beast has been killing entire herds of clefthoof and devouring innocent frost wolves. We must destroy this threat before it reaches the Garrison. 
Search for Shivertail's parents in Frostfire Ridge.	Shivertail's Den	The Frostwolf pup looks at you with his big eyes. He howls and stares into the cave. It's unusual for a wolf this young to be wandering around by itself. Shivertail's parents must be nearby. 
Collect Enriched Seeds.	Super Seeds	These seeds have been shielded with care by the botani. Great power can be felt surging out of these tiny vessels of life. These may prove useful. 
	Mistcreep Mire	 
	Tracking: Arena Treasure 15	 
Defeat Riplash while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.	Clefthoof Training: Riplash	Many beasts will cower in fear at the sight of a mighty predator. In the desolate cliffs of Gorgrond lives one of the most fierce. It will prove your next challenge. Take your beast to the nest of the great Riplash, and see if you cannot emerge victorious. 
Speak with Lieutenant Kragil.	Warspear Welcome	Lieutenant Kragil said you might be showing up. I've been ordered to take you to the inn. 
Defeat Hol'yelaa in the Ring of Trials.	Ring of Trials: Hol'yelaa	You won your first two fights, but it's only going to get tougher from here! Your next fight is against Hol'yelaa, a former rangari who is as crazy as they come. No, really... Hol'yelaa is bonkers! Years ago, while on a scouting mission, he single handedly saved his entire rangari unit from a pack of Garn. But something inside of him snapped....It wasn't long before Hol'yelaa went completely marbles and turned on his own unit! Alright, the pep talk is over! Get in there and kick some ass! 
	The Honor of a Blademaster	 
Address Uruk Foecleaver at Lok-rath.	Terms of Surrender	I have good news, commander: we've already taken Lok-rath.<The warchief grins.>The Horde's soldiers have captured most of the Warsong, including their leader, Uruk Foecleaver. I saved the honor of accepting his surrender for you. They're waiting for you inside, commander. 
Find Rangari Rajess, Rangari Kolaan, and Rangari Jonaa.	Rescue Rangari	Many of our rangari have not been accounted for. It would seem the followers of Iyu have taken captives. We will continue to search the area for survivors. In the meantime, follow the Wildwood Wash west toward Highpass and look for any signs of our rangari comrades. Our people are stout and capable survivors. You may find more than you expect. Have them stay near the road and we will follow as soon as this... dwarf creature... has fixed his mechanical vessel. 
Destroy $1oa Goren Egg Clusters, $2oa Iceforge Ironchewers, and Broodmother Reeg'ak.	Vignette: Broodmother Reeg'ak	Goren are dangerous, especially in large numbers, and especially when we have a blind, under powered shaman with us. Fortunately, they have very short lifespans. Unfortunately, they multiply fast and grow faster. If we are going to do this we need to find the brood mother. Slaying her and her eggs should slow down the onslaught of goren. Check the burrows near the Forge Gates and I will to keep them off of Drek'Thar's scent. 
Speak with Bony Xuk to observe him communing with Gro the Uncreator.	Zero Xuks Given	The spirits have spoken to me. They believe the magnaron, Gro the Uncreator, will join our fight and lead his underlings against the Iron Horde. This is an honor beyond any bestowed upon a Laughing Skull, at least in my time. I will commune with the magnaron, and together we shall destroy the Iron Horde. 
Destroy 7 Summoning Circles.	Stop the Flow	The Shadow Council down in the boneyard are going to have magic circles. It's not enough to simply kill them; we also have to eliminate their infernal devices. If you destroy the circles, you'll stop the flow of demons they're summoning to inhabit the bones of the dead. 
Retrieve 10 Mysterious Artifacts.	A Lesson in Teamwork	One of the most important skills an archaeology team needs is good teamwork. The key to teamwork is knowing when to give and when to take. The Highmaul ogres have been excavating mysterious artifacts from the gorge. I want you to team up with the Highmaul ogres in the name of good archaeology! Remember what I said about giving and taking? The ogres have given us their hard work to excavate the artifacts. Now I want you to take those artifacts from them and bring them here! It's teamwork! 
Use a Burning Log to cauterize Nisha's wounds.	Cauterizing Wounds	You have saved my most precious companion, Nisha. I owe you a great debt. The Iron Horde lured me away to separate us. I shall not make the same mistake again. They have inflicted grievous wounds, and I fear we must cause her even more pain before the healing process can begin. Please use a burning log from the nearby fire to cauterize her wounds. I will hold her down. 
Speak with Exarch Hataaru outside of the Elodor Dig.	Hataaru, the Artificer	I will also need you to call upon Exarch Hataaru. I understand you were helping him with our defenses at the gate. Hataaru is our Chief Artificer - he understands our technology better than any other and has been working tirelessly to recreate the glory of the civilization we left behind. He has moved to his workstation outside of the Elodor Dig, our crystal mines located just to the Southeast. Look for him at the mine entrance. 
Search Loose Mud for Old Loola's husband.	Loola's Lost Love	Oh it was horrible. My husband and I were fishing in the marsh, I fell asleep and when I woke up he had been turned into a toad! I'm sure it was one of those Shadowmoon orcs I hear so much about. He jumped into the muddy waters before I could catch him. Will you help me find my lost love, Mechanic? 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	Defection of Gronnstalker Rokash	You have done me a great service. This blade is as much yours as it is mine. I offer you this blood oath: I shall serve your cause and lend my knowledge of blades and mining to your forces. Will you accept it? 
	Treasure: Shadowmoon Treasure 01	 
	Treasure: Ogre Booty 002	 
Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Wasp Stinger	This stinger is proof of your strength at slaying ancients and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the stinger back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
Take the proof to Rangari Jonaa at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Elemental Crystal	This crystal is proof of your strength at slaying elementals and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the crystal back to Jonaa and claim your accolades! 
Assault the Shadow Council forces at the Ruins of Kra'nak in Tanaan Jungle.	Assault on the Ruins of Kra'nak	The Shadow Council have recruited the Sethekk and other power hungry Arakkoa to their service. Our allies in the Order of the Awakened have tracked them to a ruin in the west of Tanaan where the Shadow Council is instructing them in the use of fel magic. We must strike at them before they can master their diabolic powers. 
Collect 8 Unrefined Draenic Crystals from the mines located within the Temple of Sha'naar in Tanaan Jungle.	Disarming Sha'naar	Draenei at the Temple of Sha'naar would mine these mountains for perfect crystals to power our arcane devices. Sadly, the temple is lost to us - we have been betrayed by the Sargerei. George, it is imperative that you venture into those mines and secure those crystals before the Sargerei use them in their demonic rituals. If you must kill our former brothers and sisters, so be it. 
	Sealing Fate: Piles of Gold	 
Use the Boar Lasso on a Young Rocktusk and follow it until it is tamed.	Besting a Boar	Have you seen the boars they have here? Bigger than I am! Let's get one of them, why not? You're going to have to head to Gorgrond for that task. Way out in the desolate regions, you'll find the ones we're lookin' for. 
Collect 30 Putrid Brown Ogre Teeth.	Need More Teeth	<Prowler Sasha silently holds out his hand to reveal a necklace crafted of stained leather and putrid brown ogre teeth. All have a matching tone of rot to them.><It has several knots that appear to be missing additional teeth.> 
Speak with Igrimar the Resolute at the Circle of Blood.	Mopping Up	We've won the day, but our work here is far from finished. Frostwolves will scour the citadel and root out any survivors. To you, I offer the glory of cleansing the gladiator pits to the north. As we launched our attack, we dispatched one of our best to recon that area. If you still thirst for blood, join her there. There's surely some sport left. 
Defeat Gezz'ran while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.	Talbuk Training: Gezz'ran	There's plenty more beasts out in the wild that can make a snack of your favorite mount. One of the most cunning on Draenor is the stalker. Stalkers can blend into their environments, allowing them to sneak in and steal the eggs of nearby prey. See if you and your talbuk can't overcome this natural defense mechanism. You'll find some mean stalkers out in Talador. 
	Service of Rangari Kaalya	 
Destroy 6 Iron Horde Siege Engines.	Iron Them Out	The orcs themselves are not the only threat. We may have weakened them considerably, but they still have siege weapons of significant power. Sabotage siege weapons you find with the explosives you collected from the beach. 
Retrieve 6 Arcane Essence.	Arcane Essence	Kaelynara's lust for arcane power has consumed her and she threatens the safety of all in this mine. She must be stopped. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do while she shields herself. We will need to find a way to penetrate her shielding spell. Perhaps if I were to build a focusing crystal, I could use it to lower her shield...I'll need you to search the crystal mine for the necessary components. First, I'll need arcane essence from the Crystal Ragers and Arcane Wraiths in the mine. 
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Boar-In-Training.	Boar Training: The Garn	The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land. The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them. There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your boar, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your boar will truly be ready. 
Burn a Nemesis Effigy at the Gladiator's Sanctum then speak to Kuros.	Nemesis: Hunter - Hunted	Our enemies surround us, and with each passing day their numbers grow. It is time to make a decisive strike against their armies, champion. Around me stand effigies of our most hated adversaries. You will be their downfall, George. You will become nemesis and they will run in fear at the sight of you. Now select the target of your rage and burn in effigy that race which you mean to eradicate. Speak to me when you have made your selection. 
Collect 4 Earthen Cores.	A Lesson in Mineralogy	<Gazmolf gestures at the large machine nearby.>I built this machine to break down elementium minerals into base elements. You see, it's not just what's buried within the ground that can be valuable; but also the ground itself! Take, for example, the earth elementals below us; inside every earth elemental is an earthen core, dense in precious metal!. Those elementals are going to make us rich! Collect several earthen cores, place them in the Gold-O-Matic 9000, and I'll give you a cut! 
Gather 8 Ravager Grubs in the Shadowglade.	Baby Bird	<Ikky cheeps again, then begins gnawing on his foot. Looking out across the nearby hillside, you spy tiny ravager grubs inching along the grass.> 
Use the Eye of Anzu on 8 Cursed Arakkoa.	Banished From the Sky	The Adherents have been casting their enemies into the hollow for generations. The pools carry Sethe's dying curse, crippling arakkoa with visions of darkness and intense pain. The mind reels, the body writhes, and the wings wither. Most arakkoa die or go insane. Only the strongest can resist - seek them out and use the Eye of Anzu to help them to their senses. Beware, for the worshippers of Sethe also prey on these survivors to fill their ranks. 
Collect 12 strange	Spores Galore	Chuck goes over again how the jungle seems to be alive and all wrong. He asks you to recover the spores that are on the fungarians and the beasts they've infected. Chuck is worried whatever is happening isn't natural. 
Destroy the Ritual Totems.	Disrupt the Rituals	No longer do the Warsong seek to be one with the elements; instead they abuse their power by using it to channel the darkness of the void. I will not tolerate these rituals to continue. Locate the ritual totems the Warsong use to channel the void and destroy them. The gift of the elements was not given to the orcs only to be defiled and used as a plaything. 
Destroy the Central, Northern, and Southern Shrouding Stones.	Shrouding Stones	Long ago, the shaman of the Shadowmoon clan erected three stones in the woods. There, they performed their sacred rituals, blessing the beasts and the trees. Now, someone has placed a fel magic upon those stones. This corruption is what shrouds the village of Gul'var. Before we can use the captured demon to safely peer into the Shadow Council's village, we must bring down those stones. 
Speak with Gazlowe at your Garrison in Frostfire Ridge	The Bounty of Bladespire	The sacking of this fortress is as much your victory as ours. It is only fair you should share in the bounty. I will have resources set aside as we find them. All you need do is report to your garrison and have them dispatch peons to collect these materials. 
	Vignette: Anchorite's Sojourn	 
	Tracking: Mill Treasure 8	 
Defeat Ironbore while riding your Snarler-In-Training.	Wolf Training: Ironbore	Alright, we've taken on foes in the sky and on land, and even in the rain. What happens when the beasts are below your feet, though? We're about to find out! The rockworm is a cunning predator, striking at prey from below the sands. Many beasts of Nagrand have grown wary of the rumbling of the earth. Take your wolf on out to the sandy shores and see if you can't take down one of the elder rockworms: Ironbore. 
Use the Gathered Pebbles to pop the Slumberblooms.	Slumberbloom	Huh?... Oh my, I appear to have fallen asleep again. These slumberblooms are nothing but trouble. One second I'm fighting botani and the next I'm dreaming I'm an elekk dancing with riverbeasts.*Yawn* We really should do something about all these slumberbloo *Yawn* ... ZZZZzzzzzzzz<You gather a small handful of pebbles laying by the sleeping draenei.> 
Harvest a Timber Sample from Large Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.	Tree-i-cide	Commander, your engineers have brought you a present. They call it the Wood Annihilator XXI the Third, Jr. What's it do? I reckon it annihilates trees - but more importantly it will allow for the harvesting of large timber. Do you know how much timber a large tree holds? Me neither, but I bet it's a lot! There's a large piece of timber ready to be annihilated nearby. Why don't you give the contraption a test run? Bring me back whatever it harvests and I'll put it to good use. 
	A TON of Artifact Fragments	 
Speak with Foreman Grobash in Talador.	Warchief's Command: Talador!	All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Foreman Grobash in Talador. The Iron Horde seek to control Talador. The area is perfect to send reinforcements to any other part of Draenor quickly and without resistance. Foreman Grobash is currently establishing an outpost in Talador. Travel there and stop the Iron Horde. For the Horde! 
Enter the Spirit Realm and destroy the Memory of Arumel.	Aruumel's Rest	It is my job to see what others cannot. I keep the memories and read them for others, but I can no longer do so because of my son. My son turned his back on the light. When he perished I could not stand the thought that his spirit might not be welcomed into Auchindoun. I interfered and trapped him here. Now he twists and tortures the memories until they cannot be read. You must do what I cannot bear to do myself. Use this elixir to enter the spirit realm......and destroy my son's spirit. 
	Blessing of the Wolf	 
Defeat Gardul Venomshiv in Shattered Rise.	Gardul Venomshiv	We need tae take out Gardul and take his poison recipe while we still have the element o' surprise on our side. We need the recipe tae figure out the antidote. This may be our only opportunity. If what ye learned is true, his camp is just south of here. Ye take him down, and I'll make sure none of his guards interfere. 
Kill 18 Bloodmane Saberon.	The Initiate's Revenge	I... I'm finished. My spirit will be with the Raven Mother soon. I beg of you, stranger... avenge me! Slay these filthy beasts. 
Take the proof to Limbflayer at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Botani Bloom	This bloom is proof of your strength at slaying botani and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the bloom back to Limbflayer and claim your accolades! 
Find Cutter at Bastion Rise.	Thieving Dwarves	Cutter is on the trail of the artifact the dwarves stole. He has the nose of a wolf when it comes to hunting in the jungle. Follow the canyons south until you find him. It would seem the wolf queen and I are going to do more damage here before we leave. We will follow as quickly as we can. 
Examine the Siege Munitions and Heavy Plating in The Boneslag.	Of Fire and Thunder	The Iron Wolf... brought weapons...<cough>...weapons of fire and thunder. Our warriors have never seen such weapons. We were not ready.<wheeze> We must learn... to overcome... 
Use Illusion Effigies to create decoys for 10 Enslaved Outcasts.	Hardly Working	Those who were not incinerated at Veil Akraz are forced to help the Adherents excavate the very weapons aimed at their heads. Anyone trying to escape is vaporized by the overseer's Apexis turret. With these effigies, they won't know anyone has left! Place one near an enslaved worker and observe as it creates a perfect copy. It even cloaks the subject in shadow, so they can slip away safely! 
Collect a Chunk of Lunar Rock.	Shadowmoonwell	The archmage has asked me to prepare this moonwell. Once it is completed, I'll be able to sanctify its water for use against the demon. Only one thing remains. A piece of one of Draenor's moons has fallen into a nearby pool on the far side of the woods. Such a thing is perfect for use in the dedication of the moonwell to Elune. Will you bring it back for me, George? 
Kill 10 fel-cursed creatures in the Cursed Woods.	A Curse Upon the Woods	Cordana tells me that the creatures of the woods are cursed by the same fel energies keeping Khadgar from scrying into the orc village. This will not do. If we were on Azeroth, I could find a cure in a reasonable timeframe. However, we are not, nor do we have the luxury of time. Better to put a swift end to their suffering rather than allow these poor creatures to linger with demonic energy. 
Recover 10 Ironcoat Cannonballs and 1 Armory Cannon.	Prime the Cannons	The armory is lost to the traitors. All we have left are these few cannons with no ammunition. Soldier, I need you to recover cannonballs so we can get these things running. Actually, one more cannon wouldn't hurt, either. 
Kill 7 Fungal Lurchers.	Vengeance for the Fallen	I... almost made it out. Most of us... dead. The others... they are no longer themselves. These lurching spore beasts are the cause, dragging us further into the marsh... stop them. 
Look through Gazlowe's Eye 'n' Ear.	An Eye for a Spy	Excellent, excellent! I'll make sense of these manual pages and will get the Iron Shredder operational immediately! While I do that, take a look through my Eye 'n' Ear. That's where you'll be headed soon! 
Kill Ra'tok the Hammer in the Orunai Coast.	WANTED: Ra'tok the Hammer	The Iron Horde have no honor. They disgust me. We spotted one of their lieutenants wandering the cliffs not far from our base. I believe that she is tracking our movements to prepare for some sort of assault from the Orunai Coast. I understand you have much to do, commander. If you have the time, I believe it would be beneficial to our position's integrity. 
	The Burial Fields	 
	Flight Home	 
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Snarler-In-Training.	Wolf Training: The Garn	The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land. The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them. There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your wolf, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your wolf will truly be ready. 
Collect 10 Unrefined Power Crystals.	Crystals of Unusual Power	Arcane crystals of this size and power are quite rare even on Draenor. It is no coincidence that the Draenei built Shattrath and Auchindoun so close to this mine. I am interested in learning more about these particular crystals and their arcane nature. Return to me with any unrefined power crystals that you may find and I will make sure that you are adequately compensated for your effort. 
Kill 500 Pandaren Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.	Nemesis: Terror of the Tushui	<Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death. Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all pandaren that stand defiantly against the Horde. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Alliance: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of pandaren. Conquer our enemy and be known as terror of the Tushui. Fail and be nothing. 
Defeat Rakkiri while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.	Clefthoof Training: Rakkiri	Your clefthoof is most at home here in Frostfire Ridge, and that is where we will begin the training. Out on the icy plains, you will find a hunter of blood and death. The winged terror Rakkiri is feared by beasts across this region, and will prove a good first test for your future mount. 
Bring Tyra Silverblood 10 Ghost Truffles.	Phantom Potion	Every turn you take in Ashran you run into danger. But don't fret George, I've developed the perfect solution. It's my very own riff on the popular Invisibility Potion. I'm just missing one of the ingredients: cave mushrooms. Luckily, a variety grows right here in Ashran. 
	Orunai Coast	 
	LFGDungeons - Draenor - Raid Finder - Nth	 
Speak with Shadow Hunter Kajassa at Telaar.	Target of Opportunity: Telaar	We've received reports that the draenei enclave at Telaar has fallen to the Warsong. I sent a small group of shadow hunters to check on the situation. Kajassa is their leader. Will you meet her there? 
Use the Eye of Anzu at 4 Wind Serpent Nests.	Gaze of the Raven God	The Sethekk are breeding vile wind serpents from Sethe's blood and bones. With these creatures, they will tear apart the sky. The nests are protected by powerful magic, but Anzu's gaze should penetrate them with ease. Let us visit the nests and destroy them! 
Collect 12 Pairs of Leatherhide Ears from Leatherhide clefthoof.	That Pounding Sound	Commander. The rangari and I were just discussing the merits of various 'hunting' approaches. I assured her that the SI:7 are well-equipped to deal with any situation, even ones out in the wild. She seems to think that we don't know what we're doing when it comes to bringing down game in 'her land.'We're not going to let her get away with saying that, right? Let's take down some clefthoof. 
Collect 5 Glowing Mushrooms.	The Secret of the Fungus	I'm beginning to sense a strong... connection... between the fungus and the creatures that inhabit it. There are certain mushrooms that are stronger than others. I believe if I had some samples of these I could use them, track the source of this foul fungus and... deal with it. 
Take the trophy to Maraad at Highpass in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian	Defeating the Fungal Praetorian has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim. Take this to Maraad at Highpass. 
Take the trophy to Durotan at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Roardan the Sky Terror	Defeating Roardan has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim. Take this to Durotan at Beastwatch. 
Speak with the Shade of Terokk in Veil Terokk.	Call of the Talon King	$p, you have done much for my people. I wish to thank you on their behalf. Please visit Veil Terokk when you can. 
Take the Curious Growth to Rangari Sheera at the Rangari Enclave in Shadowmoon Valley.	Fungal Bundle	The umbraspore giant you killed seemed immune to the volatile spores in the area. Perhaps the odd growths you found all over its body contribute to its immunity. You grab a big, disgusting fungal lump in order to give it to the rangari for study. 
	Get the Xuk Outta Here!	 
Speak with Gar'rok.	An Old Friend	Since the beginning, a shaman has been called to serve the Throne of Elements as its keeper. It is a lifelong calling and a new keeper is only called after the last has passed on. Gar'rok has been our loyal keeper for many years, cleansing the Elemental Plateau during countless cycles of rebirth. Our keeper is dying, and soon another will be called in his place. When he passes, he should not be alone. Go to him, George. Ease his pain. 
Retrieve the Scuffed Bangle from Talon King Ikiss.	The False Talon King	Ikiss was once a respected sage among the Adherents, but his search for the truth of Terokk's fall led to his own banishment. Ikiss became obsessed with Terokk, even claiming to be the old hero reborn. He commands the Sethekk, promising untold power in a new age of darkness. Know this: Ikiss is no Talon King. Slay the delusional fool, and search him for anything useful. He is known to collect powerful trinkets. 
Gather 5 Solar Cores from Apexis Guardians.	Legacy of the Apexis	The Apexis are long gone, but their legacy lies preserved in ancient chambers beneath Arak. Legions of dormant constructs; crystals flush with solar energy; magical techniques lost to the ages - the Apexis left behind caches of immense power, which the Adherents of Rukhmar have begun to unearth. Bring me the cores of the re-activated constructs patrolling the excavation site. Those crystals are the basis of Apexis technology, and the key to our enemy's devastating power. 
Watch Birchus's ritual.	Laying Dionor to Rest	You have given me a tremendous gift with this bloom. I can finally send Dionor back to the Overgrowth for good and end this nightmare. All that remains is the ritual... stay and behold something you will never see again in your lifetime... 
Speak to Vindicator Icia at Fort Wrynn.	Come Together	Gul'dan and his cronies would do well to remember this day. We Auchenai are not to be trifled with. You should inform Vindicator Icia in your outpost of our success. She can reach out to the scattered refugees and their families. 
Gather 5 Crate of Surplus Materials.	Lost in Transition	<Sir/Ma'am>, the storehouse is fully operational and I've seen to it that your supplies are safely stored away and accounted for. Unfortunately, during the rest of my audit I found that we are missing a few crates of surplus material - probably misplaced by one of the porters. If you happen to come across any of the surplus crates while making your rounds, please bring them to me and I'll update our ledger. 
Collect blood from demons in Socrethar's Rise.	Dark Grimoire: The Final Ingredient	The final ingredient to create Megacharge's bomb is a sizable quantity of demon's blood. Unfortunately, that's not something they're likely to give up easily... 
	Lumber, I Hardly Knew 'Er	 
	Sealing Fate: Heap of Apexis Crystals	 
Collect 20 Shadow Council Missives from Shadow Council representatives in the Ruins of Kra'nak or the Throne of Kil'jaeden.	Secrets of the Shadow Council	Gul'dan has been building a spy network for himself - the so-called ""Shadow Council"". As they struggle to control Tanaan, the Shadow Council has grown careless. Their members are out in the open, recruiting arakkoa at the Ruins of Kra'nak or summoning demons at the Throne of Kil'jaeden. Find members of the Shadow Council and acquire any intelligence they were foolish enough not to destroy! 
Kill 15 Burning Blade forces at Hallvalor.	The Friend of My Enemy	Hallvalor is the ancestral home of the Burning Blade clan. Since they're such fast friends, the Warsong have allowed the blademasters to remain in Nagrand. We are fierce, but we won't win if the Burning Blade attack us. It would be wise to strike first. 
Recover 8 Ravenspeaker Scroll Fragments.	Words of the Raven Mother	We came here to perform the ritual of calling to bring the return of the Raven Mother. We had distributed parts of the scroll to everyone and had just begun when we were attacked by the Bloodmane. Now most of the flock has been killed and fragments lay scattered across our homeland. The ritual was a failure but we will not allow these mongrels to break our faith. We must continue our prayers here but we would be grateful if you can recover the scroll fragments for us. 
Kill 15 Burning Blade forces at Hallvalor.	Blood of the Burning Blade	Hallvalor is the ancestral home of my clan, the Burning Blade. When the new warlord and his family came to power, I was exiled for being a half-breed. I want justice. I suspect you won't mind killing along the way. Not that you'll have any choice. 
Destroy 10 Void Terrors and 15 Void Tendrils.	The Void March	Hidden behind the veil of the Twisting Nether, the abominations of the void march upon Oshu'gun. The great void growing deep within the mountain has drawn them like moths to a flame. Wave upon wave, the creatures of the void march upon the mountain and sacrifice themselves to Invalidus. The void lord Invalidus cannot be allowed to feast upon the other void creatures, else it will become too powerful to stop. 
Retrieve the Apexis Interface from Overseer Akrath.	Shot-Caller	<Solar energy courses through the slumbering constructs, their ancient servos whirring to life all around you. It is too late to shut them down now. Outside, an arakkoa overseer bellows commands, each answered by the buzz of an Apexis beam carving away at the mountain. That turret would make short work of the constructs - if you can command it.> 
Speak with the spirits at the Ancestral Grounds.	Spiritual Matters	The spirits of the dead have long been drawn to the mountain of Oshu'gun. As long as I can remember, the woods have been filled with ancestral spirits making a ghostly pilgrimage to the heart of the mountain. I fear that the souls drawn to Oshu'gun are being consumed by the growing void within the mountain. Make your way to the Ancestral Grounds and commune with the spirits there for guidance. 
Use Restorative Goldcaps to revive fallen rangari.	An Act of Kindness	I know that you and Vindicator Yrel are here on important matters, but I must ask you a favor. A squad of rangari left on patrol just before the poisonous mist set in. If they were caught out in the swamp, they are surely in trouble. Harvest the Restorative Goldcaps growing among the reeds, and use them to restore any fallen rangari that you find. If you find yourself in trouble, eat one to combat the poison. 
Collect 30 Fresh Charcoal from ancients.	All Natural	Oh, you have a trading post? Fantastic! Let's make a deal. You help me power up my laser cannon, and I'll trade some of this... thermo... ultra... obsidiglass with you for some weapons. The ancients all around here are practically made of charcoal after the arakkoa weapon hit, you should go get some of that! 
Use the Effigy of Terokk to re-live Terokk's fall. Find Lithic, rally 5 Outcast Talon Guards, slay 20 Crazed Outcasts, and use the Eye of Anzu.	Terokk's Fall	<Once again, Reshad's voice envelops you.>Terokk was a powerful and respected king, beloved by his people. His sages, however, were not so loyal. Hungry for control of Skyreach, they conspired against him. 
Take the trophy to Durotan at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Trophy of Glory: Erosian	Defeating Erosian has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim. Take this to Durotan at Beastwatch. 
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.	Talbuk Training: The Garn	I've got one last challenge for ye, commander, but if it isn't a doozy. They call them the garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear a man apart in seconds. Any beast in their right mind would be scared witless at the sight of such a predator. There's a lone garn that's made it from their usual home in Frostfire, all the way over to Nagrand. Take your talbuk, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your talbuk will truly be ready for war. 
Take the proof to Limbflayer at Beastwatch in Gorgrond.	Proof of Strength: Goren Tooth	This tooth is proof of your strength at slaying goren and your gladiator friend has born witness! Take the tooth back to Limbflayer and claim your accolades! 
Speak to Prelate Reenu at The Draakorium.	The Southern Wilds	I've heard disturbing news from our friends at The Draakorium, to the south. The town lies near a swamp, and recently, dangerous creatures have been venturing near its borders. You seem like a seasoned adventurer. If you are heading that way, would you mind checking in with our people there? I would feel much better if I knew they were safe. 
Break the boulder barrier using Beatface the gladiator.	Beatface vs. Boulder	The saberon took their treasure up the rise and barricaded themselves in after Birchus attacked. It will be difficult to get in but I hear you have resources to handle this. One of their entrances is covered with a large boulder. Too large for you or I, but perhaps an ogre with a large enough hammer could break it. I think you know who I am talking about... 
Collect 15 Iron Horde Naval Manifests from forces in Ironhold Harbor.	A Little Wetwork	The shattered remnants of the Iron Horde pour into Tanaan through Ironhold Harbor. If we knew more about their fleet we could dispatch countermeasures from your shipyard in Shadowmoon. Perhaps you could gather some naval intelligence for our cause? 
	Penny For Your Thoughts	 
Speak with Delvar Ironfist.	A Surly Dwarf	Before you go there is someone you might want to talk with. He's opinionated, a bit gruff, and very overbearing, but he's the best damn warrior I've met in ages. He belongs on the front lines with you, commander. And trust me, he knows it. 
Bring the Scuffed Bangle to Lithic's Rest.	Lithic's Gift	<Kurekk squints at the bangle, rotating it slowly in his claws.>There is an inscription on the inside.""To my father, may Rukhmar illuminate your path. With love, Lithic.""It cannot be... This is Terokk's bangle! It was a gift from his daughter, he wore it for years until...Well, we had better return it. Terokk built a memorial to Lithic not far from Talon Watch. It should rest there. 
Burn 6 Bodies.	We Burn the Dead	I saw lots of bodies here. Kaz always said to burn the bodies. That way they can't come back as the mean greens. We should burn the bodies. 
	Mulverick's Offer of Service	 
Defeat Bulbapore while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.	Talbuk Training: Bulbapore	Way down south in the Spires of Arak, the land's being overtaken by the mushrooms that grow underwater. The result? Strange fungal creatures sprouting up all over the place. Taking on a strange creature, like the fungal giant Bulbapore, gives us a great chance to expose your talbuk to predators it's unfamiliar with. 
	Trading Post	 
Harvest a Timber Sample from Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.	Sharper Blades, Bigger Timber	Incredible news, Commander George. Your ever-loyal servant has managed to secure us commandojacks. Now maybe you don't know what a commandojack is, so let me explain: they're like lumberjacks, only highly trained in the art of killing. Mostly they're out of work mercenaries and assassins. What this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these commandojacks a test run. There's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck! 
Speak to Ageilaa at the Jorune Mine in Talador.	Every Bit Counts	The Jorune Mine, west of here, needs your help! My good friend Ageilaa sent me to look for help. Exarch Maladaar sent over what vindicators he could spare, but it isn't enough! Will you go to the mine and help us? We need the crystals from the mine to create more defenses like the crystals you see on the Burning Front. 
Retrieve 5 Footman Longswords and 5 Thunderbrew Kegs.	Why Is The Brew Gone?	Commander, we have a bit of a... uh... problem. This group o' saberon followed us from Gorgrond, and they've been stealin' our footmen's swords an' slaughtering our peasants! I hate to ask fer your time, but all of yer men are guardin' the camp from any further raids. Plus...<Quartermaster O'Riley lowers her voice to a whisper.>They took our beer! 
Destroy the 3 Iron Horde War Machines.	Silence the War Machines	The Iron Horde supplied Lok-rath with war machines from Ironfist Harbor. It won't take long for them to level Yrel's Watch. Someone has to silence those war machines! 
Burn 6 Mulching Bodies.	Burn the Bodies	You don't understand. Anythin' these plant people don't infest they fatten up and then turn inta mulch. I say we take out their food source. These botani got a few corpses lying around that I saw. Might be a good idea to burn those bodies. Let's find out if they can infest ash. 
Kill 10 Iron Thunderguards within the Bones of Agurak in Frostfire Ridge.	Savage Vengeance	The Thunderlord are a blight George.<Ruk'gan spits in disgust.>My daughter, Grishna, was killed by those monsters. Only their blood will bring me peace now. If you would help me then I need you to cause a distraction so I can sneak to a position closer to their camp. Killing a few of their so called ""Iron Thunderguard"" would be perfect. 
Gather 5 Coils of Sturdy Rope from Thunderlord Wranglers in the Bones of Agurak.	A Collection of Coils	This coil of rope has been woven thick, the better for the Thunderlord Wranglers to handle the dangerous beasts they tame. Scout Ruk'gan might have a use for this and a few more like it. 
Use the Deadly Iron Trap to capture a Ironhide Bull, Direfang Alpha, or Wetland Trampler.	Bigger Trap, Better Rewards	Ah, commander, it is good to see you again. With the materials we have gathered here in Draenor, we have been able to construct a trap strong enough to immobilize even the mightiest beast. These enormous creatures can be found on the western side of Nagrand, among the most fertile plains. A word of warning: these beasts are great and powerful. You may want to bring some friends along. 
Collect Maa'run's Hoof.	WANTED: Maa'run's Hoof	Posted by: OrrinA wild talbuk called ""Maa'run"" wanders the hills southeast of Embaari Village and west of The Draakorium. My brother was injured by this foul beast, and now lays in recovery. For the safety of all the nearby villages, we must put an end to this vicious, rampaging creature! A handsome reward will be given to anyone who can bring me his hoof as proof of his demise. 
Kill 8 Frostfire Gronnlings.	A Gronnling Problem	It's gonna be quite a task to build you a fortress if there's gronnlings rampaging around. I don't think anyone else here can handle taking those big beasts out, so you might need to take care of it yourself. 
	Aruuna's Desolation	 
Assault the Sargerei forces at the Temple of Sha'naar in Tanaan Jungle.	Assault on the Temple of Sha'naar	Up in the hills of Tanaan Jungle, the Sargerei have converted a once-sacred temple into a den of demonic summoning. We must attack them now, before their rituals complete. The longer we delay, the stronger our enemy grows. 
	Encounter Mushroom	 
	Sealing Fate: Mountain of Apexis Crystals	 
Collect Skothwa's Eye.	Eye Candy	You! Get in the fight or get out of our way. This is no ordinary goren attack. Look over there, a gronnling is sacking our grubhall. That hunchbacked gorebucket bit a chunk out of my lovely Marrow! Rip the eye out of its forehead and bring it to me. That should buy me enough time to get her clear of this goren hole. 
Use the goren disguise to explore locations in Gorgrond.	Xuk It!	It is done. With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the goren freely, but you can move as they do. Your travels through Gorgrond are now made simple. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach. Xuk's ancestors have made it so. 
Retrieve the Heart of the Fury.	The Fate of Gordawg	Looming monstrously between us and the inner chamber is the great fury we have sought to return to the Throne of Elements. Gordawg stands before us enthralled; a slave to Cho'gall. My heart is heavy with grief to see such a great creature mindless and enslaved by evil. There is no going back, in order to push forward you must go through Gordawg. It pains me, but Gordawg must be slain. Slay Gordawg and return the fury's heart to the Throne of Elements where it belongs. 
Kill Ontogen the Harvester.	Chapter II: The Harvest	I have seen a creature working with the ancient saplings, imbuing them with anger and hatred toward creatures unlike them. Perhaps it is this botani who is responsible for the unusually aggressive nature of ancients here in Tangleheart. Would killing this botani do us good? I fear I would be no match for it alone.- Frenna 
Use the Wolf Lasso on a Young Snarler and follow it until it is tamed.	Wrangling a Wolf	This next one will test you to your very limits, commander. The wolf is the most savage beast in all of Draenor. The wolves of Nagrand, mounts of the fabled Warsong clan, can rend a man to bits in seconds. They're also faster and more agile than anything you've seen yet. Here's your lasso. Good luck, and don't get yourself killed! 
Defeat the Gorian Beast-Lasher while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.	Clefthoof Training: Cruel Ogres	Nagrand is home to the mightiest beasts in Draenor, and the ogres of the region have learned to tame them using brutal techniques. There is one ogre in particular, the Gorian Beast-Lasher, that smells of blood and fear. Go on and see how your clefthoof reacts to that. 
Kick 10 Ravager Eggs in Camp Thornscar.	Egg Punt	<A sweaty, pulsing egg - no doubt flush with ravager larvae. A swift kick should take care of these.> 
	Vignette: Lo'marg Jawcrusher	 
	Treasure: Ogre Booty 008	 
Speak to Penny Clobberbottom at Beastwatch.	Penny From Heaven	<Durotan looks at you curiously.>Those from your world are not much for subtlety, are they? Go on ahead and greet our new companion. We will join you as soon as we can make ready. 
	Garrison Max-level Choice Tracker: Gorgrond Primal Forest	 
Slay Vicegnaw just outside Vol'jin's Pride.	Send Them Running	Your scouts have located the saberon's alpha male just outside our gates! Commander, I believe that dispatching this target will send any of these remaining vermin running back to their caves. I do not wish to ask more of you, but you are the only one capable of this task, <sir/ma'am>. 
	Forsaken Brains	 
Use the Small Sack of Salavaged Goods near the incinerator at your Salvage Yard.	Salvaging the Situation	Here at the Salvage Yard we inspect any extra material your followers bring back from the field, preserving anything that may be useful. I have an extra pack of material our people brought in that I've yet to go through. Why don't you take it over to the incinerator and see if it contains anything useful? 
Defeat Captain Boomspark in the Ring of Trials.	Ring of Trials: Captain Boomspark	You've been making a name for yourself in the arena, George! Don't get too excited though...fame has its consequences! You've been challenged by an up-and-coming gladiator who is looking to make a name for himself, sound familiar? Your next fight is against Captain Boomspark, a mercenary who came here to fight for the Iron Horde. The Iron Horde ain't exactly throwing piles of gold around, so now he's here! He's got a shredder, so watch out for the blades... and the fire too... especially the fire! 
	Upper Blackrock Spire Challenge Mode - Consolation (Nth)	 
Speak with Karg Bloodfury in Stonefang Outpost.	They Who Held Fast	The siege has been broken - they underestimated the resilience of Stonefang, and our reinforcement wave from Bladespire caught them completely off-guard. Once we finish cleaning up here, we rally anyone who can still fight and prepare to march for Grom'gar. The outpost captain, Karg Bloodfury, should have come out to meet us by now. Can you get him out here? Tell him Lokra is waiting. He knows how much I hate to be kept waiting.

Go to Stonemaul Arena, bang challenge gong in center of arena, and face beasts of slavemaster. Maybe you make Ok'mok so mad he jump down himself to kill you. If he do, kill him instead.

Slay 8 Tormented Echoes.	Echoes of the Past	When a spirit is consumed by the void, an echo of the soul is all that is left behind. Neither in the physical or spiritual sense of the word would these echoes be considered 'alive.' The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed. If left unchecked, the echoes will lash out against the living and stir the spirits of the dead from their graves. In order to restore peace to the Ancestral Grounds, these echoes must be put to rest.

Defeat the Darkwing Roc while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.	Riverbeast Training: Darkwing Roc	The windrocs of Nagrand are a smart predator, often swooping down on unwary prey in packs. If your beast doesn't keep an eye on the sky, it's likely to lose both of em.'Head on out to Nagrand and take on the fiercest windroc of the bunch, the Darkwing Roc. That'll be a good test for the both of ye. 
Gather 6 Prowler Blood, 6 Snapdragon Fronds, and a Riverhopper Eye.	A Pilgrimage Gone Awry	I am a humble pilgrim, I swear. Please don't hurt me! My sister and I were traveling to Auchindoun to pay our respects to my grandmother when we hit an overturned rock and lost control of our caravan. I managed to survive, but my sister...<Nadur cries.>Please, you have to help me. I'm desperate. If you could bring me some prowler blood, snapdragon flowers, and a riverhopper eye, I can fashion a potion to bring her back. I just know it.... 
Find the pilot of the Dark Iron tank.	He Drew Aggro...culture	What you saw was the wake of the genesaur, Iyu. It was chasing this mechanical monstrosity and the person who drove it. I believe the pilot of this vessel is still alive and trapped within the ruins of the camp. If you wish them to be recovered, I recommend doing so now. 
Kill 500 Goblin Players in Player versus Player combat across Draenor.	Nemesis: Killer of Kezan	<Kuros hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.

Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Horde: they will leave Draenor or they will die. Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of goblin. Conquer our enemy and be known as the killer of Kezan. Fail and be nothing. 
	Sealing Fate: Garrison Resources	 
Follow the clue from the journal to find Lor Stonefist. Defeat her and claim the Rough Crystal Shard.	Dream of Argus: The First Fragment	In his quest to restore the Dream of Argus, Maatun enlisted the help of three orcs. These same orcs betrayed him and took the crystal shards before they could be combined. If you find these orcs, they may still have them. The first target shouldn't be far. The journal reads:""I was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities."" 
	Sealing Fate: Immense Fortune of Gold	 
Break the vine barrier using your shredder.	Shredder vs. Saberon	After the saberon stole from these plants, they were forced further up Steamscar Rise and barricaded themselves in. I could not find a way to get in but you have the solution. One path is blocked by a tangle of hard vines. I have heard you have a machine that could cut through that with ease. I would get on a shredder and take those vines down. 
	Guk	 
Kill Ralshiara.	Ralshiara's Demise	It was said in the Journal of the Rising Sun that eating in the mornings cannot be done without harming a few eggs. The Bloodmane matron, Ralshiara, feasts upon sacred raven eggs for her snacks. How dare she! She must die for her sins! Take the path south over the mountains to reach the accursed home of the Bloodmane. Take this trinket, it fell to us from the heavens as a sign of the Raven Mother's favor and with it you might have a chance. 
Slay Sun-Sage Kairyx.	Pyrophobia	W- we have done n-n-nothing to provoke the arakkoa... w-why would they attack Aruuna? What do they want from us? I want to run, but I'm... too afraid. That leader of theirs will burn me to a crisp, I just know it! H-he's just inside the inn... 
	Vignette: Fungal Praetorian

Kill Worgskin the Savage.	Consumed by Vengeance	They... they came out of nowhere. From that direction.<The young girl points vaguely west through her tears.>They were on their nasty wolves. Please, commander, my family's honor is at stake. Will you get vengeance for me? 
Kill Venombarb.	WANTED: Venombarb	Posted by: FalroghVenombarb taunts me every day. Screeching and killing me buzz. Somebody, anybody, kill the beast. I don't want proof, I want peace and quiet. 
Molthron within the Bloodmaul Territory wants you to bring him 6 Piles of Elemental Ash.	Ashes Of The Past	The ogres are a plague upon my kind. They summon my kin and force them into servitude, working them without rest till their heat fades away and they crumble into dust. Their ashes must return to the lava flows so that they can be reborn! The Ogres keep the dust in pouches on their person thinking it would enhance their strength. Go slay them and recover the ashes of my people! 
Mark 6 Trees.	Back to Work	Alright, boss. We're gonna need some lumber if we're gonna get this garrison started off right. If you mark some trees to be cut down, your peons will do the rest. 
	Vignette: Berthora	 
Defeat the Darkwing Roc while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.	Talbuk Training: Darkwing Roc	The windrocs of Nagrand are a smart predator, often swooping down on unwary prey in packs.

That'll be a good test for the both of ye. 
Accept the Blood Oath of Blademaster Na'Shra.	The Interest of Bruto	You have done me a great service. This blade is as much yours as it is mine. I offer you this blood oath: I shall serve your cause and lend my knowledge of blades and mining to your forces. Will you accept it? 
	Treasure: Frostwolf Cache 04	 
Speak with Baros Alexston at your garrison in Shadowmoon Valley.	Supply Drop	Your laborers below have finished with the harvest and are ready to cart supplies back to your garrison. Don't worry about the safety of your caravan this time; I will dispatch a rangari detail to shadow them from the woods and protect them. The Exarchs will always watch over you. Your supplies should be waiting for you when you return to your garrison. Good luck with your campaign, George!

Slay 25 Iron Horde orcs in Tanaan Jungle.	Bringing Down the Iron Horde	Ever since we humiliated 'em at Blackrock Foundry, the Iron Horde has been on the run. Gul'dan is converting them all into fel orcs, but I ain't scared. A bloodlusting orc is twice as strong but twice as stupid. Hey! Let's wade into the battlefields of Tanaan and lay waste to as many orcs as we can. Orc or fel orc - doesn't matter to me. 
Speak with Torgg Flexington at Warspear in Ashran.	Upgrades in Ashran	You got some construction guides or assembly notes on ya? Oh man that's good news! I know this guy in Ashran, goes by Torgg Flexington. He's got finished blueprints we need! Go talk to this guy and bring back some good stuff for us to build, ok? 
	Deathtalon	 
Use the Riverbeast Lasso on a Young Riverwallow and follow it until it is tamed.	Requisition a Riverbeast	I wasn't sure about this next beast, but it turns out that they've got a key strategic purpose. The riverbeast is quite at home in the water! You'll find the best ones around in Talador, around about Duskfall Island. Look for the huge, floating lumps out in the water. Try not to get wet! 
Absorb the combined power of the Nightshards and the Eye of Gul'dan using the Heart of Zin-Azshari at the Lunar Crucible.	Balance of Power	At long last, it is time to reap the fruits of your labors. Lothrius tells of a place deep in the former Moonguard Stronghold used to infuse new Guards with immense power. It will be the perfect place to tap into and augment the power of the Nightshards you gathered. Gather your effects and meet me there when you are ready, and we will use the Heart to finally reveal the great power within your artifact. 
Return to your class order hall and recruit a new champion.	Champions of Legionfall	The battle to reclaim the Broken Shore is straining our resources. We cannot afford to relent, lest the Legion undo all that we have accomplished. The members of your order have given much, but more is needed. Rally your champions and do what you must to bolster their ranks. There may be untapped power in this land that will turn the tide of war in our favor. 
Complete any 4 world quests on the Broken Shore.	Armies of Legionfall	Assist the Armies of Legionfall by completing 4 world quests. 
Complete the Assault on Broken Shore scenario.	Assault on Broken Shore	It has been a long and costly war, George. It is time we put an end to it. We will drive the Burning Legion from their seat of power and close their gateway into Azeroth. Our first step is to gain a foothold on the Broken Shore. Divided, the Alliance and Horde faced defeat. But united as the Armies of Legionfall, we will claim victory! 
Complete the ""Defending Azurewing Repose"" storyline in Azsuna, then meet Archmage Kalec at Azurewing Repose.	The Power Within	Do you have a moment, Conjurer? The power within your weapon has grown exponentially as you have fought the Legion, but I cannot help but wonder if there is something... more... hidden away within. Perhaps even a new form entirely! The very thought demands we find out for sure. The ancient blue dragon in Azsuna known as Senegos lays dying and is key to our journey. You must aid him - I will meet you in his domain as soon as I am able. 
Meet the stranger outside Shal'Aran.	Visitor in Shal'Aran	Someone came to Shal'Aran while you were in the City. She asked for you specifically. I did not recognize her face, nor her voice, but she seemed trustworthy and earnest. She is just outside the cavern. Meet with her and determine her purpose for coming here. 
Defeat a Legion Assault in the Broken Isles.	Defending Broken Isles	In our zeal to reclaim the Broken Shore from the Legion, we cannot allow the rest of this land to fall into the demons' foul grip. Kil'jaeden has dispatched his forces across the Broken Isles, threatening the homelands of the allies you have made. You must answer their call in this hour of need. Turn back these demon assaults with haste, Mechanict. The Armies of Legionfall will see that the Broken Shore remains secured. 
Collect 50 Marks of the Sentinax.	Mark of the Sentinax	The Sentinax rains down terror upon the Broken Shore, unleashing hordes of demons that menace our forces. The fiends seek to stop us from taking the Tomb. They will fail. Lure out the strongest among their vile ranks. Slay them and seize the marks they bear. Make the Legion fear our strength! 
Use the Pillars of Creation to seal the Tomb of Sargeras.	Pillars of Creation	Our campaign on the Broken Shore has reached a turning point. The Armies of Legionfall stand ready to breach the Tomb of Sargeras and seal the Legion's gateway to our world. The time to strike is now, George. The Aegis of Aggramar has been secured in the Cathedral. The echo of Magna Aegwynn said that the other Pillars of Creation are needed to seal the tomb. It is fitting that you have the honor of locking those ancient relics in place and closing down the Felstorm once and for all. 
Meet your escort to the Exodar at Bladefist Bay.	The Hand of Fate	Ever since the Legion invaded the Exodar, the draenei have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus. At long last they have a vessel that can take us there. With the way to that dreadful world open, we simply could not ask for a better opportunity to strike. Prophet Velen called for you quite specifically to join the assault force. You should make your way to Bladefist Bay right away. Arrangements have been made for a ship there to take you to Azuremyst. 
Discover a hidden Legion threat while on the Broken Shore.	The Broken Shore: Investigating the Legion	While we focus efforts on the Broken Shore, we must be careful to guard against other threats. We have been getting disturbing reports on the Legion starting or supporting indirect threats to Azeroth. While you are on the Broken Shore, please keep an eye out for strange objects or intelligence that could give us a clue as to what and where these threats are. I know it is not a lot to go on, we will do our best from here as well. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	One Day at a Time	Thank you for coming, outlander. It is good to see you again. I have a situation in the city that needs your attention, but first... Let us talk of hope.<Thalyssra gestures toward the arcan'dor.>The fruit of the arcan'dor can truly free my people from the Nightwell. However, it only grows so fast. It will take time to distribute this cure. I think it only right that you help me pass out the fruit as it is ready. Please take this, and give it to anyone. 
Take the Remnant of Nhal'athoth to Velen on the Vindicaar.	A Beacon in the Dark	That was... an intense experience.<Alleria rubs her forehead.>It is difficult to focus. I need you to return to Velen. Give him this.<She places something cold and dense in your palm.>I feel as though he should have it, though I am not sure why. Tell him all that we have learned. I am sure Romuul will have been watching our progress. With any luck, a beacon is already headed our way. 
Activate all of the leyline feeds in Suramar, then speak with Valtrois.	Giving It All We've Got	The arcan'dor is drawing incredible amounts of energy. Even with the leyline feed at full capacity, we may not have the power. Let us first ensure that all potential leyline conduits connecting to Shal'Aran are active. Then I can attempt to amplify the output and hopefully satisfy this insufferable plant. 
	Crushing the Legion	 
Successfully complete a Legionfall mission at your Class Order Hall.	Championing Our Cause	Important work has been done by your order, Mechanict. Your champions have succeeded time and again in undermining the Legion's invasion. As we make preparations for our assault on the Tomb of Sargeras, we need to keep the demons off balance. By pressuring them at every turn, we will expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited to our advantage. Send out your order's champions, George. Their missions are vital to the success of our campaign... especially as our confrontation with Kil'jaeden draws closer. 
Activate the correct three runes to help Rittsyn Flamescowl complete the spell to stabilize the portal.	Dabbling in the Demonic	Levia must have used these runes to aid her ritual. Even if she is as powerful as Modera says, she was a novice in demonic magic, so the runes must have helped stabilize the portal. I'll need you to find out what runes need to be activated to recreate her ritual. There are several books on runic magic in this room, which she no doubt studied for her ritual. Once you have activated the runes, I will complete the spell. 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar in Dalaran.	Khadgar's Discovery	Champion! Please come to the Violet Citadel immediately. I have made a discovery that I would like to share with you before the Council of Six. 
Return to the Vindicaar and secure the Sigil of Awakening.	The Sigil of Awakening	This relic is too powerful to keep it out in the open. We must return to the Vindicaar at once. The Prophet will know what to do. I did want to thank you, George. Without you this would not be possible. Quoram would have ensured I never got near the Sigil. Perhaps some day I will share that story with you. 
Complete any 4 Argussian Reach world quests on Argus.	Argussian Reach	Assist the Argussian Reach by completing 4 world quests. 
Use a Greater Portal Stone to summon Vizuul the Twisted at the Altar of End Times in Faronaar and collect his runebindings.	Twisted Power	It is time we put our work to the test by infusing the most potent source of power I know of - fel magic. Rarely, the Legion's minions will carry fragments of the greater portal stones used to usher in their eredar masters. If you gather enough to form a complete stone, you can use it in Faronaar to call forth the eredar lord Vizuul the Twisted at the Altar of End Times. The bindings Vizuul wears to augment his power should push the Heart to its very limit. 
Collect 30 Corrupted Essence from the Emerald Nightmare on Normal difficulty or higher.	The Emerald Nightmare: Essence of Power	Now that we have a better understanding on the Heart's capabilities, it is time we tap into its true potential. In the Emerald Nightmare you will find creatures that should not be; monsters that defy all that the Dream stands for. All that the green flight itself stands for. Each of these fiends carry within them corrupted essence, as Oakheart did, but far more potent. Gather all that you can, and we will turn their corruption against them. 
Speak with Arcanist Valtrois.	A Change of Seasons	It is time. The arcan'dor is preparing to mature. With a final burst of growth, this gift will be fully realized. We must make ready the leyline feed. 
	The Soultakers	 
Deliver the Lost Mail to Madam Goya in Dalaran Underbelly.	Lost Mail	TO: MADAM GOYA, DALARAN UNDERBELLYURGENT! TIME-SENSITIVE! DELIVER IMMEDIATELY! 
Use the Construction Table to donate Legionfall War Supplies to the construction of the Mage Tower, Nether Disruptor, or Command Center.	Begin Construction	We've got the supplies. Now someone needs to decide what to do with 'em. Hmm. Looks like it's your call, being the Mechanict and all! Time to pick a building to focus on. 
	Withered Army Training	 
Locate Arluelle and give her a piece of the Arcan'dor Fruit.	Arluin's Request	I never thought I would need to read this...<Vanthir hefts a scroll in his hand.>Arluin made... plans... in the event he fell. It is not much, but I would like to honor his last request.<Vanthir hands you the scroll.>Go to the location marked on this map. Take this Arcan'dor Fruit and give it to a woman named Arluelle. Arluin was very specific that all rewards for his work be directed to her. I think he may have known what his sacrifice meant. I was wrong about him. 
Slay Gelmogg.	Crystal Fury	A drogbar stonecaster known as Gelmogg entered our sacred water caverns and aims to draw its power into himself. We must destroy him before he gets too powerful. He is in the upper caverns. 
Complete 10 world quests in Suramar.	Stabilizing Suramar	Elisande's plan has backfired. She thought to stamp out our rebellion by making an example of the Waning Crescent. Instead, she ignited the flame of the shal'dorei better than I ever could. We must maintain a cohesive campaign against Elisande and the Legion by fighting them in every corner of Suramar. Show the people that there is still hope - that there are still heroes willing to fight for them! 
Speak to Oculeth and meet Thalyssra in the Nighthold.	Fate of the Nightborne	Shortly after your victorious return from the Nighthold, urgent business took Thalyssra back to the palace. She has requested that you meet her there. Speak to me when you are prepared to join her. 
Defeat the Arm of the Magistrix.	Break An Arm	The insurgents you marshaled gave me some bad news, George. The arcanists loyal to Elisande have reactivated the Arm of the Magistrix. The most powerful construct ever attempted, it raged out of control and decimated an entire district before it was disabled. Truly they must be desperate to turn it against us. The scouts have spotted it in the Crimson Thicket to the north. We cannot allow it to reach full power if we are to succeed. 
Slay 100 demons on the Broken Shore.	Strike Them Down	The Felstorm continues to rain demon scum upon these shores. Kil'jaeden believes his army infinite, his resources inexhaustible. We will show him how wrong he is. Cut a swath of retribution through their ranks, Mechanict. Strike down demon after demon, until your weapons are bathed in their blood. And when they cry out for mercy, send them screaming back into the Nether. 
Complete any 4 world quests in Val'sharah.	The Dreamweavers	Assist the Druids of Val'sharah by completing 4 world quests. 
Collect 50 Pristine Argunite from Invasion Points, Rare encounters, or treasure chests on Argus.	Fuel of a Doomed World	There is a rare and precious resource to be found in these wastes, George. Argunite was once abundant on Argus. Its magical properties helped eredar civilization thrive. Far better for us to make use of its power than the Legion. Seek out all the pristine argunite you can, champion. Every bit you recover will aid our cause. 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Darkfall Ridge Supplies"".	Remnants of Darkfall Ridge	My riders have talbuk, but my people need supplies. Food. Tools. Weapons. For millennia, we have migrated from one hovel to the next, moving each time the Legion discovered us. Never able to flee with our possessions, we left them behind. You are powerful, your followers are capable, but you do not know Argus. The landscape will dispatch you as mercilessly as the Legion. Recover our supplies from Darkfall Ridge, and I will order my people to guide your forces through the Argus Wastes. 
Slay Grimwing the Devourer.	Grimwing the Devourer	You have my thanks for rescuing me from captivity, George. However, Azoran is no mere demon. He is a powerful eredar who commands great rank within the Burning Legion. Before we can get to him, there is another that must be destroyed. Grimwing the Devourer is the strongest of the felbats. Place the basilisk flesh upon the altar to the north and slay Grimwing when she appears. Then, return to me with her head. My thirst for vengeance must be quenched. 
Interrupt the fox hunt.	Volpin the Elusive	According to the map, the fox hunt will start at the Feathermane Hunting Grounds in Suramar. If the Nightborne succeed, they will kill Volpin, a fox that is the last of his kind in the Broken Isles. Travel to the Hunting Grounds, and interrupt the hunt. 
Find a Reflection of the Council of Tirisfal in Dalaran City. Speak with one to receive his or her wisdom.	Memories of Ebonchill	Is that Ebonchill you've got there? Alodi's old staff? My my my... <Cough>In the days of the first guardian, all the members of the Council of Tirisfal granted their powers to the young mage in the hopes that he could overcome the Legion. <Wheeze> None of them are alive today... but that staff of yours remembers. Search the streets of Dalaran below for reflections of the former council members. Their memories may empower you as they once did Alodi. Seek them out and speak with one! 
Collect 20 Nightshards from the Nighthold on Normal difficulty or higher.	The Nighthold: Into the Nighthold	Our work is very nearly complete. Now that the Heart can safely absorb power from fel magic, we need the strongest sources of it that we can get our hands on. Gul'dan has called the nightborne's elite back to the Nighthold to aid him. The storm of fel energy above the palace has seeped into the very fabric of their being, even making its way into the crystallized pieces of the Nightwell that many carry with them. Those shards are exactly what we need, George. Save as many as you can in your assault. 
Investigate the city of Dalaran with Breanni's special spy catching cat, Fiona.	Pets Detective	I'm so glad you're here, George! I've been expecting a delivery of pet supplies and some new pets. But my distribution manager, Zantini has not reported in. I suspect foul play. There's been some shady people eyeballing my store for a while now. But I haven't been able to leave the store and track them down. You can. Take my pet cat, Fiona, and find these well hidden spies. 
Speak with Oculeth to start the assault.	Breaching the Sanctum	It is time. Valtrois is ready to destroy the barrier guarding the breach in the Sanctum. I will teleport you to the breach, then it falls on you to secure the area. Take these telemancy orbs. If you find you need support, use them to summon Withered. We must strike before the enemy can ready new defenses. Let me know when you are ready and we will begin. 
Meet Valewalker Farodin at the Temple of Fala'dora. You can travel there using the Portal to Falanaar in Shal'aran.	A Growing Crisis	The Arcan'dor is failing. This energy was once bound in its boughs and fueled its growth. There was balance, between life and arcane. Now that energy is breaking free. When the heart can no longer hold it, this tree will kill every living thing in this hall. I have seen this happen before and I must find a way to stop it from happening again. We must go to the tree that came before. Its bones can guide us. Meet me at the temple of Fal'adora. We will descend together. 
Complete any 4 world quests in Suramar.	The Nightfallen	Assist the Nightfallen of Suramar by completing 4 world quests. 
Collect 2500 Nethershards on the Broken Shore.	Shard Times	As you have surely noticed, a slain demon leaves behind Nethershards, solidified residual energy from the Twisting Nether. I require a significant quantity of them for an experiment I'm conducting... $1oa shards, to be precise. Why are you looking at me like that? We've had this conversation before. I did the math. I need exactly $1oa shards. Fewer would be inadequate. More would be absurd. Don't question my methods. Go! 
Find 3 Hidden Wyrmtongue Caches on the Broken Shore.	Relieved of Their Valuables	Not all demons on this shore stomp around in the open. Some slink about in the shadows, finding more subtle ways to advance the Legion's cause. I have been observing the behavior of smaller demons, these wyrmtongues. They seem to spend considerable time acquiring objects of power. We cannot allow them to use these items against us. The wyrmtongues stash their goods in chests spread around the Broken Shore. I suggest you relieve them of their ill-gotten gain. 
Complete 4 Army of the Light world quests on Argus.	Army of the Light	Assist the Army of the Light by completing 4 world quests. 
Enter an Invasion Point and defeat a Legion Commander.	Where They Least Expect It	The Legion's fanatical crusade leaves them spread thin. As they focus their defenses on Argus, we are free to tear into their forces on other worlds. Travel through an Invasion Point on Argus and show the Legion that there is no hiding from death. 
Retrieve the Heart of Zin-Azshari and defeat the Wrath of Azshara in the Eye of Azshara on Mythic difficulty.	Eye of Azshara: The Heart of Zin-Azshari	The naga in the Eye of Azshara summon terrible storms that ravage the coastline of Azsuna - storms far beyond the abilities of even their best sirens. It can only be the Heart of Zin-Azshari. Prior to the Sundering, Azshara's chosen used the Heart to greatly magnify their power - it is said to have been key in their dominance of the Well of Eternity. If you can journey to their domain and retrieve it, George, we will put its power to far better use than those foul creatures. 
Pick the Fruit of the Arcan'dor and share it with Chief Telemancer Oculeth, Arcanist Valtrois, and First Arcanist Thalyssra.	Arcan'dor, Gift of the Ancient Magi	Thousands of years ago, as the Quel'dorei were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of the arcane, a small enclave of druids met with the first of the elven magi. In the pale moonlight, they formed an order that would seek to bring the arcane into balance - using nature itself as a vessel. Thus the arcan'dor were created. My masters who belonged to this order have long since faded away. Yet their legacy remains. Their gift will mend the spirit of the shal'dorei. Let them eat, and be made whole. 
Stop all eight attacks on Chromie in one attempt in the Deaths of Chromie scenario.	The Deaths of Chromie	It looks like we're going to have to stop all eight attacks on me. In one fifteen-minute span. Even to me, that doesn't seem like a lot of time. Still, if anybody can do it, it's us. Are you ready, George? 
Collect a Fragment of Acuity, Wit, and Guile and combine them into a Mark of Cunning.	Gatekeeper's Challenge: Cunning	Archimonde expected greatness from his pupils. Only the most imaginative minds, the most adroit of intellects, could ever truly fathom the deepest reaches of our magic. I doubt you can relate. The path to the left will take you to a set of three statues. Use them to collect a Mark of Cunning. To preserve the integrity of this trial, I will not be able to provide hints. If you do, by some miracle, happen to succeed, I will formally recognize your... brilliance. 
Place a Dusk Lily Sigil above Vanthir's Cage.	Sign of the Dusk Lily	Simply... astounding. I have not felt this clear of mind in so long. I am still weak... I need to rest. But first...<Vanthir gestures to the top of his cage with a trembling hand.>Show them that the Dusk Lily triumphs this day. 
Slay Rare Elite Demon Commanders on the Broken Shore.	Take Out the Head...	The Broken Shore swims with Legion filth, each demon deserving of a swift and merciless end. But some are more insidious than the rest. Powerful combatants rallying others to their perfidious cause. Strike down these demon champions and you will fill the hearts of their kin with fear and doubt. Break the Legion's spirit and we will break its back. 
Slay Rozzeleth in Meredil.	Trial by Demonfire	We are out of time. I have reports that a pitlord has come to Meredil. I have dispatched a strike force. We cannot let this demon flank our army here, nor can we let him find Shal'Aran. It is time to temper these recruits in a real battle. Join our forces in Meredil, engage the demon, and help us ensure this new army of ours is not lost in its first conflict. 
Activate the Fal'adora Beacon in Temple of Fal'adora.	The Valewalker's Burden	The seed is awakening. Without power it will quickly wither and die. We must carry the seed out of here and plant it somewhere safe. I am not strong enough to bear this burden. But you... you are brimming with power. I can sense it. Please take the seed. 
Collect 13 Skulls of the Executed from powerful humanoid champions throughout Broken Isles, and bring them to the Executioner's Altar in the crypt near Morgan's Plot in Deadwind Pass.	The Grimoire of the First Necrolyte	This ancient tome appears to be the spellbook of Sataiel, the first necrolyte. Within its pages of curses and cantrips, you discover instructions for a ritual that Sataiel was concocting to empower Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester. She calls this ritual, ""The Rite of the Executioner.""The site was chosen and prepared, but Sataiel met her unfortunate end before she could proceed. Perhaps you can pick up where she left off? First, you'll need some skulls. 
Obtain a Vainglorious Draught from Veridis Fallon.	A Vainglorious Past	The Heart's magic is attuned to Azshara's elite through powerful warding spells. If we tried to tap into its power now we would be met only with our own demise. However, there may be a way we can bypass the wards. Prince Farondis and his court were once a part of Azshara's empire, and still hold on to keepsakes of their sordid past. Among these is sure to be a Vainglorious Draught, said to further bind the queen's followers to her will. See if you can convince the court to part with a bottle. 
Seek the Crest of Knowledge.	The Seat of the Triumvirate	Even with the Sigil of Awakening in hand, the Crown cannot save us until it is whole. That is why we must enter the Seat of the Triumvirate, even knowing that L'ura awaits us there. This is a dire task, one that I would not ask if it were not completely necessary. We will descend together. Come. 
Enter Shal'Aran and find something to sate Thalyssra's thirst.	Arcane Thirst	My people have subsisted on the Nightwell for millennia. Ancient mana is our lifeblood - without it, we become... well, you saw them out there.<Thalyssra holds her flask aloft, gently shaking free the last precious drops.>I'm afraid I have been rather reckless today. Already, my senses are dulling. Without magic to feed upon, I will turn. Please... find me something to feed upon... anything... 
Use the central teleporter in Dalaran and then place the Tears of Elune in the Portrait Room.	The Tears of Elune	The Tear of Elune floats effortlessly, glistening in an ethereal pillar of moonlight. 
Collect Purified Life Essence from the Emerald Dreamway.	The Stuff of Dreams	This arcan'dor is one of an ancient species. They were not bred, but created. In them the arcane and primitive druidic magics merged into something greater than both. The arcane will soon devour it whole. We can restore balance, but it will require wild magic. Magic trapped in another realm. You must enter the Emerald Dreamway and bring back the essence of life itself. Only then can the arcan'dor find stability and begin to thrive once more. 
Complete World Quests or slay Rare Elites on the Broken Shore to earn Legionfall War Supplies.	Legionfall Supplies	If we don't build up some respectable fortifications, we'll lose our foothold on the Broken Shore. That ain't gonna happen on my watch, mate! We started construction on three key structures: the Mage Tower, the Nether Disruptor, and the Command Center. Each will play a key role in helping us pound the tar out of the Burning Legion. To make progress, we need Legionfall War Supplies... and I mean lots of 'em! You bring 'em to me, and I'll handle distribution. Got it? 
Meet Mimiron at the Inventor's Library in the Storm Peaks.	Spark of Genius	George, I require your assistance. A recent energy signature tripped several detection relays I installed after that unfortunate incident with Sargeras. Initial diagnostics suggest that these energies emanate from Hati, a legendary creature of lightning magic. This wolf was linked to the Titanstrike artifact, a weapon that proved instrumental in defeating the Legion! Hati's spirit is still bound to Titanstrike's core, so I'll need your help. Meet me at my library in the Storm Peaks right away! 
Find and help Zantini and his pets along the coast of the Eye of Azshara.	Pet Up	It sounds like some group of pet poachers are up to no good in the Eye of Azshara. My supply manager's flight path takes him right over that area! Zantini and his pets, Strigfellow and Speedy IV, were bringing back a rare murloc pet, along with some other pets and supplies. George, please find Zantini and his pets. Help them out. Then we can try to recover the pets and the supplies. 
Find the Broken Leydar Dish and repair the leyline feed.	Leyline Feed: Ley Station Moonfall	<This leyline feed appears to be damaged. The large collector at the top is broken. The broken piece must be around here somewhere. There are rough scuff marks on the floor that appear to be made by something larger than the creatures inside. Much, much larger.> 
Complete any 4 world quests in Highmountain.	Highmountain Tribes	Assist the Tauren of Highmountain by completing 4 world quests. 
Bypass the wards in Felbreach Hollow and confront Raest Magespear.	Runes of Rending	My brother and his cultists are engaged in some kind of ritual at the far end of the cave. I tried to intervene, but my brother has left magical wards to block the way. If you can find a way past them, we may be able to stop him in time! 
	The Highlord's Return	I have a missive for you from Kor'vas, as well as instructions for getting you there. I can teleport you to them to begin the fight, but you will need some Nethershards to force your way into the Twisting Nether. When you have enough, speak with me and you can begin. 
Complete 8 World Quests on the Broken Shore.	Self-Fulfilling Prophecy	In my life, I have witnessed many visions. Some filled me with hope... others, with despair. Victory over Kil'jaeden lies within our grasp. I have foreseen it. But visions only show us where our path might lead. They require effort to become reality. That effort falls upon your shoulders, George. You have done much, but more is needed. Fight on the battlefields of the Broken Shore and forge a destiny free from the Legion's grasp! 
Send champions on missions to investigate the hunt.	"A ""Noble"" Event"	The invitation appears to be for an exclusive fox hunt. They plan to hunt Volpin, a rare, elusive fox somewhere in the Broken Isles. Perhaps we can take advantage of this? We need to gather more information about this hunt, but we should do so without alerting the Nightborne to your plans. Your champions can act in your stead and further investigate where the hunt will be. 
Investigate the ley line device at Kel'balor in the Crimson Thicket.	The Seal's Power	The Nightwell is so overloaded that they could not spare anything for this seal. Instead, they are borrowing power from the ley lines. I have traced one of their power sources to Kel'balor. We should head there immediately so I can determine how best to disable this barrier. Yes of course I said ""we."" Surely you do not expect me to go without my bodyguard, do you? I shall meet you there! 
Prove your worth to the Valarjar, then receive the Mark of the Valkyra from Eyir.	The Mark	Your blade is powerful, but it has not yet met its full potential. The all-powerful Odyn in the Halls of Valor can bestow upon you his strength. In order to seek this blessing, you must bring him a worthy tribute. I know where you may obtain such a gift, but in order to retrieve it you must first receive the mark of the Valkyra. Prove yourself worthy of our mark, champion, then you may enter the Vault of Eyir- the goddess will guide you from there. 
Power up the archive device and view the holographic record for the Trial of Will in the Terrace of the Watchers.	A Trial of Will	Upon the highest point of the plateau above, you will find the archive device for the Trial of Will. Seek it out to learn what awaits you in Thorim's Peak. Be on your guard, outsider. The one called Skovald has left behind many of his army, and they will no doubt be unfriendly. 
Complete the ""Moon Guard Stronghold"" storyline in Suramar, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.	Saving the Guard	The Moon Guard were once among the most powerful sorcerers on Azeroth. Most assumed their ranks demolished after the War of the Ancients, but it seems they have managed to survive in their ancient stronghold in Suramar! I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if they still oppose the Legion. George, if you can save what remains of the Guard, I will work to convince the Council of Six to lend us additional aid. 
Obtain 30 Blood of Sargeras.	Tempering Darkness	I do not doubt Senegos' plan, but I do have some concerns about the Heart's volatility, especially when combined with nightmare energy. Despite its name, Blood of Sargeras is often used as a tempering agent by master craftsmen. I believe it would work for our ritual as well. You should keep an eye out for it during your travels - we'll need a substantial amount to ensure that everything goes smoothly. 
Search the Broken Isles for the greatest axe wielding warrior you know.	Secrets of the Axes	Battlelord, I have a request. Find me inspiration! An axe whose form has seen a truly astounding amount of battle, wielded by one of the world's most powerful warriors. Both weapon and owner forged together in the crucible of war. Find this hero and their weapon, and convince them to come here. 
Enter a Lightforged Battery and slay 30 Frenzied Plaguewings.	Fire At Will	Look out there, the wings of the bats fill the sky. We must offer what ranged support we can, but our hands are full here. It looks like the Legion has not yet destroyed all of the artillery batteries. If you can get to one, you should be able to show those flying fiends the Light. 
Slay 8 Felborne and their leader, Valthis Ama'ran, at the Felborne Outpost in Crimson Thicket.	Felborne No More	The Felborne have begun to expand their grasp beyond the city's reach. A camp to the east in the Crimson Thicket is of a particular interest to us. Their outpost leader, Valthis Ama'ran, serves Andaris directly. Now is the time to put our withered training and Oculeth's device to the test. We cannot allow them to advance any further, George. Head for the camp and use the orb to sever the head of the beast. The time has come to begin our advance. 
Use the Branch of the Runewood to send 8 weakened Restless Ancestors back to the earth.	Lay Them to Rest	I would ask a favor, outsider. As you step through the graves of ancient heroes, you will no doubt come across spirits of the restless dead, agitated by the Bonespeakers misdeeds. They must be returned to the earth where they are buried, so that they may be judged as well. Take this bough - it carries with it the essence of the Runewood. Channel its power into a weakened spirit, and it will return to rest. 
Find Havi at Valdisdall.	A Call to Action	<As the raven stares into your eyes, a familiar voice fills your mind.>Champion, I require your aid. It seems Helya has shown her hand. Steel yourself then come to me. 
Slay 50 demons in Faronaar or Felsoul Hold.	Intolerable Infestation	While we purge Legion filth from the Broken Shore, the fiends maintain their hold on nearby lands. Their presence can no longer be tolerated. The fetid strongholds of Faronaar and Felsoul Hold infest Azsuna and Suramar. Choose an attack point and cut a swath through their insidious ranks. Return to me with demon blood on your hands, then we can resume our campaign to drive Kil'jaeden from the Tomb. 
Discover the purpose of the Mysterious Lightbound Object.	Bringer of the Light	Turalyon lives! For ages I had thought that my old friend had perished on some desolate Legion world. But to know that he yet lives and is in danger is too much to bear. We must hurry, George. We must uncover the object's sacred purpose. The prophet of whom Turalyon spoke of is undoubtedly the leader of the draenei, Velen. Take the object and journey to the Exodar. It is there that you will find Prophet Velen. I will open a portal for you now. Take my beacon and use it when you are ready to return. 
Seek out Ly'leth at the Grand Promenade.	Lady Lunastre	Our friend Ly'leth contacted me. She requested that you meet her atop the Grand Promenade as it overlooks the city. Have your disguise ready just in case, George. 
Obtain Odyn's blessing in the Halls of Valor on Mythic difficulty.	Halls of Valor: Odyn's Blessing	You are ready, Mechanic. Travel to Odyn's shining halls and offer the feast on the altar just inside. Mighty Odyn will then set his gaze upon you - you must pass the ancient trials of the Valarjar under his watch. Only then will you receive Odyn's blessing. 
Find and battle the leader of the pet poachers.	Gurgl and the Bandit	We've got all the pets back except Gurgl. George, we need to get that pet back for Breanni. Stringfellowe saw a nook where we think the leader of these pet poachers is hiding out. Let's get 'em! 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Nath'raxas Breakout"".	Nath'raxas Hold: Rescue Mission	Your forces are adequately equipped for the mission to save my people from Nath'raxas. Order your champions to bolster my assault, and together we will dismantle the Legion's stranglehold over the region. 
Speak to Arluin.	Or Against Us	If Ly'leth is to achieve the role of advisor to the Grand Magistrix we will need to open a path for her. It is true she will have some supporters but they alone cannot grant her the title. There are other houses that Ly'leth must contend with. Fear and coercion are their tools. None dare stand against them openly, and we cannot win them over with favors and oaths. Seek out Arluin. I trust he will have some ideas of how to proceed. 
Find the nightfallen that entered Leyhollow.	Cursed to Wither	So Cedonu said he saw nightfallen going into Leyhollow? I don't like the sound of that. Grandfather seems to be holding his own, but the archmage and I will keep an eye on him. You go investigate our caves. 
Approach the indicated location before the Crucible of the Uncrowned and raise your weapon.	A Hero's Weapon	I'm pleased to say that the improvements to the crucible are complete! When you are prepared, we shall use it to unlock the true potential of your weapons! 
Find Havi near Aggramar's Vault.	The Ancient Trials	<As the raven stares into your eyes, an odd voice fills your mind.>I know who you are, champion, and I know what you seek. Come to me, if you think yourself truly worthy. 
Search near the Xenedar for someone with knowledge of the Sealed Missive.	The Mysterious Missive	<On the body, you find a missive emblazoned with the seal of the Army of the Light. If the messenger was killed to prevent the letter's delivery, its contents must be of great import.> 
Find the corpses of Nyellus Starweaver, Galar'thus Rivertree, and Kailea Windfeather and perform funereal rites for them.	Fate of the Guard	<Thalrenus looks you over.>You are not one of them. The Nightborne came to our gates hours after the shield over Suramar fell. We thought them friends, despite our long separation. We were wrong. They poured into our stronghold and began the slaughter. We were unprepared. Though we fought, we were beaten. The keep is lost. Our leaders have perished and their corpses lay in the streets. Find them, give them their final rites. While you search, look for survivors. Help them if you can. 
Complete 4 Wardens world quests.	The Wardens	Assist the Wardens by completing 4 world quests. 
	Holding the Spire	 
Defeat Agatha.	Unlikely Seduction	Mo... Modera sent you? No... you must... leave! Agatha will be back any moment! Save... yourself... 
Collect 5 Fragmented Prayers.	Arkhaan's Prayers	<As you near the statue, a somber voice fills your mind.>""You must resist the shadow's pull. Come to me, brothers and sisters. Be whole within the Light. Let Arkhaan show you the way home.""<The rest of the message is garbled, though the nearby broken seem to be gnawing on pieces of the statue.> 
Activate the Astravar Beacon.	Staging Point	That is quite a corridor you and our allies have punched through the city. It will be difficult to hold but it will cut a wedge in Elisande's forces. Oculeth has been busy redirecting a telemancy beacon to this location but wanted to give you the honor of activating it. 
Mount upon Ebonfang and search for the Fangs of Ashamane.	The Fangs of Ashamane	I have to admit, Verstok was right. The shrine was too easy of a target for the Burning Legion to attack. Still, he's gone and the Fangs are with him. We're going to have to track him down for you to recover the Fangs. I should come with you but I have to stay with my people should we be attacked again. Here, my companion Ebonfang has a sense of smell like no other. He will be able to guide you to wherever Verstok is hiding. Also take this shell, through it we can communicate. May Elune guide you. 
Slay 3 Duskwatch Orbitists.	All Along the Waterways	I've noticed some wandering eyes, lately. I am more than happy to continue delivering the goods to Vanthir, but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so. The Duskwatch that walk the bazaar are by far the most observant. Find and slay the Orbitists so that I may deliver the goods safely. I will follow behind with the shipment. 
Investigate the cave that Excavator Karla told you about.	The Motherlode	Pst... Come 'ere! I just got a tip about a cave on this island that is a treasure trove of loot! This could be my biggest score yet. Problem is, I uhh... sprained my ankle. Yeah, I would be right there with you battling those demons to get this treasure, but I shouldn't be putting any weight on this leg of mine. Shucks. How about you go check on this cave and report back to me. I'll mark your map where the cave entrance is. I've been told it's pretty hidden, so you've got to look around. 
Leave Felsoul Advance on Deline's Gondola.	Waning Refuge	We have done all we can here. Let us get everyone into the boat and get out while we still can. We have bought time for the others but nothing more. 
Feed Theryn 300 Ancient Mana.	Arcane Communion	All of Kel'danath's experiments to connect with the withered failed, and some even made them more dangerous. Until he found Theryn. His arcane essence - the very soul of the shal'dorei - had been touched by something special. But what? By weaving my arcane essence together with Theryn's, I can create an empathic bond. This communion will bare his soul to us all - or what's left of it. We need only to feed him mana, and lots of it, in order to begin. 
Return to Thalyssra	And They Will Tremble	There will be consequences for what has transpired this day. For now, you should return to Thalyssra. Tell her that we have avenged Margaux and that the Dusk Lily has announced itself to all of Suramar. There will be many more deaths before this is over, rest assured, but this is a death that will teach others like Durant to tread more carefully in the future. 
	Stelleris Shakedown	 
Complete the construction of the Mage Tower.	The Mage Tower	Well done George. In testament to the efforts of all forces fighting here, we have come together to complete the construction of the Mage Tower. All that remains is for you to inspect our work, and complete the construction. 
Speak with Turalyon.	Sizing Up The Opposition	No doubt your High Exarch will fret at the news that we lack the resources to assault Antorus. He is not used to believing his vaunted Army of the Light to be inadequate. His pride is no concern of mine. While he plots a new strategy, I will bathe the ground in demon blood. Go. There is much to be done before we can achieve our final victory. 
Speak with Xylem's apprentices in Bear's Head to decipher the code to open the barrier to his tower.	Order of Incantations	The barrier shielding the tower can only be opened by activating the imbued gems in the correct order. The order is only known to Xylem and his inner circle of apprentices. No others have yet been able to decipher the code, and mistakes are met with deadly consequences. The aspiring apprentices spend a lot of their time around the tower. Some may have seen or heard something that might point to a solution. Let us hope, for your sake, their information proves valuable. 
Activate the teleporter pad and bring Vanthir's gift to Thalyssra.	Friends On the Outside	You have done well for us here, but it is time for you to return to Thalyssra. There is a teleporter pad nearby that has gone unused in recent years. See if you can reroute it and return to her that way. Oh, and before you go:<Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of Arcwine.>Take this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child. We are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now. 
Hide in the basket and wait for the guard to appear. Follow the guard to their destination.	Shift Change	This is as good a chance as we are going to get to rescue Verene's daughter. Here is how this is going to work. You are going to wait here for the guard to pass by on their way to their guard shift. Look for something to hide in.<Silgryn marks a spot on your map.>You will know the guard by their bright red armor. Follow closely, but not so closely that you are seen. It may be necessary to kill the guard when you reach your destination. The child's name is Korine. Good luck. 
Collect 4 Engorged Bear Hearts from Voracious Bears in the Runewood.	Bjornharta	The afterlife leaves the dead hungry for the delicacies of their former lives. For the vrykul kings, none such offering is prized more than Bjornharta - a celebratory feast of an engorged bear heart. The bears of the Runewood eat well, and have long been prized for their tender meat. Hunt them and find a suitable heart of offer to the ancient rulers. They will not be able to resist such an offering. 
	Instructor Tarahna	 
	The Fallen Ones	 
Leave Moon Guard Stronghold with Thalrenus, Lothrius, and Syrana.	Last Stand of the Moon Guard	This is all that remains of the Moon Guard. Take a good look. We are but a shadow of our former selves, and we have the Nightborne to thank for our demise. For now there is nothing more we can do. If we want to live, we must leave immediately. Retribution can wait. 
	The God-Queen's Fury	Mechanict, the Kirin Tor have found a way to get you into the Halls of Valor to pursue the God-King's heir. Archmage Khadgar has asked me to stress upon you the importance of stopping Sigryn, as the prophecies hint that she may still be the key to uniting the Tideskorn against the Legion. It will require an incredible amount of energy to teleport you directly to the Halls, so be sure that you are prepared. It may be some time before we can send you again. Speak to me when you are ready to proceed. 
Find Arcanist Kel'danath's hideout in Ambervale.	An Old Ally	I was on my way to Ambervale in hopes of finding an old colleague. Arcanist Kel'danath was fascinated by the withered. He studied them for years hoping to calm their feral nature or even cure them. When one of his subjects escaped and ran amok in the royal gardens, Kel'danath was ordered to cease his research and kill all withered in his possession. He refused, and was exiled. If Kel'danath lives, he is near withered. And withered are drawn to old settlements like Ambervale. 
Follow Thalyssra while she explores Shal'Aran.	Shal'Aran	The chamber beyond may be the perfect hiding place, now that its guardian has been dealt with. Come with me. 
Collect 7 Challenger's Tributes from Valley of the Sword.	Blood and Gold	The challengers gathered in the Valley of the Sword have brought with them offerings to the watchers of the vault. It might be a good idea to take some of these offerings with you to help in appeasing Yotnar. 
Use Khadgar's Wand to find Arcane Echoes and track down First Arcanist Thalyssra.	Trail of Echoes	The Nightborne could prove powerful allies against the Legion. We must aid this Thalyssra if we can. We should be able to find her by tracking her magical echoes, the same way I found her distress call. I can teleport you near the location where she recorded that message. From there, you must search for ripples in the very fabric of the arcane itself. My wand should do the trick. Follow the sparks it creates--they should lead you to places where Thalyssra used her magic. 
Help the Postmaster sort at least 15 letters within the time limit.	The Mail Must Flow	Due to all of the recent shenanigans, I'm running short on mailementals to sort letters. It's a simple job, really - just toss the letter into the proper portal, where it will be whisked away to the far corners of Azeroth and beyond. I like to make a little game out of it. How many can you sort in one minute? 
	Harvesters of Sorrow	 
Search Thalyssra's estate and collect 3 Amplifier Fragments. Combine them into an Arcane Amplifier.	Thalyssra's Abode	While you were busy in the city I reached a roadblock in my withered research. I feel I am close to overcoming this barrier, but I'm afraid I cannot do so without some more advanced tools. I hid among my possessions an item called an Arcane Amplifier. It does precisely what its name entails. It is more than likely that the Magistrix ordered my estate dismantled. If the Amplifier remains, it will be in fragments. Recover the whole, if you can. 
Reach ""Timehopper"" friendship rank with Chromie in Dragonblight.	Chromie	George. Is that you? I'm convinced that something unusual has happened in the timelines. I need your help! Come find me at Wyrmrest Temple, in Dragonblight, and I'll show you. 
Speak with Ly'leth to begin the encounter.	Ly'leth's Champion	Tal'ashar is an honor duel. If I lose, then I must forfeit my title to Coryn Stelleris.<Ly'leth smiles gently.>That is why you are going to fight for me. I will grant you a more powerful disguise for this task, and together we will put Coryn in his place. Speak to me when you are ready to battle on my behalf. 
Defeat the hidden infiltrators in Dalaran.	Enemies Everywhere	Hold a moment, George. While I look into this orb of yours, why don't you look into something for me? I have long suspected an infiltration of Dalaran but after an embarrassing encounter with a local florist I've withheld my accusations until I'm absolutely certain. Have you noticed citizens among us that seem just too mundane? Almost inhumanly so? Spies, serving dark masters, watch and wait until our backs are turned. Root them out, but try and keep it quiet. 
	Left for Dead	 
Use the Spellstone of Kel'danath to charm 5 withered and send them to Shal'Aran.	Kel'danath's Legacy	Kel'danath discovered something incredible - the power to subdue and even control the withered. I will pick up where my old friend left off. We shall see to it that he did not die in vain. Perhaps in the end we can even find peace for the wretches who have been left to a fate worse than death. I will need more subjects. Take Kel'danath's spellstone and use it to subdue more withered. 
Watch as Gaal reforges the Armory Key.	Forging a Key to the Past	The armory key fragments are gathered, and the dendrite clusters should provide just enough power to reforge the key. This should not take long... assuming it works. It has been a long time since I made one of these! 
Complete any 4 world quests in Azsuna.	Court of Farondis	Assist the Court of Farondis in Azsuna by completing 4 world quests. 
Collect the heads of the Gutspill, Rumblehoof, and Felskorn champions in Valley of the Sword.	Ahead of the Game	The watcher Yotnar keeps the vault, and he is a fickle one. Challengers come from far and wide seeking the trials, but the watcher chooses not to see. If you wish to catch his eye, show him you are worth being seen. Some of these challengers await in camps throughout the Valley of the Sword. Bring their heads to Yotnar, so that he may see them, and you. 
Obtain a Mana Focus from the Mana Devourer within Karazhan	Return to Karazhan: Cubic Cynosure	Drat! The ancient mana doesn't seem to be working. I need to think the problem through, focus and...Wait, that's it! Focus! We need to focus the energy of the ancient mana to activate the cube. I've heard tell of a mana wyrm in Karazhan with the means to focus its powers. Might be just what we need! Watch out, though. My sources tell me this wyrm is humongous! 
Investigate the Azurewing Whelplands.	The Last of the Last	We need help. Since the fall of Deathwing, we dragons have lost nearly all of our power. To make matters worse, we can no longer bear eggs. My whelplings are the last of the last. I need you, champion. Help defend my whelplands, and I swear to you, the blues will be at your side when you need them. 
Collect the Fanciful Hat, Well-Tailored Robes, and Magnificent Mantle from Raethas Dawnseer, Lobos and Phloem in Azshara.	Professionally Good Looking	The archmage has recently locked himself away in his tower. If you wish to enter, you'll need help from some of his apprentices. I'm afraid you won't get it dressed like that. Xylem has a thing for... outfits, and his apprentices use them to show rank. If you wish his apprentices to help you, you'll need to appear their superior. Such is their desire to impress the archmage, many of his apprentices will battle each other for the best pieces. I think you know where this is going. 
	Imp Mother Laglath	 
Complete 3 Kirin Tor world quests.	The Kirin Tor of Dalaran	Assist the Kirin Tor of Dalaran by completing 3 world quests. 
	Turek the Lucid	 
Collect 6 Leyline Feed Fragments and infuse the feed with ancient mana.	Leyline Feed: Ley Station Aethenar	<This leyline appears to be damaged and needs repair. Several large chunks of the main column are missing and arcane energy is crackling in the gaps. The elementals nearby seem to pick up debris and absorb it into their bodies as they move around. Maybe they have the missing pieces...> 
Acquire 20 Bottles of Arcwine.	Redistribution	I would imagine you thought I would simply have wine to deliver.<Deline chuckles.>If it were that easy, his people would not be starving.<Her expression becomes serious.>These... loyalists, shall we say, enjoy abundance. They dance to the Magistrix's whims and so they have all that they need. There is no Arcwine shortage. The Magistrix created one to keep us in line. They will not miss a few bottles. They have plenty. Search the square and bring as much as you can carry back. 
Destroy the Soul Harvester.	Lyana Darksorrow	<Your fellow Illidari, Lyana Darksorrow, floats captive in stasis in front of you; her soul slowly draining into the harvester crystal.><In order to release her from stasis, you will need to destroy the soul harvester.> 
	Closing the Eye	We have received reports from the apprentices at Xylem's Tower that they've been able to use the remant of Xylem's portal to pinpoint his location. We have orders from the Council of Six to open a portal directly to him, though whatever magic he's channeling on the other end is powerful enough to allow us to only keep it open for a brief window. The apprentice, Joanna asked I give you this message before you proceed. Speak to me when you're ready. 
Use the Dreamway to travel to Mount Hyjal, then cleanse G'Hanir in the sacred waters beneath Nordrassil.	Cleansing the Mother Tree	We must save the Mother Tree at all costs. I believe I know a way. The world tree Nordrassil, atop Mount Hyjal, was born from an acorn of G'Hanir. We can use the sacred waters surrounding its roots to purify the corruption. If we take the Dreamway to Mount Hyjal's summit we should have enough time to complete the cleansing ritual before G'Hanir falls completely to the darkness. 
Claim 5 Lingering Soul Fragments from the final bosses of Legion dungeons. Higher difficulty dungeons provide a greater chance and quantity of Lingering Soul Fragments.	Soul Prism of the Illidari	Alas, I will not burden you with the location of the master's soul just yet, George. First we must craft a soul prism powerful enough to hold the master's boundless chaotic energies. To do this I require lingering soul fragments from powerful beings found across this world. Bring me enough and I will craft a soul prism capable of holding the soul of the master - at least long enough to transfer into the naaru. 
	Cleansing Fire	 
	An Impossible Foe	George! We have just received word from the Council of Six. They have found Agatha! Modera asked that she be able to brief you through this image crystal. Good luck! 
Use the Mask of Mirror Image on Anarys Lunastre.	Masquerade	Our family commands great respect in this city, thanks to my father. Through my network of contacts, we can organize the citizens to prepare Suramar for Thalyssra's return. You must walk among the nightborne. You must earn the trust of our friends and foes alike. You must become someone else.<Ly'leth hands you a shimmering party mask.>Put this on Anarys. 
	Ana-Mouz	 
Speak to Warbrave Oro at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran.	The Lone Mountain	Our sources tell us that a Highmountain tauren emissary has recently arrived in Dalaran. We don't know his intentions, but his people could be an invaluable contact in the region. Khadgar is greeting the emissary at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran - you should seek him out. 
Charge the Moon Seal, Star Seal, Beast Seal and Elven Seal in Ley Station: Tel'Anor.	Power Grid	This station has fallen into disrepair. The circuit is broken, and to mend it we must recharge the seals in the central chamber. Both a high potency current and low potency current are needed for each seal. Direct the currents to point at the same seal, then engage the seal. Me? I shall supervise. You are the help, after all. 
Complete any 4 world quests in Stormheim.	The Valarjar	Assist the Vry'kul of Stormheim by completing 4 world quests. 
Begin the assault on the Broken Shore.	Begin the Assault	The battle for our world has been hard fought, but with the power of your weapon and the combined forces of Azeroth, we have driven the demon invaders back at every turn. Now we stand once again upon the Broken Shore, poised to do that which we previously failed to accomplish. Let us not forget those who sacrificed everything to give us this chance. Our first objective is to take the hill before us, so that we may build a stronghold. Steel yourself, George. The assault on the Broken Shore begins now. 
Use the Navigation Console to travel to the Antoran Wastes.	The Burning Heart	The loss of Xe'ra is a blow, especially to Turalyon. But even the Light Mother could not be allowed to force destiny upon us. I wish Illidan had found another way to refuse her... but I too have had choices imposed upon me by the naaru. This must not distract us from our mission. Now that we have the Army of the Light survivors with us, it is time to press our attack. We need a foothold on the Antoran Wastes from which we can assault the Burning Throne. It is time to deprive Sargeras of his prize! 
Meet Mayla Highmountain at Thunder Totem in Highmountain.	Keepers of the Hammer	The Highmountain Tribes had intended to pledge our allegiance to your forces. We know war has come with the Burning Legion. However, we have been betrayed from within and must now ask for your aid. A great relic, the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, was stolen from our people by the vile drogbar. We need your help in recovering it. 
Bring one of Gul'dan's eyes to Archmage Kalec on Normal difficulty or higher.	The Nighthold: Darkness Calls	Before we perform the ritual there is one last thing I must ask of you, George. You must finally bring Gul'dan to justice. No more of his lies, his deceits, or his trickery. None of it can save him now. Take one of his conjured eyes when you're done. Using his power for good will be a fitting end. 
Meet Hamuul Runetotem at the Moonglade.	A Summons From Moonglade	George, Your presence is requested at Moonglade at once. We are preparing for a ritual of great importance and will require your assistance. I will meet you there, so please come with haste. 
Speak with Silgryn in the Suramar Outskirts.	Sympathizers Among the Shal'dorei	Elisande's decision to welcome the Legion into Suramar earned her plenty of enemies, though only some of us were bold enough to openly defy her. We have allies in the city - we just don't know how many. I need you to make contact with a spell-fencer by the name of Silgryn. He is loyal to our cause, and has been lying in wait since our failed coup. He patrols the western edge of the city. Address him by name and tell him our cause is not lost! 
Gather from 3 Ancient Mana nodes.	Ancient Mana	Without the Nightwell to feed upon, my comrades and I will have to live off the land itself. Ancient mana from the underground leylines can reach the surface in many forms, most commonly as crystals or gems.<Thalyssra picks up a small stone and, whispering words of power, traces a rune upon it with her fingertip.>This stone will glow when ancient mana is nearby. Please gather as much as possible! It will be a precious resource in the weeks to come. 
Bring the compass to King Anduin Wrynn in Stormwind Keep.	A Found Memento	<The trinket's fine brass exterior is inlaid with intricate filigree, though much of the detail has been battered by rocks and waves. Clearing away the grime and salt encrusting the clasp, you manage to open it. It is a compass--or was, at least. The glass face is shattered, the needle bent, unmoving. Set into the lid is a portrait. The paint is faded and waterlogged, but the subject is unmistakable: the face of a young Anduin Wrynn.> 
Examine the Arcane Anomaly in Dalaran.	Magic Message	For the last 10,000 years, the elven city of Suramar has been sealed in an arcane barrier, much like Dalaran once was. That barrier has come down. Since then, waves of magical energy have been emanating from the city like ripples in a pond. It was in these waves that I sensed a pattern. A spell, encrypted among the chaos. I have recreated the spell here. It's not dangerous, but beyond that... I have no idea what it does! 
Complete the ""Nightfall"" and ""Moon Guard Stronghold"" storylines in Suramar, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.	Focusing Our Efforts	The Nightfallen in Suramar were once a part of the Nightborne, but have been exiled by their former brethren and cut off from the Nightwell. I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if you can turn them to our side. I know only that they have gone into hiding somewhere in Suramar. Afterward, seek out the Moon Guard in the northern reaches of Suramar. They, too, could be valuable allies in our cause... if they still oppose the Legion as they once did many years ago. 
Inspect 6 pages of Kel'danath's Notes.	Scattered Memories	<As your fingers trace the elegant symbols on the page, a voice dictates the words in your mind. It seems the nightborne have elevated even simple note-taking to a sorcerous art. Arcanist Kel'danath was definitely working in this area. There must be more of his notes scattered around.> 
Assault Dargrul the Underking.	The Underking	Mayla already chased the Underking into his cave. That is something we tell our children never to do. Reckless child, but hey, who wants to live forever? Let us join her in battle. 
Defeat the Legion siege on Vengeance Point and report to Izal Whitemoon.	Vengeance Point	On my way here, I ran across a squad of demon hunters headed northwest to Vengeance Point. You can bet the Legion will try to stop them from establishing a forward position. I spoke to an elf named Izal Whitemoon. Not the friendliest sort, but I'm sure she'd be grateful if you lent the Illidari a hand... whether she admits it or not. 
Travel to Argus aboard the Vindicaar.	Into the Night	What we do this day, we do for Azeroth. For the countless souls lost to the Legion's foul crusade. Once you are ready we will take the Vindicaar into the very heart of the Legion. Argus awaits. 
Travel to Eredath.	A Floating Ruin	We knew the Legion to be a formidable foe, but recent events demonstrate that we do not possess the necessary strength to continue. We have come too far to fail at this critical moment. I know of a relic on Eredath, my ancient home, that may be our salvation. We must take the Vindicaar beyond the surface of Argus, to the floating ruin suspended above us. Perhaps there we will find the salvation we so desperately need. 
Meet Magni in Sholazar Basin and hear the warning.	Whispers of a Frightened World	""Champion! Azeroth needs our help.""<Magni Bronzebeard's words echo in your mind, as if rising from somewhere deep and ancient. Azeroth's world soul seeks to deliver a warning to the Speaker, but some force is interfering with the message.><Magni has urged you to travel to Sholazar Basin, the vibrant heart of frozen Northrend, to aid him.> 
	Clear the Catacombs	 
Obtain the Scroll of Elun'dris from First Arcanist Thalyssra.	Lost Knowledge	We are indeed familiar with the Nightborne's magic, but we were never allowed access to the Heart. It was a right reserved only for the Queen's favored. However, we can still learn how to properly tap its magic. Thousands of years ago, a Nightborne scholar studied the Heart and documented his findings in great detail. He was executed and the scroll of his writings banned, but the Nightfallen secreted it away in their escape. If you obtain the scroll, we can help you. 
Complete Greymane's mission aboard the Skyfire.	Greymane's Gambit	The Skyfire is prepared to make way to Stormheim. Should we become engaged, I will require my best fighters on the front line. This includes you, Mechanic. 
Journey to Snowblind Mesa.	Battle of Snowblind Mesa	Your timing is fortunate. Our forces at Snowblind Mesa report seeing the Underking above ground. What is more, he is lightly guarded, and has the hammer with him. Thanks to your efforts, we can meet them in battle. Meet us at Snowblind Mesa and let us take the fight to Dargrul together. 
Fill a Vial of Moonwell Water and locate Lea Stonepaw within Grizzly Hills.	To The Hills	It is said that a fragment of Ursoc's spirit, his fury and rage, remained within the claws after his death. Only those who have attained mastery of discipline have any hope of wielding them without being overwhelmed by the bear lord's fury.<Lea looks intently at you for a moment.>But you are no novice, I can see that clearly. Very well, draw water from the moonwell on the northern edge of the grove then come find me. I'll await your arrival within the broken stump of Vordrassil in Northrend. 
Look for the rumored treasure in the Soul Ruins.	Grave Robbin'	I am not a grave robber, but is it technically grave robbing if the treasure is sitting on a field of bones? It's not like it's buried or nothin'. I'm just gonna sit this one out, just in case. 
Imbue the inert waters with the ritual bundle, then witness the well's creation.	Eminent Grow-main	You have done very well, Human. All that is left is to combine their blessings into the ritual bundle and imbue the Moonwell. Once that is done, Mayruna will add a little water from a purified Moonwell and this land will be protected so long as we inhabit it. This is a momentous occasion, my friend. You bear witness to a sacred rite not often performed in the company of strangers. I will let you do the honors- simply place the ritual bundle into the sacred waters and we will do the rest. 
Go through the portal to the Dreamgrove.	To The Dreamgrove	The portal to the Dreamway is open and it is here where our paths must part. The Moonglade remains vulnerable to the attacks of the Burning Legion and I must ensure it is well defended. I'm entrusting you with the mission to Val'sharah, George. Archdruid Greathoof is the leader of the druids there. He is wise in the old ways and will provide us invaluable assistance. The Dream can be dangerous so I will send Keeper Remulos to guide you. Meet with him upon the other side. 
Search the forge, the saber pens, and the guard tower.	Maiev's Trail	The fortress grounds are just up ahead. There is a large area to search, but if we split up, I believe we can cover a lot of ground. Search the prison cages, the forge, and the guard tower for any signs of Maiev. I will check the upper ramparts and meet you on the other side of the keep. 
	Titanic Innovation	 
Raise your weapon and receive the Council of Six's gift in the Violet Citadel.	A Gift From the Six	George, without you some of the Legion's strongest agents would still be roaming Azeroth, threatening to undermine all that we've accomplished in this war. Such a deed merits more than mere recognition. If you would accept it, we would like to formally reward your heroism in the face of such darkness with a portion of our power. 
Examine the Leyline Feed in Shal'Aran with Arcanist Valtrois.	Feeding Shal'Aran	With leyline energy feeding in from Anora, this chamber can begin to awaken. It will be a slow process, and we must take care to mask this activity from our enemies, a process which itself requires enormous effort and focus. Furthermore, there is the conundrum of actually consuming the mana in this form. A stream too weak is not enough to provide sustenance - too powerful and it would vaporize us. There is much work to be done yet. For now, let us examine the feed. 
Collect 4 Underglow Locusts.	Moths to a Flame	No doubt you have noticed our guests. I have watched them for a time and seen how they are attracted to the tree. I do not know if they are harmful to our sapling, but we cannot take that chance. Collect a handful of the insects and bring them to me. I will examine them and determine if they are to be left alone. 
Meet Magni in the Krokul Hovel.	The Speaker Calls	Magni sent for you to meet him in the Krokul Hovel. He has found something that he believes could help us overcome the Legion's infinite armies. We need every advantage we can muster if we are to see this war through. You should seek him out. 
Meet Archmage Kalec inside Shal'Aran in Suramar.	Repaid Debt	The Moon Guard fought against the Legion many years ago, during the War of the Ancients. Their intimate knowledge of our enemies would be invaluable to our cause. They have remained in Shal'Aran since you saved Thalrenus and his kin. Shall we pay them a visit and see what they can do? 
Meet Jale Rivermane at Earthmother's Bounty.	The Rivermane Tribe	What has happened here requires more time than I have to explain. In short, our tribes have scattered in the wake of the attack that left the Hammer of Khaz'goroth in the hands of the barbaric drogbar. Even now the drogbar are raiding the Rivermane tribe, and I have too few braves left to send to their aid. We need a hero. Please, go to Earthmother's Bounty and lend what aid you can. 
Slay the Cliffclutch Matriarch.	Feathersong's Redemption	I must confess I was not entirely honest with you, George. I meant to drink the potion and join my wife. And even she was taken from her rest... I cannot fail her again. I must live and do what I can to stop this coming storm to be worthy of joining her. Come, young one. Let us take care of the harpy matriarch and restore Tel'anor to its former glory. We cannot let this poison go to waste, eh? 
Use the Telemancy Beacon to survey the Ruins of Elune'eth.	Survey Says...	It is time to establish the first secure connection in our teleportation network. Take this beacon to the Ruins of Elune'eth above us and survey the area to find a suitable location. Once your survey is complete, place the beacon and I will anchor a connection to it from here. 
Kill Nightglaive the Traitor.	Dark Revelations	I'm not going to let Cordana Felsong get away with this. There is no way in hell I am going to let that warden witch turn my people. As for Nightglaive... I will NOT suffer a traitor to live! Are you with me, George? 
Kill Ael'Yith and his construct.	Hunger's End	I am weak. The hunger is devastating, my friend. I understand now why your dragon rests in these pools.<cough, cough>I came to warn you but... it looks like I was too late. I hear him outside now. Ael'Yith... is... here... 
Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey Evermoon Commons, Evermoon Bazaar, and Siren's Vigil in Suramar City.	Bring Home the Beacon	The conduit we need is in the Arcway, and security in the Arcway has doubled since your last visit. Our only reasonable option is to teleport your strike team directly in. This is a long-range teleport to a non-anchored destination. In other words, it will be hard. Take this beacon and survey the commons in Suramar City, then return the beacon to me so I can analyze the results. This will help me teleport you as close as possible to the conduit! 
Travel to the Antoran Wastes and place the Lightforged Beacon.	Securing a Foothold	Alleria and I have scouted this area before, alongside some of our best soldiers. We stationed encampments on either side of our current position, but I fear they will have come under heavy attack. They need reinforcements. Our first order of business is to set up a teleportation beacon directly below the Vindicaar. From there, we will have access to both fronts. Speak to Romuul when you are ready to head down to the surface. 
Defeat Azoran in Felsoul Hold.	Azoran Must Die	You won't have much time before the Legion is aware of your presence on the ship. When the alarm is raised, countless Burning Legion forces will attempt to board the ship through this portal. I will not let them succeed. I will guard this portal from enemy reinforcements until you return. It is up to you to slay Azoran and lay waste to his ship. We don't have much time... you must attack swiftly and without mercy. 
Collect the Weathered Telemancy Beacon and Cracked Warpsleeve from Oculeth's Workshop.	The Delicate Art of Telemancy	I hadn't the time to gather my instruments before fleeing the palace. I came here to salvage some equipment. This old workshop is actually several rooms connected by teleporter pads. Elisande's goons are already scouring the place looking for me, but from here I can alter the teleporter network and keep them moving in circles. You go in. I'll monitor your position and ensure the teleporters work normally for you. Find these two parts and bring them back! 
Obtain a Deathglare Iris and the Horn of the Nightmare Lord from the Emerald Nightmare on Normal difficulty or higher.	The Emerald Nightmare: In Nightmares	We must do what we can to ensure that the Nightmare never again festers within the Emerald Dream. The aberration known as Il'gynoth lies at the heart of the corruption - a living, writhing manifestation of the horrors you will encounter at every turn of your journey. I ask that you ensure its destruction, along with the Nightmare Lord himself... Xavius. Once the deeds have been done, bring a small piece of each to me. We can study them to figure out just how the Nightmare grew so quickly. 
Find Lothrius' first edition copy of ""Wards, Sigils, and the Nightborne Way"" in the Court of Stars on Mythic difficulty.	Court of Stars: Literary Perfection	Out of all the books, why that one?! Oh, Mother Moon, I am but a trusting fool. I apologize, you have no idea what I'm going on about. I lent my first edition copy of ""Wards, Sigils, and the Nightborne Way"" to a dear friend - well, former friend, I should say - just before the betrayal. As fate would have it, there is an incantation in that book that I will need for my part of the ritual. Please retrieve it if you can, but be careful - it is quite valuable! 
Speak with Heidirk the Scalekeeper at Aalgen Point.	Aalgen Point	You wanna hold territory on this chunder puddle of an island, right? Right. That means linkin' up with camps on the outskirts, mate. I know this bloke called Heidirk. Scrappy fella, loves to get into the thick of it. Headed out to the eastern coast with those drakes of his. Have a look for him. Remind him he owes me a pint or two! 
Recreate Arrexis' ritual in Faronaar and defeat Balaadur.	The Mage Hunter	And with that, we have what we need to recreate the ritual... however flawed it may be. It must be conducted somewhere highly visible so that word reaches our target swiftly. I've heard reports that the Legion is heavily invested in the Faronaar region of Azsuna. An excellent place to begin a ritual they won't want us to complete. The chances of us dying horribly are exceptionally high. 
Collect the core of Trilliax and Grand Magistrix Elisande's Millennia Tome in the Nighthold on Normal difficulty or higher.	The Nighthold: Delusions of Grandeur	Grand Magistrix Elisande and her cohorts have lost their minds - they truly believe that allying themselves with the Legion will end in anything but their own demise! They are too far gone to save, I'm afraid, but they still have powerful items that we can use to help us infuse the Heart of Zin-Azshari with their power. In your assault on the Nighthold, ensure you recover the mad construct Trilliax's power core, as well as the spellbook of the Grand Magistrix herself. Good luck. 
Defend the Leyline Feed and infuse it with Ancient Mana.	Leyline Feed: Kel'balor	<This feed appears to draw power from the leyline in order to become fully operational. You should be able to imbue it with mana, but it will take a few minutes to draw enough leyline energy to accept the infusion. Beware, for creatures may notice the surge of arcane energy...> 
Collect Sixtrigger's Key from Rax Sixtrigger in Stormheim.	Time to Collect	Hey there, pal. My sources around here say you had a run-in with the Sixtrigger brothers. I'd imagine you're not very happy with them? Let's just say we're not exactly friends either. So I'll tell you what. How about I let you in on some intel about their current location? Maybe they might have an unfortunate accident, you follow? Oh, and bring some friends. They're not exactly the easiest of targets. 
Dissuade 5 Lingering Moonfall Hippogryphs	Not Their Last Stand	I've been watching you- you are not with them.<Ivanel coughs quietly.>I am not long for this world, but there is one thing I would have you do while you are here. The hippogryphs here still fight bitterly to defend their home and their companions in the Moon Guard. They have not accepted that the Guard is no more. Please... send them away. Let them know there is nothing left for them to fight for here. 
Retrieve both Bindings of the Windlord and 10 Infernal Brimstone.	Bindings of the Windlord	With Thunderaan risen again as the lord of Skywall, there may indeed be an arrangement you can make in exchange for those wretched implements. But one binding is of no use on its own. Return to me with both bindings, and with powerful enough ore to bind them, and I will arrange your audience with Thunderaan the Windlord. 
Fly with Vethir and kill 150 of the God-King's allies in Hrydshal.	Cry Thunder!	You have proven yourself an ally of the Thorignir and we will lend you our strength. I would ask one last favor of our new champion, though. The dragon who guided you to me awaits his vengeance against the vrykul. Together I wish for you to show these Drekirjar what it means to cross the Thorignir. Be they Felskorn or not, their malice has caused suffering to my brood. Their toll must be paid in blood. Speak to Vethir when you are ready. 
Enter the Emerald Dream and retrieve G'Hanir.	In Deep Slumber	This bed will be yours for the deep slumber that will usher you into the Dream. Once you are comfortable, drink of the moonwater you brought. I will guide you from there. Quickly, now - with every passing moment G'Hanir slips further into darkness. 
Speak with Lasan Skyhorn at the base of Thunder Totem.	The Skies of Highmountain	When you are ready, join me at the base of Thunder Totem. I would be honored to have you at my side as my tribe once again swears its allegiance to the young Mayla. Together, we are Highmountain! 
	DANGER: Kosumoth the Hungering	 
Recover a Corrupted Essence from Oakheart and defeat the Shade of Xavius in Darkheart Thicket on Mythic difficulty.	Darkheart Thicket: Fallen Power	Once we have the proper implements we can use the Heart to infuse great power into your artifact. We need only a source. Deep within the Darkheart Thicket lies the ancient Oakheart, once a great and mighty protector of Shaladrassil. He has regrettably fallen to the nightmare like so many of his kin. As the darkness within him has taken root, an essence of the corruption has manifested. I ask that you recover the essence so that we may draw from its power, and put noble Oakheart to rest. 
Collect 3 Vestiges of Light.	Essence of the Light Mother	This is a crucial moment, George. Our campaign must not lose momentum. Though she has fallen, I still sense Xe'ra's presence all around us. The Light that shone within her heart can yet be a source of strength for our cause. No doubt the loss of Xe'ra has deeply wounded Turalyon. I will do what I can to ease his troubled spirit while you gather the vestiges of the naaru that remain. 
Retrieve 4 Adamantium Casing Scraps and defeat Dargrul the Underking in Neltharion's Lair on Mythic difficulty.	Neltharion's Lair: Presentation is Key	Odyn will demand a feast worthy of the ancient trials you must complete; a feast's merit begins not at the great beasts piled upon it, but at the dish used to serve it. Deep beneath Highmountain lies the former lair of Neltharion - you may know the infernal drake better as Deathwing. You will find remnants of the adamantium plating used to hold his molten skin together in the deepest recesses of his lair. They will form a fine dish for the feast. 
Give the First Arcanist's Token to Chief Telemancer Oculeth.	Oculeth's Workshop	We need to make contact with Chief Telemancer Oculeth, the man who developed Suramar's teleportation network. Oculeth had a workshop in old Suramar, from the age before the Sundering. He may be taking refuge there.<Thalyssra presses a small coin into your palm.>If you find him, show him this. Hopefully you see him before he sees you... 
	Stand Up to Bullies	 
Use the Royal Summons and follow Sky Admiral Rogers through the portal to Stormwind Harbor.	A Royal Summons	Well met, $p. I have come on behalf of King Anduin Wrynn. My crew is preparing for a special mission, and the king would like you to join us. Please review this official summons and, if you are satisfied, return with me to Stormwind Harbor.<Rogers hands you a sealed envelope.> 
Find Torvald in Vrekt.	The Forgotten Heir	My brother... lives? The last time I saw him, the assassins were closing in on him. I can't imagine how he defeated them...We should travel to Vrekt. I would look upon my brother with my own eyes. 
	Thwarting the Twins	I have news from Archmage Karlain! The Kirin Tor have found Raest Magespear and can open up a portal to his location! If you are ready to face him, I can have the mages here open the portal into the Twisting Nether. 
Look for the rumored treasure in the Creeping Grotto.	Spiders, Huh?	I feel like they're still crawling all over me. I squished one egg and all of a sudden I'm covered head to toe in baby spiders.<Shivers>. That treasure is just sitting there now. The next guy better not be arachnaphlipic... arachnaphonetic? Arachniphant? Afraid of spiders! 
Slay Leyworms to obtain 6 Crackling Leyworm Cores, then drop them into Senegos's pool.	The Death of the Eldest	I will do what I can to stabilize him, but I will need your help. The small amount of energy he has left is coming from the mana pool he rests in. Follow the whelplings' lead. Dropping ley crystals into the pool gives him a bit of energy - buying him a few more breaths. They seem to be getting the crystals from inside that cave to the north. 
Stop the attacks from the Obsidian, Ruby, Azure, and Emerald Dragonshrines in one attempt of the Deaths of Chromie scenario.	Preserve the True Future	I know how this looks, George. I'm not asking for your help simply because I don't want to get killed. I need your help because this isn't how I'm SUPPOSED to die. I will die - I've seen it! - but it happens much later than this. Besides, meddling with the timeways for personal reasons - well, it goes against pretty much everything my dragonflight stands for. Let's stop all four of the dragonshrine attacks. That should do the trick. 
Speak to Mayor Heathrow at Bradensbrook.	A Village in Peril	Another outsider? Some bloke named Jarod just went off to our village down the road claiming he might be able to help us with our problem. If you're here to help as well, then you best speak to the Mayor. Just know this is a bad time, and he's got an itchy trigger finger. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	Feeding the Rebellion	More nightborne flee Suramar every day to join our cause. Our ranks are swelling, and with the aid of great heroes like yourself and the armies of the Horde and Alliance, our chances have never been better. Help me hand out more fruit of the arcan'dor - each one is a life free from slavish dependence on the Nightwell! Afterwards, we shall speak on how best to assist our new allies in their siege. 
Help Addie learn to hunt by killing wildlife in Pinerock Basin.	A Hunter at Heart	Addie's one heck of a writer, but I've never seen her hold a rifle. She's keen on learning how to hunt, but who's ever heard of a gnome hunter? You seem to have a knack dealin' with amateurs, so maybe you'd be willin' to let the gnome tag along on a hunt? She could learn a thing or two by shadowing someone with your skill. Ya best start off with some small game. We don't want the lass to get discouraged. 
Meet with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection: An Elven Problem	The Alliance and Horde have arrived in Suramar. First Arcanist Thalyssra needs your help in providing an introduction. Meet with Thalyssra in Shal'Aran. 
Speak with Alleria at Light's Purchase.	Reinforce Light's Purchase	Now that we have established a foothold, we need to rendezvous with our soldiers in the field. We have an Army of the Light encampment to the south, near where the Legion is keeping their strongest warriors in some sort of stasis. Alleria went to scout the area. Find her, and see what information she has gathered. 
Complete the first of Ursol's trials.	The First Trial of Ursol	The Legion...<the glow of Ursol's eyes begin to shine intensely>Yes... I remember clearly that day long ago when my brother fell. Countless demons fell beneath his claws until, through the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, he was overtaken. My brother was the true spirit of the bear! You must prove to me that the spirit of the bear resides within you as well. 
Kill Calder and Eynar in Jandvik.	Removing Obstacles	Mechanic! Interested in earning some coin? The jarl of Jandvik is missing and two headstrong whelps are vying to take over leadership. I should be the next jarl, not them! I want you to enter Jandvik and defeat Calder and Eynar in mortal combat. I would not normally put my trust in an outsider, but this situation requires the aid of someone like you. Jandvik would condemn me if I were caught with their blood on my hands. Meet me in the center of Jandvik when the deed is done. 
Speak with Vanthir in The Grand Promenade.	First Contact	Time to put your new disguise to the test. Your first contact is Vanthir, a merchant from the common district. He is in the Grand Promenade today visiting one of his suppliers. Tell Vanthir to pay me a visit regarding a shipment of dusk lily bulbs. He will understand. Beyond that, we will need time to prepare. You should return to Thalyssra.<Ly'leth hands you a corked bottle of faintly glowing fluid.>Give her this, with my regards. We will call upon you soon. 
Defeat Nexus-Prince Bilaal and claim Aluneth, Greatstaff of the Magna.	The Nexus Vault	If the Ethereum managed to capture Azuregos, then they are more powerful than I imagined. We have not always seen eye to eye, Azuregos and I, but he is still my kin. Since you seek to put an end to the ethereals and claim Aluneth, I ask that you also free my brother from their grip. With the Surge Needles destroyed, the shield has dissipated. The Nexus awaits, George. 
Acquire 3 Stacks of Letters from Nightborne Couriers using the Nightborne Spellblade.	Special Delivery	Verene's child has gone missing. I can guess what happened, but I need to be sure. Most guardsmen use couriers to relay delicate information. In this, magic is strictly the province of high ranking officials. Take this blade. Do not touch the cutting edge. Use it to silently waylay the couriers and collect any correspondence they carry. With any luck, the missives will tell us exactly where to find the girl. We guards know everything, after all.<Silgryn offers you a winning smile.> 
	Claws for Alarm!	 
Speak with Chromie, then travel to the future to find out how she dies.	The Day That Chromie Dies	Oh, George! I was just thinking about you! Talk about being at the right time in the right place! I was just reviewing some aberrations in the timeways, when I discovered something... unexpected. Something not-so-great. I'm going to die in the near future. Bad times. I was just about to jump ahead and see if I can figure out why, how, who... but I'd feel better with |5Human like you by my side. Care to join me? 
Join the other paladins at Light's Hope Sanctum beneath Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.	We Meet at Light's Hope	We must put Highlord Tirion to rest. There is but one place suitable for a paladin of his caliber... Light's Hope Sanctum, a secret bastion of the Light hidden beneath our chapel. Paladins the world over will join us for the ceremony. I know Tirion would want you there most of all. 
Collect the antlers of the cursed ancient spirit, Morashu.	Moose on the Loose	There's been chatter around the hunters' lodge about a crazed moose that is terrorizing the basin. I've never laid eyes on the beast myself, but they say its antlers are illuminated with magic. Where other lesser hunters have tried and failed, you will prevail, and collect me a one-of-a-kind trophy! 
Speak with 8 Masqued Revelers while in costume, then speak with Ly'leth Lunastre.	The Masks We Wear	Many nightborne had pinned their hopes on Thalyssra deposing the Grand Magistrix. Since she disappeared, dissenting voices have grown silent. We must spread the word, discreetly, among the populace. Ly'leth Lunastre will be a perfect ally in this. She is a socialite with many connections, and she is no friend of the Legion. Ly'leth hosts a masquerade party at her estate where rumors are traded like coin - and brandished like daggers. Let us invite ourselves in. 
	Pocket Wizard	 
Aid the shaman of the Earthen Ring at the Maelstrom. Stormcaller Mylra will fly you there from Krasus' Landing in Dalaran.	A Ring Unbroken	Our defeat at the Broken Shore was decisive. The Burning Legion has a foothold on Azeroth, and the best of our armies are retreating in tatters. The elders of the Earthen Ring have called an emergency council near the heart of our world - the Maelstrom. George, your triumphs throughout Azeroth and Draenor are the stuff of legend. We need you more than ever. Join me at the Maelstrom. Stormcaller Mylra will be flying there shortly - find her at Krasus' Landing here in Dalaran. 
Board the Vindicaar.	The Vindicaar	Everything is prepared for our assault. We need only establish the beacon to transport us to the vessel. Once the beacon arrives, place your hand upon its surface to board the Vindicaar, the instrument of our retribution. 
Construct a Makeshift Ballista and kill Tidemistress Sashj'tar in the Sashj'tar Ruins.	Turning the Tidemistress	The Tidemistress has fallen back to the elven ruins and is licking her wounds. Her guard is undoubtedly protecting her. To best her, you will have to break her defenses. Construct a ballista using the parts that you salvaged and end her once and for all. 
Recover a Containment Crystal from the Vault of the Wardens on Mythic difficulty.	Vault of the Wardens: Borrowing Without Asking	The elusive Wardens run an immense secret prison facility deep underneath the mountains of Azsuna housing all manner of terrible creatures. Perhaps... 'used to run' is more accurate. This presents us with a unique opportunity. The wardens used powerful containment crystals to encase each prisoner in their cell. If any of them still remain intact, we could use one to safely contain the Heart's power. They certainly won't be needing them. 
Speak with Thalyssra when you are ready to lead the withered in their first combat training mission.	Building an Army	We must keep our eyes on the future. There will come a time when we will need an army. We've proven that the withered are not completely beyond redemption. They can be taught, and molded. I want you to be their combat trainer, George. Come with me. We can use the nearby ruins as an arena to hone their abilities. 
Absorb Hati's essence into the Thunderspark at the Temple of Storms.	The Huntsman's Creed	Through the glorious wonder of science, I have managed to keep the Thunderspark powered precisely for this purpose. All you need to do is get to the Temple of Storms and absorb Hati's essence into it. Just... kind of point it in his general direction. Oh, and do keep in mind that this is only one part of Hati. You may run into a few... technical difficulties before he's subdued enough for the absorption protocol. 
Make contact with the Gondolier.	The Gondolier	I need your help. The wine you so graciously distributed to the needy was the last of my reserves. Without more, these people here will risk succumbing to their thirst, and eventually becoming withered. I am dedicated to preventing this for as long as possible. There is a woman by the name of Deline who owns and operates a small delivery service out of her gondola. Find her, identify yourself as my messenger, and offer your aid in acquiring the next shipment. 
Defeat Helya in the Trials of Valor raid and then use the Soul Prism of the Illidari to claim Illidan's Soul.	Trial of Valor: The Once and Future Lord of Shadows	While tracking the master's physical body proved challenging, we were able to locate it in the Nighthold of Suramar. Our intelligence reports that Gul'dan is making final preparations to the Nightwell in order to use its power to usher the soul of Sargeras into Illidan's body. The only way to stop that from happening is to put Illidan's own immortal soul back. Take the Soul Prism of the Illidari and venture to Helheim. Defeat Helya and use the prism on Illidan's soul! Return it to Light's Heart. 
Activate the Mysterious Cube	Cubic Coalescing	Success! The cube's magic has been restored! I'm excited to see what it does! Since you did all the legwork, you should have the honor of activating it. Care to give it a try? 
Absorb the combined power of the Corrupted Essences using the Heart of Zin-Azshari.	Essential Consumption	As before, George, once you are ready raise your artifact and channel its energy upon the Heart of Zin-Azshari and we will unleash the power of the essence you gathered. Do not worry - we still have enough of the blood you gathered to ensure the ritual remains stable. 
	All Howl, No Bite	 
	Safe Keeping	 
	Work Order: Cursed Queenfish	 
Repel the Burning Legion forces throughout Azsuna.	Assault on Azsuna	The demons strike at the heart of our existence, posing a threat to all who inhabit our lands. Remove the threat before it is too late. 
Speak to Lady Liadrin to set sail for the Exodar.	Two If By Sea	The draenei have crafted a vessel to take us to Argus safely. They are gathering the invasion force on Azuremyst Isle as we speak. We will join them there by sea. The Legion is no doubt keeping a close eye on the gateway to their world. We must retain the element of surprise. Let me know when you are ready. 
Meet Ly'leth Lunastre at the Waning Crescent.	The Perfect Opportunity	I have heard whispers from Suramar City. Recent unrest in the city has prompted the nobles to seek another advisor to fill Elisande's council. Such positions are rarely offered and hotly contested. This is the perfect opportunity and Ly'leth is the perfect candidate. Fate smiles upon our cause! I know she has historically chosen to avoid such politics and maneuvering, but we must now ask her to join the fray. Seek her out at the Waning Crescent and ensure her victory. 
Use the Signal Crystal to call down a Lightforged Beacon from the Vindicaar.	Rendezvous	There is much to be done before this nightmare can end, but we need to regroup before we draw more attention from the Legion. I managed to retain a signal crystal during the crash used to call transport beacons from the Xenedar. With luck, we should be able to use it to establish a link between here and your forces as well. 
Enter the Emerald Dream and obtain the Claws of Ursoc.	When Dreams Become Nightmares	Now that we have Ursol's blessing, we can safely pass the magical wards and reach the claws' resting place! Now, we must pass into the Dream. Lay down before the Shrine of Ursol and drink of the moonwater you brought earlier and your spirit will drift off into the dream. Be careful, the Dream can be a dangerous place. 
Complete the ""All In"" scenario. Chief Telemancer Oculeth can begin the scenario.	All In	It is time to put our plan into action. Oculeth will send you, Arluin and myself into the Arcway, where we shall trigger a manastorm in the Nightflow Conduit. Valtrois will stay here and prepare Shal'Aran for a massive jolt of arcane power - hopefully enough to satisfy the arcan'dor.$p... We have a saying... ""To lead is to stand alone."" It means only those who bear the weight of leadership can truly appreciate it. Thank you for standing beside me. In truth, I do not feel alone. 
	The Wine's Gone Bad	 
Complete 3 Invasion Points.	Invasion Point Offensive	The invasion points are key to cutting off Legion reinforcements to Argus. Defeating their armies within the lesser portals will allow us to assault larger invasion points and extinguish the Legion presence within. 
	Death Metal Knight	 
Speak with Illidan at the Veiled Den.	Reinforce the Veiled Den	The foothold you established allows us to check in with our field operatives. On our last mission here, we set up a bastion to the northeast. It should be defensible for now, but that could change at any moment. Illidan has gone ahead to assess the situation. I suggest you go there and see if he needs a hand. 
Infuse the leyline feed with Ancient Mana.	Leyline Feed: Falanaar Arcway	<The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.> 
Reach Honored with The Nightfallen.	Seed of Hope	Thalyssra was wise to send you in search of the arcan'dor, though she underestimates its power. She will learn - as will the others. But it will take time. And with hunger gnawing at their very souls, the Nightfallen will need your help to survive. 
Kill 12 gilblin and/or makrura at Mak'rana and slay their leader, Queen Kraklaa.	Making the World Safe for Profit	Might I ask a small favor, my friend? These creatures in the tide pools to the east are starting to frighten me. Our efforts to trade with them have been rebuffed at every turn with aggression. This is not good; neither for running a business, nor for profit. Sadly, I must admit the time for talk has come to an end. Might you be willing to serve as my representative in dealing with the denizens of Mak'rura and their ""queen""?I can assure you that your efforts will be rewarded commensurately. 
Defeat Torok Bloodtotem at Torok's Bluff.	Blood Debt	You have proven a much greater ally than the Bloodtotem ever were. With my focus crystal, my wounds are healed. I fear Frag was too far gone to revive. Torok and his Bloodtotem will suffer for what they have done to us. Let's pay them a visit before they can mount an attack against the cave of my people. 
Explore Anora Hollow and find the Ley Station there.	Tapping the Leylines	The arcways were built to tap into the magical leylines beneath Suramar. As we learned to subsist on the Nightwell, the old facilities fell out of use. This chamber is clearly receiving power from elsewhere. There is only a trickle now, but if you can direct more leyline energy here it will help to sustain us. The closest source is to the north, near Anora Hollow. 
Enter the Tomb of Sargeras and defeat Kil'jaeden.	The Deceiver's Downfall	Once he was as a brother to me. Then he bartered the soul of my world for his own power. Hounded my people across the stars. Twisted my son into a monster. Now he has come to oversee the final assault on Azeroth. To end this world as he has countless others. Kil'jaeden. We must ensure he does not escape our grasp this time, George. Storm the tomb. Break the Legion's hold. End the Deceiver's reign. 
	Scourge of the Skies	 
Meet Turalyon at the Conservatory of the Arcane.	We Have a Problem	We have a problem, George. The Legion has come to Eredath. When you claimed the Sigil it was as if we announced our presence to all of Argus. The eyes of Antorus are firmly upon us. Just wait. It gets worse. Velen took Captain Fareeya and her forces into the Arinor Gardens area to search for the Crest of Knowledge. To my knowledge, they are all now behind enemy lines. Come with me to the Conservatory. We need to bring Velen and the others back before it is too late. 
Defend the Temple of Elune.	The Fate of Val'sharah	Malfurion, my love.... My heart breaks for him, but I cannot follow where he goes. I have sworn myself to Elune, my goddess, to defend her temples and lands with all that I am. I cannot stand by while my order is in danger. May she keep you in her graces, Malfurion.<Tyrande turns away, eyes glistening with tears.> 
Repel the Burning Legion forces throughout Stormheim.	Assault on Stormheim	The eternal foe of our world, the Burning Legion, dare to attack the land of Stormheim! Champion, now is your call to valor! Find the forces of the Legion and eradicate them! 
Absorb the power from the Corrupted Essence using the Heart of Zin-Azshari.	Lucid Strength	We have everything we need, George. Once you are ready, raise your artifact and channel its energy upon the Heart of Zin-Azshari to safely absorb the power stored within the nightmare essence. I will use the blood you provided to make sure the ritual stays safely contained. 
	Operation Murloc Freedom	 
Complete 3 standard Invasion Points.	Invasion Onslaught	We must not yield even a single world to the Legion. Continue our Invasion Point offensive and crush the Legion beneath your heel. 
Infuse the leyline feed with Ancient Mana.	Leyline Feed: Elor'shan	<The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.> 
Defeat Lord Commander Alexius in Stormheim.	Battle for Stormheim	Your efforts have destroyed the Legion's forces upon Shield's Rest, yet they continue to press their assault. There is only one way to end this - you must venture into the midst of our foe, find their commander, and remove his vile head! 
Inform Thaon Moonclaw of the return of Xavius.	The Nightmare Lord	You arrived just in time, friend. Kagraxxis was moments away from sacrificing me to his master... I was certain I would perish. I am grateful, but we are not out of danger yet... Xavius has returned. The Nightmare Lord is here in Val'sharah, personally orchestrating the corruption of this land. My captor revealed as much to me before I was to be sacrificed. We must find Thaon Moonclaw and inform him before it is too late! 
Collect 4 Warp-Resistant Plating from Chronarch Defenders.	Ephemeral Manastorm Projector	Oculeth's theory is sound. Reckless, but sound. A small warp-field could trap and excite ambient mana in the conduit, thus creating a manastorm similar to when the arcan'dor fell out of balance. I can build a device to generate the warp-field, but I need materials. Specifically, warp-resistant alloys - such as the armor plating of high-end security constructs in the noble district. Those constructs are deadly. If anyone owes you a favor, now is the time to call it in. 
Find Strom'kar, the Warbreaker and deal with Zakajz.	The Sword of Kings	The first king of the humans, Thoradin, performed many acts of heroism and valor. While on a personal quest near the end of his reign, he stumbled upon the tomb of my brother Tyr... and the grave-prison of the monstrosity he died fighting. Thoradin unintentionally awoke the beast and gave his life to keep it from escaping. It is Thoradin's sword, Strom'kar, that has kept the monster at bay. Retrieve it and finish what Tyr and Thoradin started. Kill Zakajz the Corrupted. 
Meet with Ritssyn Flamescowl in the Circle of Wills beneath Dalaran.	The Sixth	Greetings, warlock. I speak on behalf of the Council of the Black Harvest. With the Legion invasion upon us, it is painfully clear that our only hope is to grow stronger. The council plans to tap into the Twisting Nether and call forth more powerful demon allies. The ritual is ready, but we are short one number. No doubt you have heard of the fate that befell Kanrethad Ebonlocke. You will be his replacement. Do you accept? 
Speak to Chief Telemancer Oculeth.	Silence in the City	There is a troubling silence from Suramar City this day. Oculeth just informed me that the teleporter to the Waning Crescent has gone dark. He is not able to reach Vanthir, nor am I. While I am hesitant to believe something dire has happened, I do feel this warrants investigation. Speak with Oculeth and see if he can transport you to the Waning Crescent. We need to find out what happened. 
Bring Jale Rivermane to Thunder Totem.	Get to High Ground	It is no accident that Dargrul attacked the Rivermane in force. It is their farms and their pastures that supply food for the region. Please, get Jale to Thunder Totem. With luck, Mayla will have reinforcements to send to the area. We will rally the survivors here and follow as quickly as we can. 
Bring the Broken Sentinax Beacon to Warmage Kath'leen in Deliverance Point.	The Shadow of the Sentinax	This device appears to be used to relay messages to the large demon ship up above. Unfortunately, it is cracked and unresponsive. Perhaps someone at Deliverance Point will know more about these beacons. 
	Flummoxed	 
Use the central teleporter in Dalaran and then place the Tidestone of Golganneth in the Portrait Room of the Chamber of the Guardian.	Eye of Azshara: The Tidestone of Golganneth	<Now that you have defeated Queen Azshara's Wrath and have the Tidestone in hand, it is time to place it in the Portrait Room of the Chamber of the Guardian in lower Dalaran.> 
Trace an arcane rune, a fire rune, and a frost rune.	Pop Quiz: Advanced Rune Drawing	Still aching to get into the headmistress' study, eh? I suppose I can let you in... as long as you prove that you've been studying. Proper rune formation is essential when it comes to spellcasting. If you can draw a rune, you can cast a spell. I will provide outlines for you. You can simply use your feet to trace the runes. 
Speak with the lead demon hunter at Illidari Stand.	Into the Fray	The Burning Legion has beaten us here, but so too have the Illidari. It looks like the demon hunters are holding their own, but just barely. Come, let's put that weapon of yours to use. I'll figure out our next move while you crush the Legion. 
Defeat God-King Skovald in the Gates of Valor.	Stormheim's Salvation	It would seem that the portals we destroyed down here were not the only ones. Demons still pour in from the top of the Gates of Valor's edifice, summoned by the God-King himself! I cannot face Skovald alone. Come, champion, let us take the battle to him and end this threat! For Stormheim! 
Investigate the Ruins of Oronaar.	Whispers from Oronaar	Ethereals, the Void, a Dark Naaru... I feel they are all connected. I explored the ruins below while you and Velen were seeking the Crown. There are survivors, George. Broken wander the cluster of buildings to our west- I cannot understand much of what they say but I suspect that their minds are not their own. If the Void is to blame, we will need to start our investigation there. I will conduct my own search in the meantime. 
Retrieve the Svalnguard and defeat Helya in the Maw of Souls on Mythic difficulty.	Maw of Souls: Retrieving the Svalnguard	The Svalnguard was once Odyn's shield; it is said that it hid the Halls of Valor from the endless darkness below his realm. Helya, who was cast from the shining halls long ago, stole The Svalnguard and keeps it on her accursed ship, the Naglfar. You must board the Naglfar, defeat Helya, and retrieve The Svalnguard - it will make a worthy tribute for Odyn. 
Hear out the Council of Six in the Purple Parlor.	In Dire Need	The ill tidings you bear only increase the concerns the Council has been having. I know you have your hands full with the Tomb of Sargeras. Make no mistake, the battle for the tomb remains our top priority--but we must not think the Legion foolish enough to rely on brute force alone. They are far more cunning than that. Please, hear us out. 
Look for the rumored treasure on the Felrage Strand.	We're Treasure Hunters	I have a feeling you're just using me for tips on where all the best treasure is. From now on I'm naga tell you anything. Did I say, ""naga"" just then? I meant to say, I'm not gonna to tell you naga. I mean nada! Darn it! Okay. Seems you got me on this one. I'll tell you what, fetch me whatever is in that chest near those naga freaks and I'll make it worth your while. 
	Now That's Just Clawful!	 
Activate 4 Arcane Wards in Ambervale.	A Re-Warding Effort	<This small device of elegant nightborne design crackles gently with arcane power. Kel'danath's notes mention wards that keep the withered at bay. It seems he found some form of spellcasting that does not tempt their ravenous appetite for magic. These may prove useful in your search for the missing arcanist.> 
Help Garona take out the Veiled Hand cultists in Stormwind.	The Unseen Blade	Stormwind is too important to fall to the Legion, and I don't trust Shaw or his SI:7 goons to take care of the Hand on their own. The two of us will have to handle this while there's still time. Use extreme caution. The entire city is on edge from murmurs of the cult's activities, and we're already kill on sight. The other Shadows spoke highly of your skills. Are you in? 
Investigate the events of the Waning Crescent.	Crackdown	Thalyssra is right to be concerned! The network has not responded to my attempts to re-establish connection with the Waning Crescent. I do not know what happened, but given the circumstances I believe it prudent to investigate in person. George, would you do the honors? I will send you as close to the Waning Crescent as I can. 
Await the opening of the Emerald Nightmare, then report back to Senegos in Azsuna.	The Wisdom of Patience	The horrors you braved in the thicket are only the beginning. Within the Emerald Nightmare you will face the very heart of the corruption that threatens the stability of all life on Azeroth. But not just yet. We have not yet managed to permeate the magic protecting Xavius' sinister realm. Once we have, however, you should return here; there is still much to be done. 
Use the central teleporter in Dalaran and then place the Hammer of Khaz'goroth in Aegwynn's Gallery.	The Hammer of Khaz'goroth	<Now that you have defeated Dargrul the Underking and have the Hammer of Khaz'goroth in hand, it is time to place it in Aegwynn's Gallery in the lower chambers of Dalaran.> 
Escape the Vault.	The Backdoor	This will take Mayla some time to adjust to. That being said, we should return to Thunder Totem. Just south of here is a tunnel that should take us through the old drogbar slave enclave and then to an opening beyond. We keep a small Skyhorn outpost there to watch and ensure nothing enters or leaves this vault without us knowing about it. They should be able to fly us back. 
	Illidari Masters: Madam Viciosa	 
Collect 8 Cliffthorn.	The Lost Advisor	You may as well assist me while you are here. I require a potion to be made, one that will set things right. I must conserve my energy until my task is finished, lest I become like these miserable wretches scrabbling at the cobblestones. There is coin in it for you, since I will not be needing it soon. The harpies around here cannot resist cliffthorn. It is what drew them to Tel'anor in the first place. You should find plenty just outside this building. 
Overcharge 3 Imperial Conjurers using the Inert Crystal. You must be standing on a Mana Focuser to use the crystal.	Overwhelming Distraction	Do you see the Nightborne outside this room? They hold us here, like mice in a cage. It is more convenient for them that we are pinned down while they search the Sanctum for my father's relics. My companions and I can escape to higher ground with some help. Take this crystal. While standing on a mana focusing rune, use it to overcharge a Conjurer. Their summons will turn on them and create an opening. Use it well, and we will meet you atop the stronghold when the way is clear. 
Meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.	Preparing to Move	Thanks to your tireless efforts the Heart of Zin-Azshari is ready to withstand the full power of the Legion. The final destination in our journey has stood defiantly in front of us from the moment we began - the Nighthold, now home to none other than Gul'dan himself. Before we move on the hold, we should reunite with the Moon Guard in Shal'Aran - we still have need of their skills, and I would wager that they have unfinished business with their former brothers and sisters. 
Defeat the Dark Riders in the Karazhan Catacombs and claim Ulthalesh.	The Dark Riders	There's a sewer grate along the edge of the river leading to catacombs underneath Karazhan. I've never paid it much attention, but it could be where the spirits are directing us. To think, the Dark Riders may have been under our noses this entire time! Come, let us see where this leads. 
	Forming a Bond	 
Defeat Fel Commander Erixtol in Highmountain.	Battle for Highmountain	Our defenses have grown in strength, yet the Legion continues to press their assault on Thunder Totem. There is but one way to put an end to this madness - we must strike at the heart of their forces together and bring these attacks to an end. 
Meet Prophet Velen in the Vault of Lights in the Exodar.	Light's Exodus	Prophet Velen and the others have gathered within the Vault of Lights below. There is an entrance just down this path. We should find the Prophet at once so that we do not stall the invasion. 
Break the Seal of the Tides, Seal of the Earth and Seal of the Sky.	Breaking the Seal	<As you behold the relic, Thalyssra's voice echoes in your mind.>You found it! But it is sealed away tight. Search the room for a way to break those seals. 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Assault on Felfire Armory.""	Felfire Shattering	A thin series of stone bridges connects the Burning Breach to Felfire Armory over Fiend's Run. The Army of the Light will stem Legion reinforcements while your people deal with the armory itself. Work swiftly. 
Kill 12 Nath'raxxan Fleshcarvers, Nath'raxxan Doomshots, or Ravenous Soulhunters, and 1 Nathrezim Banelord.	Chaos Theory	Despite their strength and their numbers, even the Burning Legion requires order to fight. Disrupt that order... and they fall like the rabble they are. The plan is simple. Let chaos reign in their ranks, and the day will be ours. 
Meet with Vanthir in Suramar City.	One of the People	It is time for you to enter the city proper, George. I am sending you to my loyal friend Vanthir. I do hope you remember him- I can guarantee that he remembers you. I will not be able to accompany you, but I must stress that the disguise I have granted you is not impervious. Tread carefully, and avoid those who stare too long. Farewell for now. 
Locate and recover ""Anthology of the Guard"", ""Magical Manifest of the Moon"", and ""Aftermath of the Well"".	Precious Little Left	I have not been able to leave the safety of my guardians to search, but there are three tomes of great importance to me and mine. They contain secrets and cantrips that the Nightborne must NOT obtain. <Lothrius raises his hand to your forehead, cementing the names of three tomes into your mind> If we cannot best them, we must preserve all we can. Hurry, George. 
Deliver Theryn to Thalyssra.	Subject 16	<It seems Theryn is still under the arcanist's spell. In the absence of Kel'danath himself, a live subject could be useful in helping Thalyssra unravel his research.> 
Look for the rumored treasure outside the Tomb of Sargeras.	Tomb Raidering	I said to myself over and over, ""Don't go near the citadel. Don't go near the citadel."" But what did I do? I went to the citadel. Almost had my hands on that sweet treasure chest before I got chased off by a bunch of crazy demons. I made it out of there with just my helmet and my life! 
Bribe Arluin with 800 Ancient Mana.	If Words Don't Work...	Unless you have something worth risking my life for, I will not budge. Vanthir must have told you that my services do not come cheap. Let's say... enough mana to sustain me for a month.<Arluin looks smug, as if you could never agree to this request.> 
Collect 4 Axetail Eyes from Axetail Basilisks, a Sashj'tar Air Bladder from Sashj'tar Naga, and a Sample of Siren Blood from Siren Naz'jul in Azuregale Cove.	Fisherman's Tonic	If you detest these serpents as much as we do, I ask that you continue the fight against them. That will mean fighting them in their watery domain. I don't see any gills on you, so we're going to have to concoct an old tonic used by vrykul fishermen. The ingredients are plentiful around here, taken that you do not mind picking through entrails. 
I should be able to create an item that allows you to change the appearance of Hati, but the components for such an item are rare. The Squallhunters from Stormheim have a Stormy Gland, and the Stoneblood Harpies near Thas'talah in Val'sharah have Pristine Harpy Feathers that I need. The Hatecoil Naga near the Ruins of Nar'thalas in Azsuna are said to have Reflective Scales, and finally I need an Essence of Pure Spirit from the Seabound Mystics in the Blind Marshlands of Highmountain.	A New Invention	I have been experimenting with technology that allows you to alter the structure of beasts, specifically with how they look. 
Kill Desdel Stareye.	Lieutenant of the Tower	All of your instincts were correct. Gul'dan raised Lord Ravencrest, and his ghostly army, from beyond the grave. Now, they serve the Legion, protecting secrets within the tower. Although Ravencrest commands from above, Lieutenant Desdel Stareye operates the prisons. He tormented me these past few moons, but I did not yield.<Maiev runs a finger along her curved blade.>His life must be ended. 
	Darkbrul Arena	 
Acquire flank meat from Thunderhoof in Stormheim, Spinesever's spine in Highmountain, and a steak from Leytusk in Azsuna.	A Feast Fit for Odyn	It is customary in the Halls of Valor to feast after battle is finished. Presenting a truly glorious feast to Odyn from beasts worthy of his throne will show him your determination to earn his blessing. Acquire flank meat from Thunderhoof in Stormheim, Spinesever's spine in Highmountain, and the finest cut of steak from Leytusk in Azsuna. They will make a feast worthy of the great battle to come. 
Evacuate survivors in the Waning Crescent and Siren's Vigil.	No Reason to Stay	Elisande's purge of the Waning Crescent came so swiftly that few could react. Many of my people are dead or taken. Some may have endured this atrocity. We need to make sure they are not left behind. I need you to search the houses nearby for any survivors. See that they flee before they are discovered. Reassure them that there is no reason to stay. Not here, not while Elisande's insanity reigns. 
Defeat Anarys Lunastre and deliver <him/her> to Ly'leth Lunastre.	Blood of My Blood	As my darling <brother/sister> has demonstrated, Elisande's decision to bring down the shield has sown unrest among the nightborne. Loyalists and demons march together in the streets. Fear and distrust grip our hearts. Family turns against family. I will help Thalyssra stir a new rebellion, but first we must deal with Anarys. I do not wish to spill the blood of my blood - only to help <him/her> see reason. Anarys is likely brooding over our father's memorial. Bring <him/her> to me alive. 
Accompany Archdruid Greathoof and then speak with Malfurion Stormrage.	Ascending The Circle	Now, you are more powerful than ever! Truly, you are a druid without equal, George. I sense that Malfurion has arrived. He will certainly want to know of your accomplishments, but first, please walk with me a moment. 
Search within Dalaran for Grave Dust, a Can of Overheated Oil, an Aged Snowplum Brandy, and a Stag Blood Sample.	Ritual Reagents	The Skull of the Man'ari, oh good choice! It's very powerful and it's held by an even more powerful Dreadlord! There is a weakness, the skull has a will of its own! If we can commune with the skull we might be able to convince it to serve you instead! We will need reagents from the floating city before we can perform the ritual to commune with it. Dust from a fresh grave, dark oil, and a powerful alcohol catalyst. Oh, and blood! I sense a beast whose blood should be perfect. 
Look for the rumored treasure deep in the Forlorn Depths.	Ship Graveyard	I haven't told you that I was part of the original landing party when we lost almost everything. I don't care what treasure is left there, I'll never go back to that beach. Never. 
Use your Death Gate ability to travel to Icecrown and obtain the Blades of the Fallen Prince.	The Call of Icecrown	<A powerful presence again touches your thoughts.>I have ordered your brethren to Icecrown to prepare for the coming conflict, but I have a more important fate in mind for you. You, George, will be the hand of our vengeance! Use the Death Gate to return to Acherus and I shall reveal your role in this. 
Absorb Hati's essence into the Thunderspark at the Wound in Silithus.	Paid in Blood	If Mimiron's fancy gadgets be right, then the other half o' Hati is near the wound in Silithus. We'll have tae move quickly. Even with part o' his essence contained, I can feel him fadin' away fast!'Tis a long trip, <lad/lass>. Let's get movin'! 
Complete the ""Nightfall"" storyline in Suramar, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.	Seeking Refuge	The Nightfallen in Suramar were once a part of the Nightborne, but have been exiled by their former brethren and cut off from the Nightwell. I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if you can turn them to our side. I know only that they have gone into hiding somewhere in Suramar. If you can convince the Nightfallen to aid us, they may be able to offer the Moon Guard and us both refuge right under the Legion's nose. 
Raise 6 Champions to 900 Item Level.	Nath'raxas Hold: Preparations	One of two fates await krokul prisoners taken to Nath'raxas Hold. Consume the fel, and become a willing soldier in the infinite army, or be mutated into a disfigured abomination. An ur'zul. While the Army of the Light occupies the Legion's attention, I am presented with an opportunity to save my people. I ask for your aid. Before we begin, your forces must be adequately equipped. 
Search the Azure Dragonshrine for clues regarding the current state of the Nexus.	A New Threat	If you seek the Nexus, I would warn not to rush headlong. There are strange happenings in Coldarra, and it would be best to gather some information before proceeding. During my last visit to the Dragonblight, I sensed unusual energies from the Azure Dragonshrine. Since this place was very closely tied to Malygos' plans during the Nexus Wars, whatever is present there may explain the current state of the Nexus. I cannot accompany you, but this crystal can be used to communicate with me. Good luck. 
Investigate Elisande's time spell with Khadgar.	Temporal Investigations	I knew the shal'dorei dabbled in time magic, but this is simply incredible...Elisande stopped time on our entire army! Come, let us investigate. Perhaps there is a way to break the spell - or at least discover how it is being maintained. 
Defeat Bredda Tenderhide in a pet battle.	Training with Bredda	 
Obtain the Charged Arcshaper Staff and a Volatile Construct Core for Sendath.	Nullified	The magus in charge of the defenses here is powerful. Perhaps too strong, even for the both of us. Fortunately, the sin'dorei know a thing or two about magic. The mage's barrier is strong, but we are clever. He has somehow channeled enough energy into his staff to power another set of defense portals, but he has left it out of his sight. Bring me the staff and an energy source from one of those constructs. I should be able to create just the thing we need to take that shield out. 
Speak with Turalyon to revive Xe'ra.	The Child of Light and Shadow	It is time, George. Xe'ra is returned to us. We have Light's Heart. We have her Chosen One. Come, let us restore her. Let us forge a bright new path against our foes. Speak to me when you are ready to begin. 
Search the Shipwreck Debris in Helmouth Shallows for Havi's clue.	Scavenging the Shallows	The kvaldir exist to spite Odyn, and it is here their spiteful work is done. They rob the souls of the living - the souls not yet judged - thus robbing Odyn of his champions. They bring them here to transport to Helya, though the mists obscure any indications of how. You seem to fare the mists well. Perhaps if you search the wreckage in the bay, the answer may present itself. You outsiders seem to have a knack for uncovering the most hidden of secrets. 
Free Aleifir, Hrafsir, Erilar and Hridmogir in Thorim's Peak.	Wings of Liberty	When the Felskorn assaulted the nest, the Thorignir fought bravely to save our brood. But their demonic allies proved too much, and many of us were captured. Even now they work to corrupt my brothers and sisters to turn them to their side. Please, outsider, free them from this fate! 
Select your next assault point on the Broken Isles at the Command Map in your Order Hall.	Pressing the Assault	<With this Pillar of Creation safely secured, it is time to take advantage of your momentum and continue onward after the next.><You recall that your order has gathered information that would aid you in your journey - looking it over once more before setting off would be wise.> 
Confront Dargrul the Underking.	Dargrul and the Hammer	We are about to follow a drogbar into a cave, something we warn our children never to do. Even so, several of our warbraves have already followed Dargrul inside. Come, join us in battle and let us reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. 
	Feltotem's Fall	Our Highmountain contact, Navarrogg, reports that Tugar Bloodtotem has finally resurfaced. He's sent a message crystal along with some instructions for me. I can teleport you to Navarrogg and he will take you to Tugar's location, but there is one problem. Navarrogg requires additional magical power to fend off Tugar's fel magicks. You will need some Nethershards before you go. 
Seek the aid of the Knights of the Ebon Blade in Acherus above the Broken Isles.	Walking in Shadows	If we are to infuse the shard's power into the Ashbringer we will need help. We cannot wield such dark magic; however, I know who can...The Knights of the Ebon Blade. I will commission a flight for you to Acherus at once and meet you there - find Aludane Whitecloud in Dalaran when you are ready. 
Take the Mysterious Cube to Dariness the Learned in Dalaran.	Cubic Conundrum	<You find a mysterious cube. Its design is unfamiliar, but unmistakably ancient. The cube's surface is inlaid with magical runes. Though inert, its properties may be worth investigating. Perhaps if you show it to Dariness the Learned in Dalaran, she could tell you more about it.> 
Collect a hunting trophy from the lion that Ellias claims to have seen in Pinerock Basin.	I'm Not Lion!	I've hunted many exotic beasts in my day, but I've never seen a lion like the one I encountered while scouting the basin. The beast's amber eyes locked on mine, luring me closer. I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break. I've told Hemet of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, George! The lion exists. If you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	A Message From Ly'leth	The arcan'dor bears fruit once again. Just in time, too - Ly'leth has sent us a message, and it seems she may have a lead on Vanthir. He is long overdue for this gift, assuming we manage to find him. Give a fruit to another citizen here in Shal'Aran while I finish decrypting Ly'leth's message. 
Investigate the Umbra Hollows with Alleria and Locus-Walker.	Throwing Shade	That was Locus-Walker. He taught me all that I know about the Void, and he still has more to teach me. If he is here, then the ethereals' presence only intrigues me further. I had thought him the only one of his kind, but now that I have seen another tangling with the Void...Come, we must play his game if we want to learn what he knows. He appears to have gone toward the Umbra Hollows to the north. 
Help Thalyssra complete the arcane communion with Theryn.	Scenes from a Memory	Theryn is at the mercy of his own mind. Whatever we find in there, it may be difficult to control. I will need your help to sort through the visions, so be ready for anything. With any luck, we will discover what makes Theryn special. And... whether there is anything left of who he used to be. 
Overcome the Trial of Tenacity.	Gatekeeper's Challenge: Tenacity	My master Archimonde was not known for his willingness to suffer indecision. He preferred to teach by rewarding frustration with more frustration-- punishment with more punishment. Absolute conviction was required to succeed under him. At the opposite end of the Conservatory you will find a large structure. Once inside, your goal is to overcome all the obstacles placed before you. Emerge unscathed and I will be forced to consider your will strong enough to proceed. 
Take the fish from Havi's Fish Barrel and skewer it on the spear above the fire.	A Heavy Burden	With Ashildir's judgment, your final trial is complete. But even Valhallas can wait, for now we must eat! Being dead works up quite an appetite. Come now, bring some of that fish to roast over the fire. It is far too heavy for me to carry. 
Evacuate Riverbend.	The Underking Comes	Here, I'm too slow to get these laggards to safety. Take my horn and sound the evacuation. We need to get the people out of here before the drogbar arrive. The warbraves can take it from there. For now just send them over to Spiritwalker Ebonhorn. That fool can watch over them until it is safe. 
Go to Tyr's Fall in Tirisfal Glades and recover the Silver Hand.	The Silver Hand	Too many know of its location, the tomb must be closed forever. First, we must reclaim the hammer. Tyrosus has lent us a force to aid in the recovery of the hammer, and some of my order will meet us there as well, but I fear even that may not be enough. I'm glad we'll have you with us. Take the portal to Dalaran Crater, then fly to Tirisfal Glades and meet us. I've marked the location on your map. 
Defeat 25 Legion.	Huln's War - The Arrival	Huln Highmountain is the origin of our strength as a tribe. He bested the Legion when last they threatened our survival and unified many disparate tribes. Live his story, and you will know why his name imbues courage in the cowardly and sows fear in the fearless. 
Chase the Lost Feathermane Kitten across the bridge and return it to its family.	Homeward Bounding	The first step to establishing a moonwell is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife. It is their good will that enables us to peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. Combined with Elune's light, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years. To begin, we must find creatures willing to give their blessing. We can start with these owl-cat creatures. They ran while you cleaned, but I saw one lingering just before the bridge. See if you can find where it lives! 
Activate the archive device to learn about the Trial of Might.	A Trial of Might	I owe you my gratitude for helping make me whole again, outsider. It is clear that you are worthy to take on the trials. Go now into the vault. There you will find the archive for the first trial you must undertake. I will meet you inside. 
Infuse the Essence of Light into the Netherlight Crucible.	An Offering of Light	I sense it. The nobility in Xe'ra's heart. Her relentless defiance of the Legion. Let this be her legacy. In building the Vindicaar, we fashioned the Netherlight Crucible to harness the tremendous powers at play on Argus. I believe Xe'ra's essence is one key to that potential. Yet the Light alone is not enough. Without balance, there can be no harmony, no cohesion. Infuse this essence into the crucible, champion. It is the first step in unlocking the strength needed to end the Burning Crusade. 
Take Advisor Vandros' Eon Winder from The Arcway on Mythic difficulty.	The Arcway: Rite of the Captain	Only a captain of the Guard may receive the power of our order - our ancient laws forbid otherwise. You must complete the rite of the captain. Traditionally, aspirants patrol the Arcway for three weeks without rest, the vast labyrinth putting their skills as a Guard to the test. Our laws must still be honored, but I believe there another way you may prove yourself. Elisandre's advisor, Vandros, has recently descended into the Arcway's depths. Kill him, and take his Eon Winder. 
Defeat God-King Skovald in the Halls of Valor and claim the Aegis of Aggramar.	Halls of Valor: Securing the Aegis	The Felskorn may be broken, but the head of the beast yet lives. The God-King will still vie for the Aegis if left unchecked. You, who have completed trials upon trials, must not let this come to pass. You must claim the Aegis over Skovald's broken bones! The Halls of Valor await! 
	Sharptalon Swarm!	 
Defeat Athissa.	The Head of the Snake	Those naga have the Tidestone shards, George. They will soon be dragging them into their watery holes, away from our reach. It would be wise to take out their leaders before that happens. 
Link Light's Judgment into the Vindicaar Matrix Core.	The Vindicaar Matrix Core	Much has happened on Argus that concerns me but none moreso than Xe'ra's fate. I wonder sometimes if we are doing the right thing? But we must carry on. I can rig the Matrix Core that powers the Vindicaar to allow you to call on the power of our guns when you have need of them on the planet. Go to the Matrix Core in the room at the heart of our ship. Once linked, whatever powers the core has installed now and in the future will be at your disposal. 
Defeat Fel Commander Xeritas in Azsuna.	Battle for Azsuna	The vile demon commanding the assault must be stopped. I can get us close, but once we're there I'll rely on you and your allies to help bring down the demonic forces. 
Speak to Nathanos Blightcaller at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.	Stormheim	It is good we found you, George! Nathanos Blightcaller, Champion of the Banshee Queen herself, sent for you in Dalaran. He made it sound urgent. He should be waiting for you in the Violet Citadel. Make haste! 
Toss ingredients from the Basket of Root Vegetables, Barrel of Crabs, and Hearty Vrykul Grains into Havi's Stewpot.	Havi's Test	I could sense your power the moment you arrived in this land. You carry great purpose and a heavy task. Know that the Aegis of Agrammar rests in the high halls of the All-Father. Only if you prove your valor, can you claim it against your foe. Many trials must you face for this, but first I must know your strength. My stew is incomplete, and my old bones couldn't carry the ingredients up the hill. You look like you have a good arm. Will you help an old man finish his stew? 
Escort Thalyssra to safety.	The Only Way Out is Through	I have much to tell you, but it is not safe to speak here. I cannot hold this barrier forever.<Thalyssra lifts a delicate flask to her lips. Her eyes shimmer as she takes a sip.>If we push through, we may find shelter up ahead. 
Infuse the leyline feed with Ancient Mana.	Leyline Feed: Halls of the Eclipse	<The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.> 
Find Rotbeak along the Bradensbrook, and collect the beast's head.	Shriek No More	Papa loved this village. He'd never hear of leaving, even in these dread times. Before he died, he told me what attacked him: a monstrous falcon we call Rotbeak. You're fighting these undead, aren't you? Will you avenge my father? If so, you can find the beast northwest of here, patrolling our western route to the sea. 
Find Lea Stonepaw.	Mistress of the Claw	The great forest guardian, Ursoc, gave his life for this world ten thousand years ago. After the guardian's death his claws were hidden away, safe from any who would use their power for evil. Lea Stonepaw and her Druids of the Claw consider Ursoc their paragon and dedicate their lives to following in his example. If anyone would know where the claws reside, it would be Lea. She and her Druids of the Claw reside in the Tel'Andu Barrow Den just to the north. 
Obtain Lykill's Key and free Stellagosa.	Saving Stellagosa	During the fighting, of all things, I saw a blue drake swoop in and attack the demons. I couldn't believe my eyes. I'd heard that the Blue Dragonflight had gone extinct. The Legion managed to bring the drake down, but not until after she'd killed a score of them. She was magnificent. Last I saw, they were dragging her in the direction of the southern camp. We should see if she's still alive. A dragon could prove a powerful ally. 
Find Looper Allen near the ship that's run aground on the east side of Mak'rana.	Maritime Law	Good <sir/madame>, a moment of your time. My fellow salvors and I could not help but notice yon ship that ran aground in the storm last night. A pity about its crew.<Mr. Shackles makes empathetic gestures.>Still, the law's the law. The maritime code is quite clear on the matter. If you find yourself out that way, would you mind terribly checking in on my acquisitions scout, Looper? I would have expected him back for tea some time ago. 
Locate the Captain's Chest below decks on the Queen's Reprisal.	The Captain's Foot Locker	I don't care what you do, mate. But, if you get caught, you didn't see me. I wasn't here. 
Acquire a Legion Communicator from demons in Astravar Harbor.	Missing Persons	Our new friend brings us some disturbing information. She claims to have seen a large number of citizens dragged from Starcaller Retreat in chains. Their destination appears to be Astravar Harbor. Those taken to the harbor have yet to return, however. Worse yet, the area is now overrun with demons. I need you to find out where these people went. Infiltrate the harbor and gather any information you can. Start with the Legion filth- their corpses may point us in the right direction. 
Meet Lasan Skyhorn at Skyhorn.	The Skyhorn Tribe	The Skyhorn people are some of the greatest pathfinders and hunters this world has ever known. They are a proud people, but should be willing to listen to reason. If the roads feel unsafe, you may ask any flight master in Highmountain to fly you there. Please, $p, go to their leader Lasan and remind him that only together, we are Highmountain. 
	Illidari Masters: Sissix	 
Repel the Legion threat from the Temple of a Thousand Lights, then Slay Portal-Keeper V'thaal and Zor'thaduun.	Presence of Power	The demons appear to be harnessing an ancient power within the Temple itself. They've managed to twist and corrupt these sacred grounds with fel magic. We must remove the demonic presence before we press our final advance. 
Select an artifact weapon to pursue.	Weapons of Legend	Our gathering has identified several weapons of immense power. In the right hands, these holy artifacts give us a fighting chance against the Legion. We cannot pursue all of them at once. We risk too much if we spread ourselves that thin. We must agree on where our efforts are best focused. That is why I asked you here, George. As one of our greatest champions, you must be our voice of reason and decide our next move. 
Infuse the leyline feed with Ancient Mana.	Leyline Feed: Falanaar Depths	<The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.> 
Take the Tears of Elune to Light's Heart in your Order Hall.	In the House of Light and Shadow	The Tears of Elune are ready for you, George. I am uncertain what to do from here. Take the relic back to your order hall and try to use it on Light's Heart. Maybe make them touch? Honestly your guess is as good as mine. Let's hope this works! 
Recover the forgotten loot from the Lich King and find its intended recipient at the Steam Pools in Feralas.	Priority Delivery	An adventurer of another time has forgotten to loot something big... something that might cause them great emotional strain if not received quickly. Your destination is Icecrown Citadel, your target the Lich King's corpse. Retrieve the missing item post-haste and deliver it to the stalwart adventurer - he should be somewhere at the Steam Pools in Feralas. My assistant will open a portal to deliver you there. Just a moment! 
Explore Moonshade Sanctum.	Cloaked in Moonshade	I do not know what Theryn found, but I know where he found it. Moonshade Sanctum, to the west. Beyond the Temple of Fal'adora. Whatever power altered Theryn's arcane essence... Whatever power allowed Kel'danath to create a spell to soothe the withered... Its source rests there. I know this as surely as if I had been there myself. 
Complete Sylvanas' mission to bring the fleet to Stormheim.	The Splintered Fleet	Preparations have been made, and we are ready to set sail. We must strike out at once. Do not dally, or you will be left behind. 
Collect the 5 Tidestone Shards.	The Tidestone: Shattered	I suppose you can go in, then. The shattered pieces of the Tidestone of Golganneth are contained within the academy's eastern wing. Even as curator, I cannot attest to their condition, as I have not been in to inspect them in many millennia. Oh, young George? Please do not touch anything. 
Secure the Aegis of Aggramar in the Chamber of the Guardian in Dalaran.	The Aegis of Aggramar	Now that it's out of the hands of the Legion, the Aegis should be brought back to Dalaran for safekeeping while the hunt continues for the rest of the Pillars of Creation. It should be safe in the central portal chamber until the time comes when it is needed. 
Meet Oakin Ironbull at Cliff's Edge.	The Bloodtotem Tribe	The Bloodtotem are led by Torok, a volatile but useful tauren chieftain. He is wary of outsiders, but I believe you have already met an emissary to their tribe--Oakin Ironbull--whom you rescued at Riverbend. Use that small thread and you may be able to bring the Bloodtotem back into the fold. Highmountain needs them if we are to defeat the drogbar and reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. Be on your guard, George. 
Collect Stolen Pylon Cores from enemies in Triumvirate's End and use them to activate 3 Ancient Pylons.	Defenseless and Afraid	This is the battle that raged while I awaited the Genedar. So many ran to join me, but Kil'jaeden inspired still more to stand in their way. My people were slaughtered without mercy. To cover our retreat I ordered for this arena's defenses to be activated. It is clear that they were unable. To turn the tide in this battle, to give these spirits rest, we must do what they could not. Find a way to activate the pylons. 
Organize the camp.	Feline Frantic	Greetings, stranger.<Mayruna bows to you.>We arrived from Val'Sharah a short time ago with hopes of settling here. Our journey was not easy and we are weary. These owlcats have made a mess of our camp, as you can surely see. Would you be so kind as to assist us with cleaning up? Then perhaps you can help us establish a new moonwell! 
Assist Arcanist Valtrois with placing ley line taps.	Unbeleyvable	Back to the task at hand! Take these ley line taps. We can use the resonant energies to properly redirect the flow, but they must be placed in precise locations. I will show you where. Your friend has agreed to... ""supervise"" us. Let us hope she just stays out of the way while the professionals take care of this. 
Follow Arkhaan to Isolon.	Arkhaan's Plan	Arkhaan remembers. He remembers something that will... yes... will save us. Follow Arkhaan. Isolon calls! We will offer soft words to the Light. The Light will banish the darkness.<Arkhaan eyes Alleria warily.>Arkhaan will watch that one closely. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	Eating Before the Meeting	Having Vanthir around has done much to lift the spirits of the people here. I dare say some have begun to relish their newfound freedom, even if they miss their beloved city. I will not rest until I can give it back to them. You and I have an important meeting to attend. Before we go, let us distribute more of the arcan'dor's fruit. I want people to know that although I must leave for now, I have not abandoned them. 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar to fly down to Azsuna.	Down to Azsuna	George, we must find a way to reseal the Tomb of Sargeras. I have uncovered information concerning an ancient relic, which might be the key to stopping the Legion. Our search begins on the ancient elven island of Azsuna. Long ago, it was where the Highborne elves of Suramar perfected their mightiest of magics. Now it is a cursed ruin. The Illidari demon hunters have established a camp on the island. As they are the only people we know in the area, that is where we will begin. Ready to take wing? 
Speak to Malfurion Stormrage at Lorlathil in Val'sharah.	Cenarius, Keeper of the Grove	Ahh, Val'sharah. It has been an age since I have set foot in these sacred woods. Too long...Our work here is simple, Mechanic. We must call upon my mentor, Cenarius, and learn where he safeguards the Tears of Elune. With them, you will be one step closer to sealing Sargeras' Tomb and thwarting the Legion. You have many treacherous tasks in front of you. Consider your visit here a brief respite. Come, this will not take long. 
Help Ritssyn investigate Levia's ritual.	The Acolyte Imperiled	Truthfully, the Council knows little of Agatha, but she is more than just your average succubus. She has many allies within the sayaad, and is known to command armies of imps that swarm and overwhelm her foes. To seek her out is folly, but Ritssyn Flamescowl repays his debts. Come, let us examine what manner of fel powers this little mage of yours was stumbling her way through... 
Get the end of the story from the spirit of the saga hero.	The End of the Saga	Ye should read the saga yerself, it's right here. We're here to speak to the spirit of that vrykul I spoke of. Tahu Sagewind is a powerful Seer and he should be able to bring his spirit back. It will be up to us to convince him to speak. You should speak with Tahu so we can get started. 
Collect bones from the Antoran Wastes to form a bone effigy.	The Many-Faced Devourer	<The scroll's runes shift to a more intelligible form.>An effigy. The Many-Faced One requires it. Steal from the Imps. Steal from the Fiends. Steal from the Ur'zul. He comes. 
Investigate the forgotten stacks in the Hall of the Guardian for clues to Ebonchill's last known master, Arrexis.	Finding Ebonchill	Ebonchill bears a lineage of powerful wielders dating back to its maker, Alodi. He passed it on to his favorite apprentice and so on until... the archmage Arrexis, I believe. Arrexis disappeared sometime around the First War. I know nothing of his fate, but the answer may well be somewhere in this library. Start by looking around here. Whatever you find should lead us to Ebonchill. 
Collect the Shard of Vorgos.	Shard of Vorgos	According to the wyrmtongue servant, there is a portal that will take you into the Burning Legion command ship. However, the portal is locked to those without the keys. The first key shard is held by an Ered'ruin known as Vorgos. He resides within the Fel Breach, which is at the end of the Arcway. Slay Vorgos and place the key shard into its position next to the portal. 
Slay Advisor Vandros in the Arcway.	The Arcway: Opening the Arcway	Deep beneath Suramar is a defunct set of tunnels known as the Arcway. They were abandoned when a disaster disrupted the mana collectors operating there. I know not what awaits you down there, but I do know one thing. We are not the only ones interested in this place. Make enough noise and one of the advisors with whom I served under Elisande is sure to appear. His name is Vandros. Slay him, if you can. His death will be our victory, as we deprive Elisande of one more weapon in her arsenal. 
Check on the Heathrow house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' fishing dock.	The Farmsteads	Forgive us, stranger. Mayor Heathrow has been under a lot of stress recently. I can't blame him: his own daughter, Penelope, has been missing for two days. In fact, we could use information on several farmsteads to the south: Mayor Heathrow's house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' dock. Can you go check on the situation out there? Help us, and perhaps the mayor's heart will soften. 
Free Okuna Longtusk and kill Prince Oceanus.	The Prince is Going Down	George! I knew you'd come. Quick, let me out of here and we'll take this giant down. 
Meet Meryl Felstorm in the Violet Gate in Dalaran.	Felstorm's Plea	You may not know me, but I need your help, George. Meet me in the Violet Gate and I'll explain everything. Make haste. I fear we have little time. 
Recover the Hammer of Khaz'goroth.	Neltharion's Lair: Death to the Underking	I will direct my people to clear a path through this rubble and assault Dargrul's forces directly. It will be a ruse. Navarrogg proposed a plan that I believe has merit. He knows of a side entrance that might lead directly to Dargrul. Muster what allies of yours you can and strike at them through this side passage. Recover the Hammer of Khaz'goroth before that villain brings the mountain down on top of us. We will provide the distraction you need to get a shot. 
Seek out Allari the Souleater at Illidari Stand in Azsuna.	The Hunt for Illidan Stormrage	Allari the Souleater, an oracle of the Illidari, has been on the hunt for Illidan's soul for quite some time. She now believes that she has discovered its location and requires your assistance in its recovery. Find Allari at Illidari Stand in Azsuna and aid her in any way possible. If Sargeras truly plans to use Illidan's body as a vessel for his own return then returning Illidan's soul to his body is integral in preventing the dark titan from returning to our world! 
Speak with Thaon Moonclaw.	Archdruid of the Vale	Deep within our forest lies Moonclaw Vale. There you will find a reclusive group of feral druids charged with the protection of Val'sharah from any that would seek to disrupt the balance of nature. These druids are led by Thaon Moonclaw, the most fierce of the Archdruids. Seek him out. Let him know that Cenarius is in need of his aid. 
Find Kor'vas Bloodthorn in the streets of Dalaran.	Vengeance: Seeking Kor'vas	Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city. One of your Illidari, Kor'vas Bloodthorn, has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks. I do not entirely trust your kind, but I will concede that you have at least proved adept at your namesake. I suggest you find Kor'vas and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.|cFF660000Specialization: Vengeance Demon Hunter|r 
Retrieve the Spellstone of Kel'danath.	Written in Stone	<You bundle the notes and store them away in your pack. According to his final journal entry, Kel'danath used something called a ""spellstone"" in his experiments. The spellstone, if not the arcanist himself, must be nearby.> 
Borrow a Rune of Portals from Archmage Celindra.	A Matter of Finesse	A rune of portals?! Who does Val'zuun think he is?<Valeera takes a deep breath.>It's worth the price, but those runes aren't exactly easy to come by. Unless...Archmage Celindra, the Kirin Tor's portal master, has a study in the center of town. We rogues aren't particularly welcome there, nor would she simply hand a rune over even if we were...<Valeera smirks.>But who said anything about asking? 
Await the opening of the Nighthold, then meet Archmage Kalec in Shal'Aran.	Planning the Assault	Thanks to your tireless efforts the Heart of Zin-Azshari is ready to withstand the full power of the Legion. The final destination in our journey has stood defiantly in front of us from the moment we began - the Nighthold, now home to none other than Gul'dan himself. We just need a way inside. I am working fervently with the rest of the Council of Six to secure an entrance. Once we have, we should reunite with the Moon Guard in Shal'Aran - we still have need of their skills. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	A Taste of Freedom	We are as ready as we will ever be. Once we put Valtrois' plan into action, we can attack the Sanctum of Order and put an end to Andaris. She will never expect us to have trained our withered against fel magic, and her hubris will be her downfall. Come, let us feed the people one last time. 
Descend to Eredath with Velen.	Eredath, Jewel of Argus	The shattered ruin below us is all that remains of Eredath. We called it the Jewel of Argus. It was here that my fellows in the triumvirate guided our people to prosperity. That was a long time ago.<Velen lapses into a moment of silence.>Join me on the surface. We will begin our search for the Crown of the Triumvirate. 
Follow Valewalker Farodin into the Falanaar Tunnels.	Into the Crevasse	I have protected that seed for ten thousand years. You let it fall into the hands of the fal'dorei. I should have let you die. Repay your debt. Help me get the seed back. 
	Withered Progress	 
Seek out Ashildir at the Vault of Eyir in Stormheim.	Seeking the Valkyra	We simply cannot risk another catastrophe like that; we have to protect the Heart against fel energy before we continue our work. The mighty Ashildir has proven willing to aid those who she deems worthy, and her master just may be able to help us protect the Heart. You should seek her out at the Vault of Eyir in Stormheim. I'll meet you there. 
Question the Underbelly Lowlifes in the Underbelly to find more information about Raest Magespear's location.	Secrets in the Underbelly	So my brother has gone off to perform some ritual with these cultists? That explains why he left, but still not to where...Wait! This letter mentions some of these ""Nethersworn"" cultists seeking reagents in the Underbelly. Perhaps we still may be able to find them if we hurry! 
Defeat Kathra'natir in Violet Hold.	The Dreadlord's Prize	Kathra'natir escaped my grasp, but I know what his next step will be. He seeks an ancient relic called the Forge of the Guardian, used for centuries by the Council of Tirisfal to infuse their power into the Guardian. The forge was hidden away, its location known only to the Council themselves. Now the dreadlord has this knowledge. We must go to the Violet Hold. I only hope we are not too late. 
Locate Zen'tabra and Naralex, and direct them to the ritual site.	Call of the Wilds	Beating the Legion requires us to strike quickly and unexpectedly. We have discovered a Dreamway by which we can travel through the Emerald Dream itself. Though only a short walk through the Dream, it will allow us to cross vast distances on Azeroth and even access the ancient home of all druids, Val'sharah. Malfurion is preparing the ritual to open the Dreamway. I need you to summon Zen'tabra and Naralex to his side. Only by combining our efforts can we hope to succeed. 
Follow Lady Sylvanas Windrunner and prepare her ship to set sail.	Making the Rounds	As you can see, we have spared no expense in showing our support of your great quest. Final preparations are being made - come, walk with me. 
Witness Ly'leth Lunastre's ascension to advisor.	In the Bag	Already the city is abuzz with outrage. I will not lie to you- it pleases me greatly that one such as Coryn is made a fool. The other houses have sent their endorsements. It is done, and nothing remains but a formal ceremony to grant me the title of advisor. Meet me there. You deserve to share in this success. 
Use the Bug Sprayer on drogbar in Whitewater Wash.	Spray and Prey	The Bug Sprayer you recovered from Ormgul the Pestilent seems like it could give us an advantage against the drogbar and their insects. Spray the Drogbar with their own alchemy and watch their insects turn against them. 
Slay 12 Broken in Oronaar Collapse.	Arkhaan's Pain	Darkness envelops us... the Light has gone from this place...<Arkhaan mumbles to himself before noticing you are still talking to him.>Arkhaan could not save them. Brothers. Sisters. Whispers twisted them. The Light cannot see them. It turns away from us. Arkhaan failed.<Arkhaan stares off into space.> 
Bandage Thalyssra.	The Nightborne Pact	<Thalyssra winces and holds her abdomen.>Ngh... I can ignore this wound no longer. Help me patch this up. I will explain everything. 
	Fight Night: Sir Galveston	 
	Enigmatic	 
Acquire a Volatile Spell Focus.	Recovering Stolen Power	My injuries will not kill me, but I cannot fight. I have my own idea of how to deal with the remaining Nightborne. They destroyed our defense matrix as soon as they arrived. Surely one of them carries the spell focus necessary to reactivate it. Find it, then go to a hippogryph. They linger throughout the Stronghold. These loyal beasts will take you to the skies and take care of the rest. 
Aid Valtrois underneath the Sanctum of Order in Suramar City.	Scouting the Breach	If Ly'leth's information is accurate, there is a breach in the Sanctum of Order that could be our only way into the Nighthold. No doubt they have magically sealed it - take Valtrois and protect her while she examines the seal. She is an exceptional talent, and I have total faith in her ability to break whatever enchantment they have cooked up. Valtrois has her own methods of getting into the city and will meet you inside the Sanctum of Order. 
	Bareback Brawl	 
	Vignette: Guarms Mate (Fenri)	 
	WANTED: Nameless King	 
Hunt down Highmountain's Bane.	The Spear in the Shadow	Many years ago, a corrupted nightsaber hunted my people. Our chieftain, Dorro Highmountain, took Talonclaw and pursued the beast, but never returned. I have heard tales of a fearsome nightsaber that now stalks the mists of Stormheim. My brother and I believe this to be our ancient foe. The weapon must be there too! If we kill the beast and reclaim the spear, it will be of great use against the Legion. 
Gather pet supplies along the shores of Eye of Azshara with Speedy IV.	The Coast is Clear	I was on the last leg of a supply run when we were shot down! They took the pets, but the supplies are scattered over this stretch of beach. I don't know what they're planning, but I know we gotta get our supplies. You an' me, we ain't subtle.... But Speedy IV... He won't cause all them pirates to go into hiding. He can get the supplies while Stringfellowe surveils the area from the air. Speedy's fond of you, so chat him up and let's try to recover the smoldering supplies before they all burn up. 
Search Thalyssra's estate and collect her belongings.	Thalyssra's Drawers	Thalyssra's ransacked estate still contains a number of items important to Thalyssra. Collect them and return them to her. 
Activate the beacon.	The Way Back Home	Hello? This is Chief Telemancer Oculeth. I see you have emerged safely! I am locking in your location as we speak. I will need you to activate the beacon on your end so we can establish a teleportation link. Got it? Good. 
Complete the lockdown sequence in Oculeth's Test Chamber.	Network Security	We must lock down the facility. Otherwise my esteemed colleagues from the palace could uncover my secrets, which puts any teleporters I build for you and Thalyssra at risk.<The inactive attunement device near Oculeth hums to life.>This will take us to my secret test chamber beneath the mountain. From there we can begin the lockdown sequence and make our escape! 
Help Thalyssra complete the Scrying Ritual.	On Public Display	Now that I have identified Vanthir's essence from the multitude of Suramar's citizens, it may be that I can find his exact location. I believe you'll recall a similar ritual with our friend Theryn. Do not worry- there will be less screaming this time. Hopefully. Come. Let us find our missing tavernkeeper. 
Travel to Dalaran and fly upon Zeomus to Darkstone Isle. While there, travel through the Demon Portal, find Baron Sliver, and obtain the Maw of the Damned.	The Dead and the Damned	<A powerful mind again touches your thoughts.>Gorelix the Fleshripper is a monstrous demon. The butcher of a thousand worlds, he has exterminated countless races with his axe, the Maw of the Damned. A group of Ebon Blade was dispatched to slay him but they have gone missing. You will succeed where they failed. You will not be alone in this, I've sent Baron Sliver ahead to assist you. Go, obtain the Maw of the Damned and ensure that Gorelix is no more. 
Bring the Fel-Ravaged Tome to Robert Newhearth in Dalaran.	Cursed Tome	Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire. The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills. Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility. 
	Behind Enemy Portals	 
	Rolling Thunder	 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	Before the Siege	So many years of my life spent studying within the Nighthold... Never had I considered that I would one day have to fight my way back in. Time is short. The battle will be upon us soon. Please, continue our tradition and feed another refugee the fruit of the arcan'dor. 
Discover Archmage Modera's message by using the Glowing Resonate Crystal.	An Unexpected Message	Ah, Felo'melorn. I am familiar with this weapon. For ages the Council of Tirisfal attempted to recover the blade. Its control over the primal forces of fire would be devastating in the wrong hands. As luck would have it, an associate of mine, Archmage Modera has recently uncovered some information on this artifact. This crystal contains a message from her. I suggest you start your search there. The portal over there will bring you back to the city. 
Get the Fighter Chow from Ooka Dooker	Morale Booster	Things may look good from where you're standing, but, we're losing. However, do not fret, my little Human friend. You can help. Listen closely. Ooka Dooker, Ooker's sister, is back over yonder in the champions' cave making her world famous Fighter Chow. It'll do the trick and boost our team's morale. All you have to do is to convince her to hand it over. 
Attract 3 Wild Moonfall Hippogryphs to deal with the Nightborne at Moonfall Roost.	Take Them in Claw	We should have seen this coming. My sister is dead, my friends are wounded and we will likely die here. I want revenge.<Lyrea hands you a vial full of growing green liquid.>We cannot beat them, but we can turn the Stronghold against them. Wild hippogryphs are attracted to the scent in this bottle. Wild hippogryphs are also notoriously violent when the object of their attraction is not a hippogryph. Use it to clear a path deeper into the stronghold. 
Speak to your contacts in Dalaran to acquire intel on Akaari Shadowgore's whereabouts.	The Shadows Reveal	The Fangs of the Devourer are wielded by Akaari Shadowgore, one of Kil'Jaeden's personal assassins. Every attempt on her life ends the same... she's gone before we even arrive.<Valeera scrawls a few lines on a piece of paper, then hands it to you.>But not this time. We've been working with these contacts to find Akaari so we can finally take the Fangs for our own purposes. Go to each contact and tell them ""The shadows reveal."" See what they know. 
Return to Arch Druid Greathoof in the Dreamgrove.	The Dreamer Returns	Arch Druid Greathoof will be expecting word on the success of our mission, but I'm afraid I must ask you to return alone. I can't rest knowing that Xavius has Lord Ursoc in his clutches. Just the thought of it makes me shake with rage! I'll find where he has been taken if I have to search every corner of Azeroth! Our paths will cross again, George. Be sure of it. 
Infuse the Telemancy Beacon with Ancient Mana.	Sanctum of Order Teleporter Online!	<The telemancy beacon is deactivated, but intact. Some Ancient Mana should get it back up and running.> 
Recover Addie's manuscript from Sated Hillstriders within Pinerock Basin.	Note-Eating Goats	I've followed Hemet on all his expeditions from Stranglethorn to Nagrand to... Nagrand again, taking notes on his grand adventures and turning them into timeless literary tales. But my heart is really in the hunt. I want nothing more than to put down the pen, and pick up a rifle! Hemet promised to teach me how to hunt once I finish his latest novel, but the goats around here ate my first draft! I have no hope of becoming a hunter if my manuscript isn't recovered. 
	DANGER: Deepclaw	 
Speak with Emmarel Shadewarden in Dalaran.	Needs of the Hunters	The eagle appears to have a message for you:|cFF660000 To: George|rThe time has come to strike back at the Legion. Meet me at Hunter's Reach in Dalaran as soon as you can.|cFF660000 |r-Emmarel Shadewarden 
Defeat Tichondrius.	Huln's War - The Nathrezim	I am fully occupied here organizing my troops and planning for the battle to come. While I would like to slay the Dreadlord Tichondrius myself, I will allow that honor to be yours, Huln Highmountain. 
Enter the Guo Lai Halls in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and collect the Edict of Stone, the Edict of Fire, and the Edict of the Storm. Cleanse the area by slaying mogu spirits.	The Codex of Ra	The Thunder King conquered Pandaria using power stolen from the Titan Keeper Ra, known as ""Ra-den"" in the mogu tongue. If you truly seek to wield the relics of the Highkeeper, seek out his ancient edicts among the ruins in the heart of the mogu empire: The Edict of Stone, The Edict of Fire, and the Edict of the Storm. These pieces of the codex are scattered amongst the Guo-Lai Halls in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, one in each wing. 
Acquire the Suramar Leyline Map from the Arcway.	The Arcway: Long Buried Knowledge	Beneath Suramar City is an ancient network of tunnels known as the Arcway. They were abandoned some time ago as part of the cavern became unstable. Since then, who knows? Regardless of what is currently down there, I believe you will find something essential to our continued success. Long ago my people took a thorough survey of the ley lines in and around Suramar. This they would have stored in the library in the Arcway. Find this map for me. 
	Supplies Needed: Stonehide Leather	 
Use the Teleportation Pad outside Ulduar to rendezvous with Mimiron in his workshop.	Spark of Imagination	I've diverted all non-essential power to prepare for Hati's reformation, so I cannot teleport you to Ulduar from here. Be extremely careful with the Thunderspark on your way. It is charged with highly volatile energy. One wrong bump could lead to serious complications! 
Seek out the Council of Six in the Violet Citadel.	The Council's Call	I'm sorry that I haven't kept your apprised of the situation. We needed more actionable information before bringing the matter before you. The Council of the Six has been investigating Legion threats outside of the Broken Shore. I believe this scroll to be the final piece of information we need. Meet me in Dalaran at the Violet Citadel. We will need the other members of the Council. 
Mark the Argussian Heartwells for the Vindicaar's guns, kill the Legion garrison, and retrieve the Fel Heart of Argus from High Inquisitor Raalgar.	Long Overdue	I have learned much. High Inquisitor Raalgar has moved to a base near the Legion citadel across the mountains. This is where he keeps the Fel Heart of Argus, the source of his immortality, and it is powered by wells leading directly to the core of Argus. He is preparing to attack so you will strike first. Mark the location of the wells and I will rain holy fire upon them with the Vindicaar's guns. With that connection to the fel on Argus broken, Raalgar can be killed and the Fel Heart retrieved. 
	Shock Absorber	 
Use Light's Judgment to destroy the rubble blocking the entrance to the Xenedar.	Lightly Roasted	Can you hear me, George? Good. Light's Judgment has been installed on the Vindicaar. We should be able to harness its power immediately. We can use it both to clear the rubble blocking the Xenedar as well as destroy our enemies. As with any new piece of technology, we should test it out. Thoroughly. I trust you have plenty of targets down there. 
Defeat Lord Nath'raxas.	Lord of the Spire	Lord Nath'raxas rules over this hold as thanks for his role in delivering Argus to the Legion many years ago. Make no mistake, he is powerful, but he has also grown overconfident in his seat. Take advantage of his hubris and make use of the warframe's firepower while you can. We will storm the courtyard shortly! 
Investigate leads on three artifact weapons.	The Hunter's Call	I realize we have never met, but you will learn of my order soon enough. For now, pleasantries must wait. The Legion has returned to Azeroth stronger than ever, and we need new weapons to fight them. I have met three individuals here in Dalaran who have leads on ancient artifacts which could prove vital in the battle to come. Acquiring these weapons demands the skills of a master hunter. Speak to each of them and decide whom you will aid first. 
Accompany King Anduin on his walk through Stormwind.	A Kingdom's Heart	My father was a legend. He oversaw the rebuilding of Stormwind, stood toe-to-toe with dragons, led the Alliance to numerous victories. Then, one day, he was just... gone. I wear his crown, I hold his title. But I've done nothing to earn them... or the faith of my people. I've spent the war sequestered in the keep, surrounded by guards and advisors. I need to walk the streets of Stormwind, to know whether it is hope or fear that beats in the hearts of my people. I welcome your company. 
	Behind Legion Lines	 
Deliver Light's Heart to Khadgar at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.	The Nighthold	Illidan's soul rests safely within Light's Heart. Take this vessel and deliver it to Khadgar with the following instructions:When Gul'dan attempts to tear the sky asunder and bring the dark titan into our world, call forth the power of this vessel and release Illidan's soul into his body. Go now, George. We do not have much time. The dark ritual will begin soon. 
Stop the ritual and acquire Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire.	Blade in Twilight	I have been working with Moira Thaurissan to infiltrate the Twilight's Hammer cult. We've learned of an ancient and powerful Old God relic, a blade used at various points in history to wreak havoc. Moira's double agent informs us a new leader is rising, and plans to cement his ascension using this weapon in an unholy ritual. You must find him, stop the ritual, and seize the artifact. We will meet in Dalaran afterwards. 
Speak with Artificer Shela'na, Thelbus Wimblenod and High Priestess Ishanah.	A Moment of Respite	For all we have seen, we must remember not to dwell on the past, but to look forward and prepare for what is to come. Take this opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Vindicaar. 
Go to Dragonblight in Northrend and find Galford and his Spark of Tyr.	The Brother's Trail	We must reclaim the Silver Hand before those with evil intent can seize it. To free it from its wards, we need relics called the Sparks of Tyr. I have one, as does my brother, Galford. He journeyed to Northrend to seek aid from the Tyr's homeland, but has not returned. I must ask you to find him, and his Spark. 
Absorb the power from the Twisted Runebindings using the Heart of Zin-Azshari.	A True Test	Vizuul's runebindings are more potent than I had anticipated. Not a bad thing - more power is certainly welcome - but there's certainly more potential for catastrophe if the spell matrix somehow becomes unstable. We should be able to safely contain the fel energy within the containment field using the eon winder you recovered... but keep an eye open just in case. 
Allow Runas to escort you.	Runas Knows the Way	I wish to make it up to you for whatever I did that made you want to kill me. Hmm... your dragon complains about being weak. I know why. Runas can fix it, my friend. One of my kind, Ael'Yith, pulls ley energy from the very ground of Azsuna. I can take you to the location of his mana siphons. It's not too late to undo the harm the others have done. You've done well to trust me. 
Meet Silgryn at Evermoon Terrace.	Disillusioned Defector	The atmosphere in the city has improved little, but we may find this to our advantage today. Silgryn asks for you at the Terrace. It seems even Elisande's forces are fleeing before her insanity. A defector has risen from the ranks and seeks to join our cause. See that this individual is well received, George. We need all the friends we can get during these dark times. 
Destroy 4 Portal Crystals.	Crystal Clearing	This portal is a problem. With it they can summon countless reserves. The crystals nearby seem to be powering the gate. If we destroy those, we can set them back significantly. 
Receive the Eagle Spirit's blessing at Spiritwatch Point in Highmountain.	The Eagle Spirit's Blessing	The spear is linked to a spirit called Ohn'ahra. It has been tradition for us to speak with her and receive her blessing before going after the spear. She may also impart some knowledge. If you would accompany me to Spiritwatch Point, I will summon the Eagle Spirit and ask for its blessing in the coming fight. 
Participate in a juicing demonstration.	The Old Fashioned Way	While you experienced the raw majesty that is Nightwell Infusion, Margaux was busy preparing another demonstration for you. Head across the bridge and to the left, then again across a bridge and to your right. You will find her on the juicing veranda. Enjoy the remainder of your tour!<Sylverin offers an intensely fake smile.> 
Speak with Farondis and hear his account of how he saved you.	Save Yourself	Of course I couldn't sit back and let them just cart you away. I will explain everything. 
Slay 1 Felwing Devourers.	Treasure Master Iks'reeged	<TEMP> Board the ship then kill fel bats. 
Deal with Vigfus Bladewind's warband and claim his blades.	The Hunter of Heroes	Helya has made a mockery of my order by creating her own ""helarjar"", powerful undead tasked with hunting down heroic warriors and taking their souls before my val'kyr can claim them. Among them is her personal champion, Vigfus Bladewind, who wields stolen blades I forged myself long ago. He has returned to Tideskorn Harbor with a full cargo of stolen souls to take to Helheim. Go there, kill him and his helarjar, and make the swords yours. 
Bring the Whispering Felflame Crystal to Aridormi in Dalaran, floating above the Broken Isles.	Whispering Felflame Crystal	The crystal pulses with an eerie, felfire green glow. Holding it, you hear faint echoes of guttural demonic voices. Although the words are jumbled, one is both decipherable and repeated often: Dalaran. Perhaps someone in the city floating over the Broken Isles can tell you more about this crystal and its purpose. 
Speak with Tyrande Whisperwind in Meredil.	Tyrande's Command	Shal'aran is bursting at the seams with refugees and rebels. We practically have an army now but not enough weapons or mana to keep everyone armed and un-withered. And in all of this, Tyrande has a battery of requests I simply do not have the time to deal with. Will you go to her? Her growing army is hard to miss in Meredil. 
Gather Travard and Orik Trueheart, then meet Lord Maxwell Tyrosus at Krasus' Landing.	An Urgent Gathering	A critical decision must be made, George. The Legion devastated our forces at the Broken Shore. The mightiest army this world has ever known was reduced to cinders in moments. We must gather those with the conviction to save our home. Travard of Tyr's Guard and Orik Trueheart have each made plans to do just that, but we must not let them walk alone. I ask that you seek them out and guide them to Krasus' Landing so that we may make this decision together. 
	Bloodgazer Swarm!	 
Test the withered's resistance against fel magic at Felsoul Hold.	The Felsoul Experiments	Andaris's control over the withered poses a real threat. If we are to increase the withered's resistance against these effects, we must do so in an environment built from this very magic. Head for Felsoul Hold at once. When you arrive, I will send withered to aide in your efforts. It is of the utmost importance you do not leave until you are certain the experiments yield the appropriate results. 
Use the Thunderspark to summon an Essence of Hati.	Reverberation	Hati's spirit is bound to yours forevermore, hunter. But it also now carries a link to the Temple of Storms--as well as Silithus, I fear. The Thunderspark shares these same bonds. By physically linking it here, you can call upon the different aspects of Hati's spirit and bind them to yourself as well. Do not worry. Skoll and I will guard the Thunderspark with our very lives! It will be safe. 
Travel to the Temple of the White Tiger and prove yourself worthy to wield the weapons of storm!	The Voice of Thunder	The White Tiger has prepared a series of challenges for everyone who wants to possess the weapons of the storm. Now you know of their power - these are the very artifacts that Ra-den himself wielded during the age of the Titans. Come! I have led arena teams to victory across three continents. With me in your corner, you cannot lose! 
Meet with Duke Lankral at Krasus' Landing.	The Call To War	<A chilling thought brushes your mind.>Hear me, George. The Legion has returned. They hope to control us, to bend us to their will. Fools - they only walk back within reach of our blades. Your brethren within Dalaran have begun to gather at Krasus' Landing. Go, meet with Duke Lankral and all will be explained. 
	Work Order: Auto-Hammer	 
Slay 50 Nightmare Creatures in Shala'nir riding the Subdued Nightwing.	Softening the Target	The Archdruid's end draws near. His memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew him. Elothir's desperate efforts revealed that Malfurion is being held in Shala'nir, amidst the roots of Shaladrassil. My love. So near, yet so far....Shala'nir is infested with Nightmare creatures. To rush in would be suicide. I subdued one of Xavius' creatures. Use it against him, George and clear us a path. 
Obtain the Fists of the Heavens.	Into The Heavens	This stone is saturated with elemental power, possibly the remnant of the magic used against Irmaat! If you went outside and held the stone aloft, it should unleash the stone's essence as a mighty whirlwind. So potent a windstorm could carry you and your companion all the way to Skywall! If the hand blades of Irmaat, the Fists of the Heavens, are as powerful as the old tales say, they would certainly be found there. 
Follow Prophet Velen.	The Prophet's Gambit	I can feel their presence just ahead. It is as faint as the lightest breeze that once rolled across these hills, but it is not of the Legion, of that I am certain. We must see if these broken are potential allies. It is a great risk, but our numbers are too few to ignore the chance. 
Meet Lord Ravenholdt in the Uncrowned Vault.	One More Thing...	Firstly, allow me to congratulate you. I know of no one more deserving of the title of Shadowblade. But there's one more thing. Meet me over near the forge. 
Reach Revered with The Nightfallen.	Growing Strong	Magic has long been a vice of the elves. It shaped us, and lifted us out of the darkness - but without balance, it also threatens to unmake us. The shal'dorei are too proud to admit it, but they are the product of indulgence. They live without harmony. But I sense potential among the Nightfallen. Losing everything has humbled them. It has made them stronger. Stay the course, $p. Help the Nightfallen rise up. 
Speak to Danise Stargazer and travel to Ashamane's Fall in search of Delandros Shimmermoon.	The Shrine of Ashamane	The mighty Ancient, Ashamane, fell in battle against the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago. To honor her sacrifice, a group of devoted druids called the Ashen forged Ashamane's fangs into powerful daggers. Take my signet and present it to their leader, Delandros Shimmermoon. He will know that you have my blessing. Our flight master, Danise Stargazer, can see you to the shrine. 
Drain the fel energies from the spirits of the Blind Marshlands.	The Tainted Marsh	I wasn't able to scout inside the village yet, however, there are more dangerous experiments going on to the south. They were befouling the unquiet spirits in the marshlands with more fel magic! I will rework this fel totem to draw out the fel energies they infused in those spirits. Please, cure what spirits you can, perhaps it will even give them some peace. If you want, I can even send you there! 
Read the Royal Summons and follow Nathanos Blightcaller through the portal to Durotar.	The Warchief Beckons	Greetings, $p. I am here on behalf of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. I should hope you recognize the name.<Nathanos thrusts a sealed envelope into your hand.>Read it and follow me. You can read, can't you? 
Slay Naxa, Arxas, and Xist.	Battle Worms	Snowmane Village behind us was caught completely off guard by the scale of this attack. I will hold the drogbar line here so the civilians have time to prepare their evacuation. The drogbar are using worms to burrow their way to the surface and deploy their troops. I am giving you command of our forces. Use them to slay these worms and cut off enemy reinforcements. 
Accompany Grif Wildheart to Shield's Rest Island and track down Titanstrike.	Stolen Thunder	Titanstrike is in the tomb of Warlord Volund somewhere on the isle of Shield's Rest. It's a dank, sloppy mess adrift in a sea of gloom. Sounds lovely, eh? I've been workin' with a vrykul guide named Prustaga. She'll help us break the wards keepin' the tomb sealed. I know what you're thinkin'... vrykul are trouble. But she hasn't taken a swing at me just yet. Huey'll take us down to the shore. Prustaga's probably found the tomb by now! 
Obtain the Fangs of the Devourer from Akaari Shadowgore.	Fangs of the Devourer	If you spare me I can use the rune of portals you provided to open a gateway to Akaari's citadel in the Twisting Nether. Of course, killing the Legion's master assassin in her own domain will be no simple feat, but surely the Fangs of the Devourer are worth the risk, no?<Val'zuun smiles.>I will guide you through the citadel once you arrive, but you will have to defeat Akaari on your own. 
Raise 6 Champions to 925 Item Level.	Relics of the Ancient Eredar	I failed Arkhaan. I won't fail again. If there is to be any hope of freeing the krokul, the ethereal threat must be removed from Eredath. L'ura has been vanquished, but the void clings heavily near the Shadowguard Incursion. Before we commence, ensure your forces are protected from the shadow. Your champions should seek ancient eredar armaments in the nearby ruins. 
Collect a Bottle of Airspark, Mu'sha's Tears, and Darkshard Crystal.	To See the Past	I would like for you to experience firsthand what Huln Highmountain was able to accomplish in a single battle during the War of the Ancients. To do so, I will need very specific ingredients. They are not too difficult to obtain--you can find all of them near Thunder Totem. 
Evacuate Red Skymane, Tarvim Daywalker, and Old Nefu.	Evacuate Snowmane	They just keep coming! And now my scouts report some of the drogbar have managed to sneak around our flank and are attacking Snowmane Village. Go, help the evacuation. We will hold the line here and try to buy you some time. 
Speak to Jarod Shadowsong at Ravencrest Mausoleum.	Jarod's Mission	Since Maiev chased after Gul'dan at the Vault of the Wardens, her sisters among the Wardens have been searching far and wide for her whereabouts. With so few Wardens remaining, I volunteered to join the search. I hope I will find sign of her within Black Rook Hold. The fortress will be well guarded, and I will need help to break through. Help me find her, and I will reward you handsomely. 
Kill 12 of Elisande's Forces in the Waning Crescent, Starcaller Retreat, and Siren's Vigil.	Answering Aggression	I weep for the Nightborne this day.<Silgryn gestures out the door.>Elisande demonstrates the ultimate disdain for her people. So many lives... wasted! All to relay a message: This is what happens to those who defy her. George, my friend, we must answer her. We must show her that she cannot slay her people without retribution. Fight back, George. 
Use Calydus's portal to enter into Felsoul Hold and recover the Skull of the Man'ari.	Dark Whispers	Felsoul Hold is not far away, but it is well defended. Very tough to get in the normal way, but Calydus can help you sneak in! There is a portal that my kind use to haul in treasures, with it you can get in and find the skull! 
	DANGER: Mortiferous	 
Fly to the Tainted Scar in the Blasted Lands and get information from Daio the Decrepit.	Daio the Decrepit	That text lists someone named Daio as being instrumental to the demonic ritual. They can't possibly mean Daio the Decrepit! I never knew he was Kirin Tor. I only know him as an elderly warlock who trains young recruits in the infernal arts. This would certainly explain his change of occupation. He most likely holds key information for this to work. Though retired, I believe he is still out in the Tainted Scar in the Blasted Lands. You should seek him out. 
Speak to Vanthir.	Seek the Unsavory	This is just... unspeakable. Margaux risked everything to get these mana wyrms to us. I cannot let it end this way. I need you to find someone who can make this right. Someone who will do whatever it takes to see Overseer Durant slain. Speak with Vanthir. I am certain he will know exactly who we need. 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Inches from Madness.""	The Ruins of Oronaar	Many krokul wander the city below, shrouded in shadow. I will not accept that they are all beyond redemption. Arkhaan was a leader, once. Some among his followers may still reside in the ruins of Oronaar, straddling the thin divide between reason and oblivion. Enlist the aid of your order. Scour the ruins for any that can be saved. 
Slay a Fal'dorei Webslinger, a Fal'dorei Broodcaller, and a Fal'dorei Widowmaker.	Moonshade Holdout	<Tampering with the relic has drawn the attention of some hideous creatures from beneath Falanaar.> 
Teleport to the Hall of the Guardian and return to Meryl Felstorm.	The Champion's Return	I can sense the power of the artifact you hold. It will do well against the Legion as it is, but we have the ability to unlock its power even further. You must return to the Hall of the Guardian. You can use the incantation I taught you before to pass through the runes. 
Follow Margaux through the Vineyard. Exchange information where possible.	How It's Made: Arcwine	<Margaux speaks in a hushed tone.>While we walk through the Vineyard, we may find time to exchange information. Try not to look alarmed at what you see, hm?<Margaux flashes a vacant, forced smile.>Shall we press on? 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Gambit in the Wastes.""	Hindering the Legion War Machine	Mechanict, I could use your help. The Army of the Light is coordinating an attack against the Spirit Crucible, Terminus, and Shaper's Rise to cripple the Legion's ability to wage war outside of the Antoran Wastes. We do not have enough soldiers to defend our footholds and execute this operation. Will you approach the Mechanics on our behalf? This gambit could succeed with them fighting by our side. We can paralyze the Legion war machine. 
Choose a second artifact to pursue.	Another Weapon of Old	You have done well but our foes are powerful and cunning. It would be wise to be prepared for whatever they may unleash upon us. You would be wise to consider obtaining another of the weapons of old to aid in our conflict. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. 
Choose a second artifact to pursue.	Continuing the Legend	There are still two paths you may walk - two powerful weapons you might yet obtain to aid you in the fight against the Legion. I will help you recall your remaining options, of course. 
Meet with Valorn Stillbough in the Twilight Grove in Duskwood.	The Scythe of Elune	I have received word that Tyrande herself has authorized the release of a great artifact, the Scythe of Elune, to aid our cause. Valorn Stillbough has agreed to give up the weapon, which he has kept as part of an investigation into the cursed worgen of Duskwood. I believe that you, champion, will be our best hope at wielding its power without succumbing to the animal rage that ebbs within. You must go to Duskwood, and take up the scythe against our foes! 
Slay Lady Heretica and Mistress Apostriss.	Heralds of Apocalypse	We've been presented with a rare opportunity. Our scouts have spotted two shivarra priestesses in the western fel pools enhancing the Legion's war effort. The inner circle of Sargeras' chosen never leave the walls of Antorus. If we take them out, we might be able to sow fear among those closest to the Dark Titan. 
Slay Siegebrul Olgrul.	The Siegebrul	Worms do not like battle or the surface. They only go where their master tells them. So, when in war, kill the master. Siegebrul Olgrul is the master of worms for the Mightstone drogbar who attack us from the north. Slay him. 
Go to Caer Darrow in Western Plaguelands and find out about the Shadow Council ritual.	Finding the Scepter	Very powerful, but difficult to acquire. Scepter is in the hands of Gul'dan. We must find out his plans, get close. Calydus know Gul'dan planning major operation. He has sent out a call to arms to all Shadow Council to help with big ritual. One such group at Caer Darrow, talking to the necromancers there. You should go, find out about plan. 
Collect the Jailer's Shard from Dravax and free Vethir from his prison.	A Familiar Fate	We had come to defend the Halls of Valor... I was taken from the sky...I cannot break free of my bindings. Find the jailer who made this cell...Set me free, friend... 
Meet with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection: Crafting War	Refugees are flooding in to Shal'Aran, and many are willing to fight for Thalyssra's rebel army. They need weapons, training and help from anyone who can provide it. Go to Shal'Aran and lend your assistance. 
Return to Calydus in The Underbelly in Dalaran.	The Power Possessed	I was wrong about you, warlock. Your assistance against the Dark Riders has proven a great service to the Light. Perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Nevertheless, you have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners. As for Ulthalesh, I can think of no safer place than in your care. May it serve you well against the Legion, warlock. 
Free Sirius Ebonwing, Cassiel Nightthorn, and Asha Ravensong.	Illidari Freedom	<The Illidari demon hunter is bleeding from several ghastly wounds. It appears he was left here to die.>Within the prison are three of my... <cough>... comrades. We were taken by surprise while scouting the area. I am not long for this world, but please, save them. 
	A Tainted Vintage	 
Speak to Grand Artificer Romuul to disembark the Vindicaar.	Alone in the Abyss	Champion, we will suffer the same fate as the Army of the Light if the Legion fires that infernal weapon upon us. We must descend into the siege camp below and destroy it while we still can! 
Assist with the ritual.	The Dreamway	The preparations for the ritual are now complete. Come with me, George, I will guide you to the ceremony. 
Defeat Jagganoth and take his heart to the Seat of the Overlord in Dreadscar Rift.	The Heart of the Dreadscar	Friend has the artifact! Now Jagganoth does not stand a chance! Quickly, you must go back to Dreadscar Rift! You may still be able to save your friends from Jagganoth's vengeance. If you take the heart of the overlord, his army will be yours to command! 
	Feed Thalyssra	 
Defeat Grand Vizier Jarasum, Arc-Consul Velara, and High Wakener Aargon.	Gatekeeper's Challenge: Mastery	Archimonde was an individual consumed by the pursuit of power. Only those who could match his lust would fare well under his tutelage. You will fight what remains of Archimonde's greatest pupils. These three once held such power in their own disciplines that the Conservatory remembers them now. Their echoes will try to kill you. Best all three with all your limbs intact and I will recognize your strength. 
Mindmeld with Murky and slay 10 Cavemoss Clackers.	Murlocs: The Next Generation	The time has come! Murky and his followers need a place to hide out and train--away from the mature murlocs--so that they can prepare to take over in the future. There's a nice cave not too far away... only problem is that it's filled with makrura. This would be a good base for the tadpoles. Murky must go show them what for! Mindmeld with Murky in his egg and show him how it's done! 
Release the whelplings on each of the Mana Collector Pylons in Zarkhenar.	You Scratch My Back...	Much better. I knew I could count on you, my friend. Allow me to return the favor. I know how you can destroy the large mana collector pylons. We shall save your dragon yet! The pylons only work against ground targets, yet they're defenseless from above. Send your whelplings at them, my friend. The whelplings can fly where we cannot. Trust me. 
Rescue Jale Rivermane, Warbrave Oro, and Oakin Ironbull.	Grasp of the Underking	If we have one good fortune in this it is that Dargrul has no knowledge of how to use the hammer. He keeps thinking of the hammer as a weapon instead of a tool of creation. Even so, he has imprisoned our tribesman in fists of stone summoned from the earth. Our weapons have proven useless against this magic. You might have power enough to break these fists. Can you help? 
Free Cleave Thunderhill, Gentle Rosh, and Grace the Green.	A Favor for Mr. Shackle	Throm'ka, Mechanic. My name is Seska. I represent a... trading company. As you can see, I've fallen victim to these giants and their naga allies. Three of my associates were also captured while surveying this cove. I'm certain that my employer, Mr. Shackle, would be most grateful if you could procure their release. 
	Azsuna Specimens	 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	A United Front	Our rebel fighters have been armed and morale is high - even the Alliance and Horde elves have ceased their squabbling. We are nearly ready to march on the city. Hand out this week's fruit, and then we can begin preparations. 
Destroy 3 Legion Devastators.	Righteous Fury	The devastators bombarding our forces prevent us from advancing any further. I can only protect us from their blasts for so long. Champion, you must pierce their lines and remove the barriers protecting the devastators. If you can destroy the anchors that maintain the shields, I can cleanse them from afar. 
Meet Kalec at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.	Aluneth, Greatstaff of the Magna	Aluneth... a powerful and dangerous weapon. If tales are to be believed, Aluneth is actually the name of a very old and very powerful arcane entity, somehow bound to a staff through ancient magic. When Aegwynn relinquished Aluneth many years ago, it was entrusted to Kirin Tor, who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the blue dragonflight to secure away in secret. Only they would know exactly where it was taken. The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides on the Council of Six. 
	End of the Risen Threat	Commander Shadowsong sends word that he is prepared to face the late Lord Erdris. I have a letter from him for you. I'm prepared to teleport you to his location, but there's a snag. In order to combat the worst of the fel corruption, you will need to use some Nethershards on the way in. Make sure you have some before speaking with me. 
Defeat Nhal'athoth and collect his heart.	A Vessel Made Ready	After some consideration, I have decided to allow Alleria another opportunity to pursue her destiny. I suppose you want to know what that means, mortal.<Locus-Walker laughs.>Meet us deep in the Shadowguard camp ahead- my brethren are preparing a summons that will provide adequate energy for Windrunner to begin again. Witness what happens when you harness the Void's power. 
Travel to Destiny Point.	Storming the Citadel	We have already secured ground near Nath'raxas Hold. It is one of the Legion's chief military fortifications on Argus. Striking it now, and hard, may be our only opportunity to tip the scales in our favor. 
Locate Nightwatcher Idri in the Drowned Gardens.	Those Who Remember	The ghostly elves, to the south, once had the Pillar of Creation known as the Tidestone of Golganneth. Their great city of Nar'thalas was destroyed an eon ago. The city's ruler, Prince Farondis, fell with the city. You small ones die so easily. If anyone knows where the fragments rest, it will be the ghost of the prince. Seek out his people. 
Locate Arluin and persuade him to help you.	Hired Help	I was fond of Margaux. News of her death weighs heavily on many of us.<Vanthir shakes his head sadly.>If we are to carry on, we need to send a strong message. We need those like Durant to know that we are watching, and we will hold them accountable. I know someone who could help us. His name is Arluin. To call him a reluctant ally would be generously overstating it. He is cautious, and will not risk himself without compensation. You can find him in the alleys north of the Evermoon Bazaar. 
Collect the pieces of Yotnar's body from the Terrace of the Watchers.	The Shattered Watcher	When your adversary - the one called Skovald- completed his first trial, he used his ill-begotten powers to sunder my physical body. I cannot allow a contender to pass through the vault while I remain unwhole. His forces have no doubt scattered my pieces through the plateau which they currently desecrate. Bring them back to me, so that I may properly guide your trial. 
Complete the construction of the Nether Disruptor.	The Nether Disruptor	Well done George. In testament to the efforts of all forces fighting here, we have come together to complete the construction of the Nether Disruptor. All that remains is for you to inspect our work, and complete the construction. 
Gain entrance to the Violet Hold and interrogate Taldath the Destroyer to find out the location of the traitor Varedis.	By Any Means	We need to find out Varedis' location from the eredar inside this prison - the kind warden and his men here are all that stand in our way. We'll take them on together if need be - whatever it takes. 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran.	Paradise Lost	Archmage Khadgar was planning an expedition to Azsuna - you should seek him out at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran immediately. 
Place Energy Disruptors at the energy sources in Teloth'aran, Kel'balor and Elor'shan in Suramar.	I'll Just Leave This Here	Valtrois has a plan for the Sanctum's energy barrier. Several key Arcway locations throughout Suramar harness the power necessary for it. These Energy Disruptors she made will remotely break the links simultaneously on activation, causing the barrier to fall. Take these devices and install them at the leylines, then return here for the surprise assault on the Sanctum. 
Speak to Malfurion when ready.	The Emerald Queen	George, you have returned. Good. I have counseled with the other archdruids and concluded that Cenarius' condition is merely a symptom of a much greater problem. Your experiences in Moonclaw Vale make that clear. We need help. There is one who can bring understanding to these events. With Thaon gone, we must ask that you aid us in reaching out to the Lady of Dreams. 
Return 3 Wild Cragscalers to Lead Rider Jerek.	An Argus Roper	My warriors stand no chance against even the smallest of the Legion's forces without our Cragscalers. If you can capture a few and bring them here, my warriors can better defend our people. 
Take Okuna's Message to Lady Irisse.	Bottled Up	<You've found a message in a bottle on the corpse. It's a request for aid from someone named Okuna Longtusk. Okuna claims that he and his fellow shipmates are being held prisoner by sea giants. Maybe if you show the note to the ghost of Lady Irisse at the Crumbled Palace, she can point you in the right direction?> 
Reach Exalted with The Nightfallen.	Redemption for the Fallen	Soon the change of seasons will be upon us, and the Nightfallen will take command of their fate. You have given them hope, and set them on the path to redemption. They need you now more than ever. We all do. 
Meet Archmage Y'mera at the Conservatory of the Arcane.	Not-So-Humble Beginnings	Now we may begin our search for the Crown of the Triumvirate. We will start with the fragment Archimonde carried: the Sigil of Awakening. To the east and north you will find all that remains of the greatest school of magic on Argus. It was there that Archimonde gained his mastery of the arcane. I can think of no other place he would stow his treasures. It will be guarded, no doubt. We will leverage the expertise of Fareeya's forces here to follow this trail. 
Wake the Gatekeeper.	The Longest Vigil	It was a good thing we sought two sources of energy. Even with the conduits active, the construct has not stirred. It has likely been inactive a long while. Perhaps as long as Eredath has floated above Argus. What a long, lonely vigil it must have been.<Y'mera is silent for a moment as she peers at the construct.>Go ahead and jostle it a little. That combined with one last burst of magic ought to do the trick. 
	Black Rook Rumble	 
Fish up a Drowned Mana for Conjurer Margoss.	Drowned Mana	How did you end up out here? Ah well, that's neither here nor there at this point. What matters is that I need your help! I see you have some experience fishing. Think you could put that skill to use for me? 
Slay 6 Shardmaidens in the Shattered Locus.	The Shardmaidens	Long have I walked this land and I have seen many forms of corruption. The creatures that wander this hall are twisted by the magics unleashed by the failed arcan'dor. These dryads have lost their way, and cannot be saved. You must destroy them. End their suffering. 
Retrieve Lyana Darksorrow's glaives.	Glaive Circumstances	I came here on a mission to slay the demon eredar, Azoran. During my infiltration, I was shot down from my felbat and captured. I'm not going to mince words, George. Azoran plans to use the Burning Legion command ship to destroy Dalaran. To stop him, I will need my warglaives that were lost during my fall from the sky. I would retrieve them myself, but I'm still weakened from my imprisonment. Search for the warglaives on the northern side of the crater, where I was shot down. 
Meet Spiritwalker Ebonhorn at the southern bluff of Thunder Totem.	Secrets of Highmountain	Mayla's father, Ulan, was our last high chieftain. He was slain trying to stop the Underking from seizing the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. I have watched Mayla all her life and can tell you she has both the courage and the strength to wear the mantle of High Chieftain. She needs only our help to realize it herself. Will you meet us at the city entrance along the southern bluff? There is a ritual that might help, but we will need your aid to survive it. 
Search Jandvik for the vrykul mentioned in the scrolls.	Retribution: Fate of the Tideskorn	A scout from Stormheim arrived yesterday with a significant discovery - these ancient scrolls. Within they contain a Valkyra prophecy of a new vrykul ruler - one who could turn the Tideskorn against the Legion. It complicates matters that this vrykul may in fact be Skovald's heir. Take the scrolls, find the heir, and bring her to the Valkyra. I think the outcasts they refer to are the vrykul of Jandvik, so that would be a good place to start.|cFF660000Specialization: Retribution Paladin|r 
Kill Morphael.	Entangled Dreams	I sense powerful magic emanating from deep within the barrow. Whatever is down there weaves a powerful spell, entangling us within our dreams. I am still too weak, but your skills are quite impressive, hero. I can see why Malfurion puts his trust in you. Go and eliminate the source of this magic. 
Recruit Sylessa, Cyrille, and Lorin and slay Overseer Durant.	Make Your Mark	While you were out, I asked around. You are looking for Overseer Durant. Turns out he lives near the Shimmershade Garden. I can help you confront him, but you will need help. There are three individuals with the necessary skills, and they serve our cause. Tell Cyrille that the owl hoots at dusk. Inform Lorin that the saber prowls the plaza. Mention to Sylessa that the cruel caskmaster has breathed his last. They will know what to do. Speak to Vanthir when the deed is done. 
Help the Blackfeather ravenbears perform their tribute ritual.	Dances With Ravenbears	<The chieftain beckons for the ravenbears to gather the tribute and gestures toward the ritual circle outside.>Caw! Caw ca-caw!<It looks like he wants you to follow.> 
Join the Council of Six in the Purple Parlor above the Violet Citadel.	Away From Prying Eyes	Wars are not won solely with armies charging bravely across the battlefield, Mechanict. Sometimes, it is the actions of individuals that matter most, fighting battles few ever hear about. That is why - <Khadgar furrows his brow slightly.>We should really discuss this somewhere a tad more private. Let's move up to the Purple Parlor, shall we? 
""Herd"" 7 Lost Feathermane Kittens back home.	You've Got to Be Kitten Me Right Meow	While you were dealing with the stray Owlkitten, I took a look around. It seems these curious creatures have a habit of escaping their parents' watchful eyes - some are trapped across the road by a wandering Ettin. He appears to have been... ahem... eating them. We can earn Yowlon's blessing by bringing his children home. 
Return to the Vindicaar.	Shadow of the Triumvirate	Talgath's words carry more gravity than I think he knew. In an attempt to hurt me one final time, he has given us the answer. The Crest of Knowledge is hidden away in the Seat of the Triumvirate, and it is not unguarded. If my suspicions are correct, we may be facing a greater threat than any of us dared imagine. A dark naaru. Let us return to the Vindicaar. We will plan our next steps there. 
Meet with Ly'leth Lunastre outside the Twilight Vineyards.	Make an Entrance	I need you to infiltrate the Twilight Vineyards and bring back something to deal with these insects. To do that, you will need a way to bypass the guards that keep the orchards secure. Ly'leth will be able to help us there. I will arrange to have her meet you near the entrance. Go quickly! 
Seal off the Arcway Outlets in Lunastre Lane, The Parade Grounds, and the Midnight Court.	Flow Control	If all goes as planned, the manastorm will cause the leyline to flare up, sending a great surge of energy through the arcway. In order for the surge to reach Shal'Aran, we must seal off any outlets along the way. If we miss even one, the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the energy blow off. Thalyssra had better be sure about this tree. 
Speak with Archmage Khadgar at the Azurewing Repose.	Journey to the Repose	For now, the Illidari can hold the line against the Legion. We will return later to help them drive the Legion from the upper reaches of Faronaar. You and I must concentrate on the Pillars of Creation if the Tomb of Sargeras is to be resealed. Your saving of Stellagosa is fortuitous. Surely if anyone knows where a Pillar of Creation is, it will be her grandfather, Senegos. The Azurewing Repose is to the northeast. I will meet you there, George. 
Call down a Lightforged Beacon.	The Path Forward	<Velen stares beyond the arena for a time.>We must continue on, but I feel Eredath is far from finished with us. We should take advantage of this relative safety while we still can. I will place a signal beacon that will allow the Vindicaar to lock onto our location. Romuul will send us our means of returning to the Vindicaar if there is a need. 
Speak to Yotnar to receive the blessing of the watchers.	The Blessing of the Watchers	As is your due for passing the Trial of Might, I will grant you the blessing of the watchers. Furthermore, to aid you in your trials to come, I will bestow upon your artifact the power of the vault's keeper. May it serve you well in your time of need. Speak to me when you are ready to receive this gift. 
Take Danath's spare mount to the Broken Shore and provide assistance.	Return to the Broken Shore	If I'm to assist in this war, I need firsthand information. I will fly to the Broken Shore and see the battlefield for myself. Your record as a proven commander is unquestioned, and you were there. I could use your insight. Will you accompany me to the Broken Shore? I don't anticipate engaging the enemy, but that close to the Fel Storm, one can never be sure. 
Use the Stormforged Horn to destroy the three Felbound Portals in Gates of Valor.	Stem the Tide	Skovald has profaned the Gates of Valor with his demonic allies. Among his forces his twisted mystics have conjured portals to ferry his fel allies from their blighted worlds. If we wish to stem this tide, these portals must be destroyed. I will gather my allies. Take this horn and signal when you have found a portal, and we will strike from the skies! 
Taste the Honeyed Infusion, Supple Nectar, and Unctuous Draught.	The Fruit of Our Efforts	It is my job to maintain appearances here.<Margaux smiles apologetically.>You will have to endure a little showmanship while I walk with you through the vineyard. It is the only way to avoid suspicion. I will try to help you as I can, but only when it is safe to do so. Come with me- our first stop is the tasting pavilion. There you can sample some of our work. 
Defeat Archimonde and retrieve the Sigil of Awakening.	The Defiler's Legacy	It seems you are not so easily deterred. Very well. Your deeds qualify you to seek the Sigil. To be clear, I am only permitting you to move on. This does not guarantee your success. The greatest of your challenges lies before you. You must go to the Praetorium and face Archimonde himself. Only by defeating the master of the Conservatory will you be worthy of the Sigil. Few have overcome this obstacle. I hope he does not make too much of a mess of you. 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	Continuing the Cure	Given the events at the Waning Crescent, the refugees here are more eager than ever to receive the gift of the arcan'dor and be free of the Nightwell forever. Fortunately, the tree has borne more fruit. Again, I ask that you honor us by giving this fruit to anyone here in Shal'Aran. When you are finished, we shall discuss further developments within the city. Silgryn reports that Arluelle has proven a fine student, and the two are making progress in evacuating citizens. 
Take the Death Gate to the Frozen Throne, and receive the Mark of the Lich King.	The Call of Vengeance	I was wrong about you, death knight. Your assistance against the Dark Riders has proven a great service to the Light. Perhaps I should not be so quick to judge. Nevertheless, you have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners. As for Apocalypse, I can think of no safer place than in your care. May it serve you well against the Legion, death knight. 
	Inquisitor Ernstenbok	 
Obtain 300 Ancient Mana from Suramar	Cubic Currents	To determine this cube's purpose, we need to power it up. Hmm, I have an idea...The Nightborne covet a substance you are no doubt familiar with called ancient mana. Should be just the thing for a relic this old. Gather a sufficient quantity and we'll attempt to get it working. Be careful in Suramar! It would be a shame if this curious cube were lost and became a memory once more. 
	Fight Night: Rats!	 
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.	The Advisor and the Arcanist	This new First Arcanist appointed by Elisande. This... Andaris. If she is as dangerous as I have heard, then Ly'leth may well be lost. I am sorry, I should not entertain such thoughts. It is just that we have received a troubling message. Help me distribute the latest batch of the arcan'dor fruit, then we will discuss the message. 
Speak to Kayn Sunfury at Krasus' Landing.	Call of the Illidari	George, Kayn requests that you meet him at Krasus' Landing at once.<Kor'vas leans in close, her voice an urgent whisper.>You must hurry. The Legion has eyes everywhere. 
Witness Thunderaan.	Audience with the Windlord	I have kept my promise. Thunderaan the Windlord awaits. Know that if betrayal is in your heart, the Windlord will not be deceived. Be silent, and perhaps your audience shall be a fortunate one. 
Slay Magula.	Death to the Witchmother	The numberless years of my life have been dedicated to learning and perfecting the arts of healing and restoration. Nothing in this world pains me more than taking a life, traveler. It is with a heavy heart that I must commission the death of Magula, the leader of the harpies that threaten this grove. May her death save the lives of more noble beings. 
Attend the secret meeting at Faol's Rest in Tirisfal Glades.	Priestly Matters	<Master/Mistress> George, I come at the behest of one who seeks to organize a stronger resistance to the Legion threat. If you would meet him at Faol's Rest in Tirisfal Glades, he will guarantee both your safety and an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the conflict. 
	Legion 110 A	 
	WANTED: Skul'vrax	 
Bring the Waterlogged Tome to Robert Newhearth in Dalaran.	Waterlogged Tome	In spite of its magical nature, the book has been damaged by water. The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his abilities. Perhaps he can restore it. 
Carry Chief Telemancer Oculeth to Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Close Enough	<Oculeth's eyes have dulled. His voice trembles.>Are we... are we close? So hungry... 
Defeat Runeseer Faljar in Haustvald.	The Final Judgment	In my fragmented state, I captured glimpses of a hero meting out justice to the corrupted mystics of Haustvald. I see now, this hero was you, Mechanic. I know you seek my judgment, but my spirit is still fragmented. As we speak, Runeseer Faljar is calling upon dark, forbidden magics in an attempt to banish my spirit to Helheim. If he succeeds, your trial will be lost. My connection here is fading. Go, there is little time! 
Fly with Aeosera to Needlerock Spire and defeat Borlock of the Deeps.	Needlerock Beatdown	The troggs saw where your hammer fell, and I expect those cowards told the Legion where to find it. Hmph! The leader of the stone troggs since the Cataclysm has been ""Borlock,"" a thick-headed little dirt-grubber who's about to get what's coming to him. Find him at Needlerock Spire and beat the information out of him. Take Aeosera with you. Her and her brood have their own score to settle with those belligerent little beasts. 
	A Spy in Our Midst	 
Use the Lightforged Warframe to take control of the Court of the Avenger.	Dawn of Justice	Thanks to your efforts, our enemy is in disarray and their defenses inoperable. We must take the ground at the spire's base and tighten the noose around their commander's neck. You have more than earned the honor to take the warframe into battle. We will follow your lead once the way is clear. 
Deliver plans to Vereesa Windrunner, Lady Liadrin and Tyrande Whisperwind.	Ready for Battle	Thanks to your efforts and a lot of effort on the part of our new army, the Nightfallen are prepared for battle. What is more, we have managed to evacuate nearly all of the civilians between here and Astravar Harbor. I have drafted plans that can lead our combined forces through the city and take the harbor. Can you deliver these plans to Vereesa, Tyrande and Liadrin? 
Lead the elven army to Astravar Harbor.	Full Might of the Elves	Thalyssra managed to get all 3 to agree to the same thing? I am impressed with her skills of negotiation. Alright hero, Liadrin is already marching on Suramar. Join her forces. Tyrande will flank the city defenders and meet you deeper in. The Nightborne will bring up the rear and hold the territory for us. Oculeth and I will move the Kirin Tor forces to Astravar Harbor. With luck, we shall see you on the other side. 
	Not On My Watch	 
Find Kor'vas Bloodthorn in the streets of Dalaran.	Guardian: Aid of the Illidari	Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city. Kor'vas Bloodthorn of the Illidari has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks. I do not entirely trust these 'demon hunters', but they have at least proved adept at their namesake. I suggest you find her and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.|cFF660000Specialization: Guardian Druid|r 
Meet with Li Li in Ramkahen.	Off To Adventure!	Oh I'd love to go see if that story is true! But Pops is too busy stuffing his gut and being a grouch to let me go do any real exploring. He even told me that I can't leave the village unless I have a guardian! Is Pops for real? I can protect myself just fine! Say, would you be my guardian? Please, get me away from this boredom and you will totally be my hero! 
Celebrate the successful acquistion of your artifact with your fellow Shadows.	Honoring Success	All has gone as planned. Your new blades are a testament to that. We will demand a great deal of you in the weeks and months to come, as we must. But we would be remiss if we failed to take a moment to celebrate a job well done. What do you say? 
Dispel 5 Void Manifestations.	The Pulsing Madness	This broken still retains some of his sanity, though not all of it. I can sense some Void influence nearby, but it is isolated to small pockets. Dispelling these manifestations should help our friend here clear his mind. Perhaps we can use the prayer fragments you found, as they still contain some Light energy. I will try and make sense of his chattering in the meantime. Maybe we can learn something about what is happening here. 
Deactivate 5 Void Harvesters.	Sources of Darkness	I think I understand what he was trying to show us, George. I feel a surge of power building ahead. They must be cultivating the Void, calling it here. We need to stop them before they plunge this entire city into shadow. Find the source and cut it off by any means necessary. Locus-Walker and I have unfinished business to attend to. 
Locate Mythandros and Redhoof the Ancient.	Redhoof the Ancient	While you were busy assisting the Owlcats across the river, Mythandros and Solendra ventured further to the east. I believe Mythandros may have found the next creature that may offer us its blessing. There is a secluded glade along the river's bend to the Northeast. There you may find our new ally, an elderly stag named Redhoof. 
Speak to Aranelle in Lorlathil.	Nature's Call	What vile power is this?!A curse with the strength to paralyze a demigod? Unimaginable! Quickly, George, you must gather the archdruids of the forest. With their help, we can summon Ysera. She will surely know what horror has overtaken my mentor. I will remain here and lend Cenarius what aid I can. Return to Lorlathil and speak with Aranelle. She will know the archdruids' whereabouts. And please, friend, make haste... 
Speak to Lead Rider Jerek in the Petrified Forest.	The Wranglers	Great evil exists on Argus and our forests house some of the worst of it. My wranglers are at the edge of the forest and are waiting for reinforcements. That would be you. Seek out Lead Rider Jerek, he will tell you more. 
Return to Thalyssra.	Friends With Benefits	The Lunastre Attendant, silent as ever, offers you a wax-sealed scroll. It reads:""Dearest George,I asked my attendant to catch you, should things go in my favor. The role of Advisor will keep me away from the estate for some time and I settled on a gift for Thalyssra. I have sent a detachment of attendants to Shal'Aran with some comfort items. Treat them well- they need someone to wait on and I could think of none better! Give the others my thanks, and my love,Advisor Ly'leth Lunastre"" 
Find Brambley Morrison.	Search and Rescue!	We've got to find Brambley before it's too late! Ol' Brambley an' I have been fightin' side by side since the Third War. When the Burnin' Legion invaded, we didn't think twice about coming to the Broken Isles. Fightin' is what we do best! During the battle ol' Brambley got caught too deep an' got himself captured. Now we've got to rescue him! Last I saw, the demons were keeping him in a prison cell not far from here... let's go! 
Travel to Xylem's Tower within Bear's Head in Azshara.	Havoc: The Thieving Apprentice	The Focusing Iris has been stolen from the Dalaran Vaults! The thief was a mage of some skill, but we've been unable to track him. Fortunately, the thief dropped a note from his master, addressing him as one of his ""apprentici."" I know of only one mage who uses that particular pluralization - Archmage Xylem. I'll need you to investigate. In Azshara you will find his tower where he trains his apprentices. Go there, and see what Xylem is up to.|cFF660000Specialization: Havoc Demon Hunter|r 
Enter the Void Tear and deal with Arkhaan.	Arkhaan's Peril	Whatever called to him, it cannot have good intentions. We need to go in after him. Before we step through this portal, George... ensure you are prepared to fight. The Void's influence is rarely peaceful. 
Kill Irewing after sending up a flare, signaling his location.	Scout It Out	You've proven that a gnome can shoot a rifle, and that's no easy feat, but a true test of Addie's skill will be to see if she can track down an elusive beast. Rumor has it that a ravenous roc circles the basin, cursed by harpy magic, but no one's seen the beast up close. Take this flare, and shoot it into the sky once you've spotted the roc. When we see the signal, the huntin' party will rush in and help bring down that magnificent bird! 
Destroy the siege weapon at the Crown of Destruction.	Vengeance	The Army of the Light will not have fallen in vain. Our forces will assault the main encampment while we destroy their siege weapon. This will be but the beginning of our vengeance. 
Use the Dusk Lily Sigil on Duskwatch Subjugators to identify 5 Deserters.	More Like Me	Greetings, Outlander. I am Victoire. I served Elisande while she maintained peace in the city. I fought beside demons and worse for the greater good. The massacre at the Waning Crescent made it clear that she no longer serves the Nightborne. She serves only herself. There are others who feel as I do. They simply need proof that there is another way. The Dusk Lily is not unknown to us- try showing it to those now guarding Astravar Harbor. They have seen the worst of Elisande's cruelty. 
Meet Andaris at the Lunastre Estate in Suramar City.	A Challenge From Our Enemies	Make no mistake. This message cannot be taken lightly. Any threat made against our people will be dealt with swiftly. We must travel to the estate at once to discover what has become of Ly'leth. 
Return to Turalyon on the Vindicaar.	Dire News	Azeroth was right in sendin' us here, George. We have to stop whatever it is Sargeras is plannin', or we may not have a home left to save when this is all over. Ye should go back to Turalyon and let him know what ye've seen. I'll stay here and see if I can't glean anything else that might help us. 
Read the Sealed Letter and follow the instructions within.	Call of The Uncrowned	My masters gave me strict instructions to deliver this letter to you as quickly as possible. Its contents are for you and you alone. Good luck. 
Recover 3 Weapon Caches at Black Rook Hold in Val'sharah.	We Need Weapons	So many of the rebels want to help in the coming battle. Our people have the will, they lack only the means. They need weapons. From what Khadgar has told me, the fortress of Black Rook has plenty of munitions we could use. Travel to the fortress and place these beacons on some weapon caches there. Once placed, I can teleport them back. 
	Clear the Skies	 
Start your search for the Deadwind Harvester at Manor Mistmantle in Duskwood.	Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester	The book says the Dark Riders were last seen in a place called Manor Mistmantle. If friend can find these riders, then <he/she> can get Ulthalesh! Calydus will wait here and await your return. Find Ulthalesh, friend! 
Search among the caged vrykul in Helheim for one who can help your escape.	An Unworthy Task	This place is Helheim, the realm of the unworthy dead. Here, the spirits of the dishonorable spend eternity in an endless futile battle, always seeking glory but never able to attain it. We should not be here. We must find a way out. I will scout ahead - you should try and release some of these captive spirits here. Perhaps one may have some answers for us. 
Collect 5 Crystallized Bark.	Fragments of Disaster	In the hall beyond rests the bones of the failed arcan'dor. I will take fragments of the crystallized tree and attempt to read them. We must discover the root cause of this destruction. Only then do we have any hope of preventing this disaster from repeating itself. 
Deliver 1,362 pieces of solid stone to the Ethereal Portal in Dalaran.	A Huge Package	Due to the incredible volume of complaints in recent months we have been barred from delivering s... s...<The Postmaster holds back tears, pain visible in his eyes.>Solid stone. We're positively swimming in it - if we can't deliver it then pretty soon we will be overwh-<The Postmaster's eyes light up suddenly.>That's it! There is an old Consortium portal not far from here that we could deposit it in with none the wiser! Can you help, George? The stone is extraordinarily heavy. 
Collect Steelscale's Fin from Steelscale in Citrine Bay.	Put It All on Red	All right, I've got one last beasty to send you after. He's a bit far out, but trust me, it'll be worth it. This one I put a huge wager on! Along the eastern coast swims a great shark the locals call Steelscale. They say his hide is near impenetrable. But you're gonna prove them wrong, aren't ya chum? Bring me his fin, and those tauren will have to fork over a princely sum. 
Slay 15 withered in Azurewing Repose.	Feasting on the Dragon	You killed their leader, so they came here? Understandable. These creatures crave only one thing - magic - and they can sniff it out from leagues away. Without a leader, they will soon wither and die. Our only recourse in the meantime is to put as many as possible down before they take these dragons with them! 
	Direbeak Swarm!	 
	Horde Kill Squad (Alliance Only)	 
Dismantle 3 Spires of Woe.	Dark Machinations	Eredar are adept at manipulating the fel that courses through this world. Those who do not shape it into living weapons build other armaments, like the Spires of Woe. The spires will make it difficult for even a small force to penetrate the main stronghold. We must dismantle enough of them to clear the way before we advance upon it. 
Meet Turalyon in the Krokul Hovel.	Gathering Light	Alleria and I long for more time with our son, but we cannot afford to wait any longer, George. We must strike now. The Army of the Light is scattered, but not defeated. Any survivors should have stayed near the crash site of the Xenedar. If there is any hope of victory, we must rally them and rescue Xe'ra. With the pit lords dealt with, we should have a safer route to the Xenedar. Meet me in the krokul hovel as soon as you can. 
Select an artifact weapon to pursue.	A Pact of Necessity	We have an unexpected ally in this war, George, and we're going to need every advantage we can get to defeat the Burning Legion. The Ebon Blade will serve as the Lich King's arm as long as the Scourge is confined to Northrend. In return for our assistance, our ally has offered to assist in obtaining powerful weapons for the strongest of our knights. Weapons powerful enough to end the Legion once and for all! You are one of our best, George. I want you to decide which weapon you would like to seek out. 
Follow Orathiss through Falanaar Tunnels and slay her.	The Hidden City	Orathiss has underestimated the seed. It is sapping her power - slowing her down. We must catch her and get the seed to safety! 
Slay Aggonar.	A Strike at the Heart	These pits have long been a blight upon the lives of our new allies. The demons hunt them down and torture the poor souls for sport.<Turalyon shakes his head with disgust, fixing his gaze upon the beast before him.>It is time to make them pay for their cruelty and restore hope to this Light-forsaken place. We strike on your mark, George. 
Collect 6 Arcane-Infused Eggs.	The Magister of Mixology	As you must know, I'm a connoisseur of drinks... specifically, arcane-infused spirits. Cocktail mixing is alchemy, and as everyone knows, alchemy is magic. My latest drink must be more exotic than anything I've conjured before. I already have most of what I need. But there are a couple of items left on the list. Notice the herons down in the lagoon? As with many of the creatures on Azsuna, the magic coursing through the island permeates them. Their eggs will do nicely. 
Obtain the Twinblades of the Deceiver from Varedis Felsoul in Suramar.	The Hunt	You must lead this hunt, George - a small force will join you to ensure Varedis meets his end. You must try to make it into Varedis' hold undetected; the less time you spend in Legion territory the better. Meet at Krasus' Landing when you are prepared to leave. 
	Flow of the Nightmare	 
Find Malfurion Stormrage.	The Demon's Trail	Malfurion is nearby. I can sense him..Search the summit of Andu'talah while I continue to scour the forest. Be swift, George. Time is of the essence! 
Seek out Thorim at the Temple of Storms and recover Titanstrike.	Never Hunt Alone	Prustaga is almost certainly on her way to the Temple of Storms, which is where I imbued Titanstrike with the Thunderspark. If my deductions are correct, she'll attempt to reverse the process and infuse the spark into herself, thus attaining the godlike power she craves! Hopefully Thorim isn't off cavorting with his hounds again. If Prustaga has the local vrykul on her side, things may get... complicated. 
Recover 5 Books of Tactics from Black Rook Hold in Val'sharah.	Learning From the Dead	I heard you were traveling to Black Rook Hold. It was once home to the legendary Lord Ravencrest, a brilliant tactician. His knowledge may be exactly what we need to give us an edge against the Duskwatch. While you are at the Rook, keep your eyes peeled for any books that might have survived the ages that outline the Ravencrest's strategems. 
Kill 10 Duskpelt worg in Amberfall Mesa.	Eating Into Our Business	Greetings traveler! You are welcome to rest at our camp, but if you plan on sticking around a while, I have a proposition for you. As you can see, the land here has been very good to us, providing a great natural bounty. Lately, however, the worg have become problematic, and are thinning the herds to unacceptable levels. I can't take care of them all, so I will offer a bounty for every worg slain in the mesa. Return to me when you have culled their pack a bit. 
Find and rescue the mother of the Thorignir brood.	Heart of a Dragon	Through brute force and corruption, the God-King has taken the power you seek, but there may be hope for you and the Thorignir, Mechanic. With the aid of fel powers such as I've never seen, the Felskorn are corrupting our young and seeking to enslave the Thorignir. Their leader, a demon of great power, has captured our mother and seeks to bend her to the God-King's will. Find her and free her from the demon's grasp - only then might the Thorignir regain our power and grant you aid. 
Speak with Mayla Highmountain at Thunder Totem.	Unexpected Allies	You have gained my trust. Not all drogbar are as violent as the savages led by Dargrul the Underking, nor are all tauren as bloodthirsty as the Bloodtotem. You may tell Mayla Highmountain that she has our support. The cavern we call home is yours to explore freely as well, George. 
Choose a second artifact to pursue.	A Second Weapon	We have strong leads on other ancient weapons that you might choose to pursue, if having one renowned, powerful piece of history in your hands is somehow insufficient. I'll lay out the options for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. 
	Ashbringer Chosen	 
	Varga	 
Complete a Greater Invasion Point scenario.	Commander's Downfall	A champion of the Legion is vulnerable within an invasion point! Track it down and destroy it before it can return to fight on Argus. 
Infiltrate Shipwreck Arena and find Okuna Longtusk.	Infiltrating Shipwreck Arena	The giants at Shipwreck Arena are very fond of smashing ships that sail too close to shore. They take the sailors prisoner and use them for their own amusement. I suppose it will be easy for you to infiltrate the place. It's breaking out that will be the difficult part. 
Activate the Sacred Stone to witness Argus' vision with Magni.	Visions of Torment	I've been hearin' whispers ever since we got to Argus. They're just like Azeroth's, only... they ain't hers. I'm convinced that Argus has a titan of its own that's reachin' out to us! The broken have a relic stowed away that's darn near holy to 'em. Hatuun says they hear whispers from it... I think it might have some sort o' link to Argus itself! It's just in this chamber. Let's see what we can learn. 
Meet Orik Trueheart on Shield Hill in Howling Fjord.	To Northrend	Naturally I've done some legwork already. I believe this Gorvold is buried at Shield Hill in the Howling Fjord. Tahu can help locate the grave, and with a short ritual we should have our answers! Meet us at Shield Hill in the Howling Fjord and we'll move on to the next step. 
Take the Captain's Log to Advisor Stillwater at the Windrunner's Sanctuary on Dalaran.	Fate of the Queen's Reprisal	<This is the kind of intelligence that should be shared. Perhaps someone at the Windrunner's Sanctuary on Dalaran will know what to do with it.> 
Speak with Thrall and choose the Artifact you wish to pursue.	The Elements Call...	Nobundo is right. Conventional tactics will not work against the Legion - the Broken Shore taught us that. We must scour the world for weapons to use against the Legion! The Doomhammer is missing and must be recovered. Rehgar and Erunak have some other ideas, as well. Whatever our course, we must act immediately. Speak with me to go over your options, but the final decision is yours! 
Find Garona Halforcen outside Stormwind.	Preparation	<With Althea's escape there is only one place to go: Stormwind.><If Garona is keeping a similar pace on the cult's trail, she's bound to be making preparations to enter the city herself.><Finding her is paramount before moving into the city.> 
Collect the Giants' Stash of Weapons.	Let Sleeping Giants Lie	We're going to need a diversion to get close to Prince Oceanus. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? See Sleepy Dhow over there? He's guarding all of the weapons the giants take from our shipwrecks. We can use those weapons to arm the rest of the pit fighters that are held in the caves. All you have to do is get past that giant without waking him. 
Return 9 Rejected Letters.	Return to Sender	You've arrived just in time! Unlike the mail as of late, I'm afraid. We are severely understaffed, and demand is at an all-time high. We simply can't keep up! I'd love to chat, but I need help catching up before I can rest for even a moment. First thing's first. Several parcels of rejected mail have broken loose again; will you help me round them all up and return them to their senders? 
Meet with Genn Greymane at Stormwind Keep.	Summons to the Keep	Greetings, George. Your presence has been requested in the royal court. The crown has urgent need of you! Please return to Stormwind at your earliest convenience. King Greymane is anticipating your swift arrival. 
?????	Do The Thing!	Mrglrg! Mrlglr mrgllrg.<Phin gesticulates wildly>Mrlgrlg glrglmglr mrlglrg. Rglrgmrg mrglr glr. Glr! Gmrlgrmlg mrglmrgm...<Phin looks at you expectantly.> 
	Tools of the Trade	I used to visit here before the barrier was raised. While the ruling council and the Grand Magistrix argued and politicked I watched the caretakers perform their rituals and venerate the dead. I would honor the spirits here one last time. I am headed to the tombs. If some of the sacred oils, burial shrouds, or incense survived the ages then bring them to me. 
Follow the lamp posts to take Iadreth to Astoril.	A Desperate Journey	The city's entrances are under heavy guard. He must have another way. Thanks to this wine I am strong enough to make the journey to him. I fear that I will not be able to defend or run if I come under attack. You will accompany me, Human. You and this Astoril are my only chance at surviving now. I remember when I was leaving the city that there were lamps guiding me here. We should be able to retrace our steps by following them. 
Slay High Crawliac, the Witchqueen.	The Witchqueen	The time has come to assault High Crawliac, the Witchqueen. You should know that one does not become queen of the harpies through kindness. This creature has killed, betrayed, and tormented countless tauren, harpies, kobolds, and anything else she had to in order to secure her position as queen. Come, friend, let us finish this. 
Use Therazane's Portal to travel to the Crumbling Depths. Accompany Stormcaller Mylra and Thrall to recover the Doomhammer.	The Hammer in the Deep	<Thrall listens intently.>You found it! The Doomhammer fell to the Crumbling Depths... But the Legion remains a step ahead of us. If we hurry, we can follow the demon Geth'xun and retrieve the hammer before any more of this realm is corrupted. Therazane will open a portal directly there. Let's go! 
Complete the summoning ritual with the Council of the Black Harvest in the Circle of Wills in Dalaran.	The New Blood	It is time to begin the ritual, warlock. Be prepared, for the summoning we perform today will be more challenging than any you have known or seen before. Are you ready? 
Slay 8 Forsaken Bat-Riders or Forsaken Deathstalkers.	Boarded!	Glad to see you survived the crash. Unfortunately, so did most of the enemy's boarding party. Just the thought of those monsters setting foot on my ship makes me sick. Wipe them out, $p. For my crew... For King Wrynn...For the Alliance! 
Speak with Mayla Highmountain at Thunder Totem.	The High Chieftain	I understand what Ebonhorn has been trying to tell me for a while now. Our people do not need a hammer, we need a leader. One willing to stand against any threat, even if they are terrified to do so. And between you and me, I am definitely terrified, but resolved. Let us return to Thunder Totem and prepare ourselves for war. 
Offer Arcwine to suffering citizens.	Dispensing Compassion	There is much you need to learn about our city. First and foremost, Arcwine. It is the vehicle by which we imbibe the Nightwell's energies. Without it, we wither and die. Palace lackeys have seen fit to ration it, thinking this will control us. Keep us quiet, complacent. I would like you to look for those in need near the tavern. You will find many, but those most desperately afflicted by this rationing will be obvious. Take this flask. Revive them. Tend to their suffering. 
Infuse the Essence of Shadow into the Netherlight Crucible.	An Offering of Shadow	Can you sense it, George? The darkness within this essence is palpable. In the past, I might have shunned such power, even denied its very existence. But what have we learned throughout our long struggle, if not that Light and shadow must coexist? This may prove to be exactly what we need to bring balance to the Netherlight Crucible. To give us the edge we need against the Legion. Infuse this essence into the crucible, champion. Draw one step closer to realizing your weapon's full potential. 
	The Brood of Nithogg	 
Plant rumors among members of House Duskmere.	Rumor Has It	Coryn Stelleris and Ruven Duskmere were close friends, but one always overshadowed the other. Now the Stelleris family stands to gain from lord Ruven's death. Handsomely. House Duskmere will soon learn of their loss. I want you to be the one to redirect their anger and grief. A handful of well placed rumors should do the trick. I won't be lingering in this part of the city for long, and Ly'leth will want to know of your efforts. Return to her when you are finished. 
Trap 8 demon souls on the Faronaar Front.	Demon Souls	I need to extract information about the Burning Legion from these foul creatures. But living, the demons are almost impossible to break. However, like you, I wield a powerful artifact -- the Scythe of Souls. Take one of my soul gems. If you place it next to a demon's corpse, it will rip the 'soul' out. Then, we will see if the scythe can get them to talk. 
Start your search for Apocalypse at Manor Mistmantle in Duskwood.	Apocalypse	<The Lich King's chill voice fills your mind once again>There is an ancient blade, lost in the echoes of time, that has the power to bring my vengeance upon the Legion. It is known as Apocalypse. I've sensed the blade in the possession of the Dark Riders of Deadwind Pass. Their magic conceals them from my sight but they cannot hide from the scourge! They were last seen by my agents near a place called Manor Mistmantle. Go there, George. Defeat the Dark Riders, and claim the blade! 
Have Battlelord Gaardoun show you what your forces obtained.	Spoils of Victory	The Fel Hammer will be a fine home for our kind, but it is what we found within its depths that is the true prize of our conquest. Battlelord Gaardoun and his Ashtongue have it closely guarded - you should have him show you. 
Use the Appendix of Azerothian Artifacts to choose an artifact to pursue.	A Mage's Weapon	It is decided, then. The foundation of the Tirisgarde's strength lies in the ancient artifacts wielded by its champions. Your first task will be to retrieve one such artifact. The master appendix of this library lists every artifact known to the Council of Tirisfal. There should be a few choices in there worth looking into. I will leave it to you to choose which to pursue. 
Rescue Vanthir and give him an Arcan'dor fruit.	Waxing Crescent	His captor is familiar to me. He is one of Aluriel's lieutenants and a skilled spell-fencer at that. You will need Silgryn's help to retrieve the key to Vanthir's prison. Our friend's life hangs in the balance. Even if we manage to wrestle him from the executioner's grasp, he may well Wither before we can act. I need you to take an Arcan'dor fruit to him. They are precious, and few, but for Vanthir this is the only chance he has. Go quickly, and good luck. 
Kill Araxxas and collect the Prison Keys.	Black Rook Prison	I did not come this far to lose her in the final moments. Maiev must be in the cells beneath Black Rook Hold. I scouted above, and the entrance to the prison is guarded by a fearsome jailor. I will sneak past and take out the guards inside. Defeat Araxxas, take the keys, and then meet me within. 
Locate Velen.	A Non-Prophet Organization	I have complete faith that Velen is nearby. We would know if he had been captured. All the same, we must not delay. The Legion has a vested interest in finding him after all he has done to resist them. I shudder to think what they might do, given the chance. That is why I am going with you. We will find Velen and help him track down the Crest of Knowledge. We must have faith in his mission or all will be lost. 
Speak with Stellagosa to ride back to Shal'Aran.	A Dance With Dragons	I must say I am impressed, George. You and your friend were able to fix a ley line, and you are not even dragons! You both seem exhausted by this ordeal. Allow me to help you get back home. 
	Life Finds a Way	 
Capture the Horizon's Edge and obtain the Dreadblades.	The Dreadblades	I can promise ya a safe journey to Eliza's position, but once we're there... well, we both know there be no guarantees. The plan is simple. We'll take the Crimson Veil as close as we can get her without being seen and disembark from there. Once we're ashore, we'll board the Horizon's Edge, bribe her mutinous crew to hand it over, and hunt down Eliza and her legendary blades wherever she may be. Just say the word when yer ready. 
Gather the Telemancy Notes and 4 Discarded Orbs from Oculeth's Test Chamber.	Experimental Instability	In order to advance our studies I must ask you to recover a few particular items from my long-forgotten chambers. I assure you it is... mostly safe there, aside from a few unstable elements. Make your way to my workshop and locate the teleporter. I'll disable its cloaking device when you arrive. 
Slay Kar'aaz, Xeth'tal, and Magraloth in the Annihilan Pits.	Threat Reduction	In time, Hatuun and his people will set aside their bitterness and become valuable allies. But their trust must be earned. He says their village is beset by a demon called Aggonar and his cruel kin. We need these fiends out of the way before we can seek out Alleria and the others. The chieftain lent us his horn. Use it to call down his people's vengeance upon the demon lieutenants while I carve a path to Aggonar's lair. 
	Jarrun's Ladder	 
Obtain keys from the Violetsail pirates along the west coast of the Eye of Azshara. Then set the captured pets free.	Paw Patrol	While Speedy IV was collecting supplies, Stringfellowe was scouting the rest of the Eye of Azshara. Turns out there is a whole mess of pirates to the west. That must be where the pets are at. Head over there and rescue the pets. 
Select a weapon to pursue.	A Worthy Blade	For quite some time, we've been looking for someone who can operate outside these halls. George, you are the answer to that search. You will be the blade in the dark that vanquishes our foes. In order to do so, you require weapons capable of striking down the Legion's best. Greymane, Tethys, and Valeera each have devised plans to obtain weapons worthy of the tasks to come. I suggest you hear each out before proceeding. 
Meet up with Nightwatcher Idri at the Crumbled Palace.	Prince Farondis	I'm glad to see that my doubts in you were unfounded. You seek Prince Farondis? Follow me. I will show you to the prince's hall. 
Speak to Archmage Khadgar on Krasus' Landing in Dalaran.	The Tranquil Forest	Archmage Khadgar sent word about Val'sharah not long ago. It sounds like he has good news. You should meet him on Krasus' Landing in Dalaran as soon as you are able. 
Slay 15 Shadowguard Ethereals.	The Shadowguard Incursion	As you have surely gathered by now, a certain subset of my people have tragically succumbed to the call of the Void. I had hoped to find more who possess the necessary strength of mind. I am disappointed to find such an utter lack of resistance. It cannot be helped. To advance your cause, and mine, we will need to eradicate these weak-willed beings. 
Recover Tirion Fordring and the Ashbringer from the Broken Shore.	The Search for the Highlord	Tirion is fading away on that infernal shore... and the Ashbringer with him! We must not waste another moment. Give the word and we'll set off. We're ready when you are. 
Collect an Immaculate Felcore.	A Touch of Fel	Our warframe is almost operational! It just needs a good jolt to revitalize its systems. Warlocks in the pools below infuse pieces of Argus with fel energy to create living siege weapons. If you can extract one, we can use it to jumpstart the warframe's Judgment Core! 
Enter the Grand Promenade and slay 15 defenders.	Down to Business	First things first, George: we must set up our camp. We do not have the time or resources for a prolonged siege. It is not like we can starve them out. No, we must be swift and sure as an arrow, piercing their heart in one strike. They are drawing up their battle lines within the city, but could attack us while we are setting up our defenses. Venture forth and show them what the kaldorei have learned from thousands of years of war. Discover their weaknesses so that we may exploit them. 
Glide to Illidari Redoubt off of Krasus' Landing.	Eternal Vigil	<Kor'vas glances at your glaives, her eyes widening.>I'm excited to see what those can do in person! Maybe we can spar a bit before heading out on the next hunt? While you were gone we built a camp just off of this landing to help us watch over the Legion's movements. We should head there right away - Jace needed your help with something. It sounded big! 
Raise 6 Champions to 950 Item Level.	Take the Edge Off	The demons streaming out of Antorus equip themselves at Felfire Armory. We need to deny those weapons. Will your Mechanics fight alongside the Army of the Light once again? Before the assault, gather materials. My smiths will craft your soldiers more powerful armor. The Legion won't give up Felfire without a fight. 
Help Thalyssra collect 3 of Vanthir's Arcane Essences.	Essence Triangulation	Vanthir... an example! That certainly explains why Elisande chose to hold him this long. We need to move quickly. I can track him, but I will need to find places where his Arcane Essence is strongest. This will not be an easy feat, not in a city this old, but with any luck there are a few places important enough to him that he left a little bit of himself behind. We should start in the promenade- he often visited it for business. 
Power up the archive device and view the holographic record for the Trial of Valor in the Terrace of the Watchers.	A Trial of Valor	To seek the Aegis of Aggramar, a champion must complete three great trials before riding into glorious battle through the Gates of Valor. Here you will find the knowledge of the trials you must seek out, as well as the first challenge you must face. Above us, adorning the central plateau, you will find the archive for the Trial of Valor. Seek it out, and learn where your path leads. 
Escort Revil Kost from Manor Mistmantle in Duskwood to Ariden's Camp in Deadwind Pass.	Following the Curse	In my previous confrontation with your foe, I was able to see a glimpse into their past. Granted blessed vision by the Cloak of Purity, I saw the Dark Riders for who they once were. Come, we must go to Ariden's Camp in Deadwind Pass. I can explain its significance along the way. 
	Supplies Needed: Astral Glory	 
Complete the third of Ursol's trials.	The Third Trial of Ursol	You've proven to me your strength and your courage, but do you possess the ability to apply yourself when it matters most? This final trial will reveal all. 
Put 10 Queen's Reprisal Sailors out of their misery.	Shipwrecked Sailors	<The gilblin and makrura of Mak'rana have captured the forsaken sailors from the nearby shipwreck.><It looks like the sailors are being poisoned and worse. Best to put them out of their misery.> 
Confront Sylvanas in the Vault of Eyir.	Ending the New Beginning	The Banshee Queen is here! I'd recognize those tainted arrows anywhere. This is the moment we have been fighting for. Sylvanas will answer for her crimes against Varian Wrynn and the Alliance! To arms! 
	Vantus Rune Work Order: Il'gynoth, The Heart of Corruption	 
Locate and secure Light's Judgment.	Bringing the Big Guns	Light's Judgment has a security feature to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. We can trigger its recall mechanism, which will teleport it back to a vessel. With the Xenedar out of commission, the gun should recall to your ship instead. You can make good use of its firepower. The process takes time, though, and will likely attract the Legion's attention. Be on your guard. 
Repair the Argunite Matrix beneath Triumvirate's End.	Consecrating Ground	We have everything we need. In the alcove below you will find the shattered remains of the Argunite Matrix. Replacing the Keystone will restore it to full capacity. The pylons you activated will then be able to repel those who still hunt my people. At long last this battle will be over. I hope it brings them peace. 
Speak to Vethir to fly to the top of Thorim's Peak.	Where Dragons Rule	Thanks to your help, Thrymjaris was able to escape the clutches of that vile demon. She bid me wait for you, so that I could take you to her once you had finished dispatching your foes. She has gathered our brood at the top of Thorim's Peak to prepare for a counterattack. Would you join us? 
	Devouring Darkness	 
Speak to Archmage Modera's associate at the Dalaran Crater within Hillsbrad Foothills	The Path of Atonement	Felo'melorn, the runeblade of the kings of Quel'Thalas. It was said to harness the very essence of flame and after being reforged by Kael'thas could even stand against the legendary Frostmourne. We thought that the blade was lost with Kael'thas's death but an associate of mine has a lead on where it may be located. We need every advantage we can get and with Felo'melorn in your hand the Legion surely will tremble! Ah, our company is here. 
Collect the 3 parts of the Nightrose recipe.	Challiane Vineyards	Please, outsider, help me. My recipe for Nightrose wine was to be the toast of Queen Azshara herself. But before I could make it, the vile vintners took it from me and locked me away. Please, recover my recipe so that I might bring it to Lady Challiane and earn the queen's favor. 
Go to Shield's Rest in Stormheim and claim the Truthguard.	Shrine of the Truthguard	We'll be flying straight to the island. My friend said that the warrior who came here before us never entered the shrine itself, since they were after one of the tombs. If a vrykul hero couldn't enter the shrine, I bet it's still protected by Tyr's power. I'm thinkin' we have a good shot at this. My pal Cato will meet us there. We might be needin' the talents of a good healer! 
Find Kor'vas Bloodthorn in the streets of Dalaran.	Protection: Aid of the Illidari	Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city. Kor'vas Bloodthorn of the Illidari has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks. I do not entirely trust these 'demon hunters', but they have at least proved adept at their namesake. I suggest you find her and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.|cFF660000Specialization: Protection Warrior|r 
Ask around the city for information on Levia Laurence.	Fury: The Folly of Levia Laurence	Levia Laurence was once a member of the Kirin Tor. Dabbling in shadow magic got her banned from the city, but she knows the streets too well to keep her out for good. Levia has disappeared, and I'm gravely concerned. Her work may have attracted the attention of the Legion. It has before. It would be very dangerous if her knowledge fell into their hands. She was last seen at the Scribe's Sacellum. Ask around there and see if you can pick up her trail.|cFF660000Specialization: Fury Warrior|r 
Meet with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection: March on Suramar	First Arcanist Thalyssra has sent word: the time has come to launch our assault on Suramar. The elven armies of the Horde, Alliance, Kirin Tor and Nightfallen are assembled. They only await your arrival to begin their assault. Report to Shal'Aran and meet with First Arcanist Thalyssra and prepare for battle. 
Locate Steelclaw Vale.	Archdruid of the Claw	Near the southern edge of our forest you will find Sleeper's Barrow. There, Archdruid Koda Steelclaw and her dedicated disciples carry out their sacred duty to observe the Emerald Dream. Find disciple Rylissa Bearsong in Steelclaw Vale and notify her of the crisis in the Grove of Cenarius. 
Use the Kvaldir Disguise to sneak by Guarm.	Stealth by Seaweed	There! The disguise be complete! Don't mind the smell, there. It's probably better that we smell like the kvaldir, as well. Though I have a feeling I'll be needin a priest to get this stench out once we're gone. 
Find Ethel Waterwise and reunite her with her family at the Hammer's Cradle in Thunder Totem.	Moozy's Reunion	You will never know how thankful we are to you, Human. Because of you, Moozy and my husband are safe. I won't let either of them out of my sight! I am sorry to ask one last favor of you, but do you think you could find my mother and bring her here so she can see that her grandchild is safe? Her name is Ethel, and her home is on the northern bluff of Thunder Totem. 
Slay 20 attackers in the Shattered Fields.	The Best Prevention	If you've brought the High Exarch back to us, you are a welcome ally indeed. More is needed of you. You see our soldiers out there, fighting against all odds? Defend them. Slay the enemy. Strong words for a priest, perhaps, but every dead man'ari is one less blade at our throats. Show them that the Light protects its chosen even as it scorches the unfaithful. When you are finished, seek out Y'mera. She will have fewer troops, and more need of your abilities. 
Slay drogbar in the Bitestone Enclave.	Bitestone Enclave	This is an old drogbar enclave that we used to trade with. Now it is a base of operations for their raids. I need more time to gather what is left of our warbraves. Go, enter the enclave, and slay any you find in there. Buy us the time we need to gather our strength. 
Complete the Rite of Blood.	Rite of Blood	Oakin Ironbull vouches for you. He's capable, for a Rivermane. You also brought with you proof of your own strength, albeit rather inconclusive proof. Before we allow you to move freely within our territory, you must complete the Rite of Blood, which you have already begun. If you succeed--and I doubt you will--talk to me. Enter the depths of the cave. Defeat whatever foe appears and return to me. 
Locate the scouts in the Promenade.	Taking a Promenade	These people are foreign to us, despite our common heritage. They have changed much in the years they have been cloistered away. We need to learn more about them, what they are capable of. We dispatched one of our scouts to infiltrate the Promenade and assess the defenses. The blood elves did the same, although I doubt their ability to be discreet. Both are long past due for reporting back to us. Find them and make sure they are safe or at least did not die in vain. 
	Feast of the Hounds	 
Join Sigryn at the Vault of Eyir in Skold-Ashil.	Unanswered Questions	What is done, is done. There are none left to challenge the throne of the Tideskorn. My brother's words still haunt me, though. If Eyir knows who ordered my family killed, I deserve to know it. Come, let us return. 
Meet with Karam Magespear at the Legerdemain Lounge in Dalaran.	Affliction: The Twisted Twin	I have a request from an old friend, Karam Magespear, to help find his brother, Raest. Karam fears that Raest is dealing with dark powers, and wishes to stop him. Originally Raest trained with the Kirin Tor, but such were his aspirations of power that he turned to the forbidden art of Necromancy. He was discovered and expelled from our order. Find Karam in the Legerdemain Lounge and see if you can lend a hand.|cFF660000Specialization: Affliction Warlock|r 
	Out of the Woodwork	 
Kill 8 Smolderhide furbolgs.	Frenzied Furbolgs	I would help you seek audience with the Archdruid, but we have a difficult situation on our hands. The nearby furbolgs have gone into a frenzied rage. For days, it has been all we can do to protect our grove from their aggression. They have cut off our access to the barrow dens, where the Archdruid and our clan sleep in the Emerald Dream. In order to awaken them, we must first get past the furbolg. 
Gather 4 Ancient Dreyrgrot tablets from the pirate ships outside of Dreyrgrot.	The Mystery of Dreyrgrot	Well met, good chap! I was on my way to study the local murlocs when I stumbled upon these most peculiar ruins. Those pirates over yonder arrived first, and it appears they've unleashed some ancient evil. I would be remiss to let such an evil run rampant, but we should learn more of it before we proceed, lest we end up like those chaps. I spied the crew bringing back some tablets from the ruins. If you can bring them to me, I may be able to decipher the nature of this evil. 
Confront Archmage Xylem.	The Archmage Accosted	With the barrier dispelled, Archmage Xylem is finally within reach! Hopefully he'll be cooperative in returning the Iris... 
Collect the Shard of Kozak.	Shard of Kozak	The demon leading the operation in Felsoul Hold is an eredar named Azoran. In order to get to him, we will need to open a portal to the Burning Legion command ship. Azoran has a demon jailer in his service known as Kozak the Afflictor. Kozak the Afflictor holds one of the key shards necessary to open a portal to the ship. He can be found in the prison quarters known as the Halls of the Eclipse in the lower portion of Felsoul Hold. Slay Kozak and place his key shard next to the portal. 
????	Mglrgrs Of Our Grmlgrlr	Mlrg...mglrmlr...Gmlrgmlr mglrml gmlrg! Mlrgrlgr!<Mrgrglilgrl points at the trail of spiderwebs leading out of the ruin.> 
Burn the Forsaken Blight Caches near Greywatch.	Combustible Contagion	It is true that we may have a lead on Sylvanas. Though I want nothing more than to get my hands on the Banshee Queen, the situation here at Greywatch requires immediate attention. Yesterday, a regiment of guards returned with word of Forsaken forces in the woods. Several of them bore signs of a blight, similar to the one we endured in Gilneas. It would appear these Forsaken seek to unleash this blight upon Greywatch. Seek out their caches and destroy them, before the blight overtakes us! 
Locate Baraat the Longshot, Grand Vindicator Sorvos, and Blademaster Telaamon.	Overt Ops	My soldiers are out there, George. I need you to find Baraat, Sorvos, and Telaamon. They were in the process of securing this area for Velen when the Legion came down on top of our heads. Inform them that their orders are to regroup with the Prophet at once. The time for subtlety has passed. There is a small army between us and them. Do what you must. Light keep you safe. 
Take the portal to Tol Barad and help find the Eye of Dalaran.	An Eye for a Scepter	Sounds simple? Make nice with Shadow Council friend must... for now. Help with ritual enough to gain trust, then turn tables! Council made portal device to Tol Barad here. Go, help Shadow Council find Eye of Dalaran, earn spot in big ritual! Then steal Scepter! Calydus will try to keep eye on friend when possible. 
Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, ""Shadowguard Dispersion"".	Shadowguard Dispersion	Lend me the aid of your order once again, that we might end the Shadowguard threat permanently. While you confront the Legion, we will face the void. The attack commences once your forces arrive. 
Speak with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Suramar for your reward.	Supplies From the Nightfallen	Outlander, I have some supplies for you. These goods are yours, earned by your continued efforts to our forces here in Suramar. I shall set aside similar treasures should you choose to aid our people more. You have my deepest thanks. 
Use the Crown of the Triumvirate while above the Antoran Wastes to open the way to Antorus.	The Burning Throne	The time has come, George, to begin our assault upon Antorus. Everything we have fought for, everything our friends and family have sacrificed, has brought us to this moment. We will fire Light's Judgment upon the walls of the accursed citadel and storm their seat of power. We will end the Legion. After all you have done, it is fitting that you have the honor. Activate the Crown of the Triumvirate and let us finish our mission. 
Choose a second artifact to pursue.	Bolstering Your Arsenal	Highlord, there are still weapons that you might obtain to help you defeat the Legion. We have kept a close eye on them during your time on the Broken Isles. I would be happy to review them with you if you wish. 
Meet with Khadgar in Suramar.	Take Me To Your Leader	I am glad you are here, George. This... Khadgar, the archmage who found my message, has called a meeting. He wishes to meet us at the entrance to the city as soon as possible. Will you accompany me? I have the strangest feeling that he will not be alone. 
Find Soulkeeper Uriah within Mucksnout Den.	The Soulkeeper's Fate	Soulkeeper Uriah was injured in the kobold attack, but insisted on venturing further into the cave to recover the stolen soul shards. He told me to wait here with our remaining supplies until he returned, but I fear the worst. Please find Uriah. He is the only one who knows how to trap the demons. 
	Terror of the Deep	 
Defeat Nader and search his body for clues.	Thunder on the Sands	I know the tale of Irmaat well. It is said that his home was the ancient city of Ahmtul, long buried under the desert sands. Recently a strange storm has appeared over the ruins. What's more, I am told that an elemental called Nader has attacked my people in nearby lands. These events must be related. Find this Nader and put an end to him. Make sure to search his body for clues as to what is behind this. 
Choose a second artifact to pursue.	Blades of Destiny	I'm glad that weapon you've been carrying around has proven useful. Our ally, the Lich King, has offered to provide you with a lead on another weapon should the one you already have somehow be lacking. Consider the options carefully and let me know which you would like to seek out. 
Escape Siren's Vigil.	Regroup	These people may be able to hold out here, but I know for certain that we cannot. Every moment we spend here places them in danger of Elisande's forces retaliating against us. We need to move. We need to find a place to regroup and recover. Follow me. I think I know how we can get out of here. 
Use the Talisman of the Prophet to sanctify 9 fallen Army of the Light warriors.	Preventive Measures	There is no end to the Legion's depravity. Every battle won, every world conquered, yields more souls to fuel their war machine. They have not yet defiled all of the fallen warriors in the hold, but I fear it is only a matter of time. Please, take this talisman with you into the hold and use it to sanctify any corpses you encounter. They deserve a better fate. 
Return to Khadgar in the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.	One Step Behind	It looks like Raest is out of our reach, but at least his cultists should prove less of a threat. We should return to the Kirin Tor. They should be able to help us plan our next move. 
Speak with Chromie a third time, then travel to the future and attempt to save her again.	The Many Advantages of Being a Time Dragon	Well, unfortunately for... whomever is fixated on blasting me into oblivion, I am a fairly skilled master of the timeways! We have the advantage of trying that again, and again, and again, until I'm not dead anymore. We're going to need a little more than a few seconds to stop this attack. How does four hours sound? 
Kill Apothecary Curseheart in the Dread-Rider Incursion.	Cut Out the Heart	This map points out the strategic locations of the Forsaken forces around Greywatch. A marker to the east indicates an apothecary camp where Dread-Riders are being supplied from. If you were to take out the apothecary in charge of creating this plague, it could stem the invasion and prevent the Dread-Riders from spreading the plague any further. 
	Runas the Shamed	I fell so quickly, George. I am not as strong as I once was. We truly do need your help. One of these disgusting creatures ran off with several of the whelplings. I heard him called by name:Runas. I will survive. Home is not far. You still have strength, though. Slay this Runas before he does any more damage to our brood. 
Help Lilryia Dawnwind find Nighteyes.	Turn Around, Nighteyes	Stranger, you must help me! Nighteyes, my old friend... he was scouting ahead and I heard him cry out a warning. I tried to run after him, but in my carelessness I stepped in this trap. He's so close, just on the other side of this ridge. Please find him! 
Meet Kalec at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.	The Light's Wrath	Light's Wrath... a bold choice. Though if you believe you can control its energies, it could prove vital to our cause. Retrieving it won't be easy. It was last held by the Kirin Tor, who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the blue dragonflight to secure away from the hands of men. Only they would know exactly where it was taken, or how to retrieve it. The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides upon the Council of Six in Dalaran. Seek him, and your answers, there. 
Obtain the Crystallized Soul from Archmage Khadgar.	Ask and You Shall Receive	A Legion communicator? Hmmmm.<Khadgar pauses to think for a moment.>You know what, I think I have something in my lockbox upstairs that is just the ticket. 
	Snowfeather Swarm!	 
Accompany King Anduin to the Tomb of Sargeras.	The King's Path	Now that I have seen the Broken Shore and the terror of the Burning Legion first hand, my eyes have been opened to the truth. I speak not of the unfathomable evil of the enemy, but of the bravery and sacrifice that such evil brings about in the hearts of our people. My father once told me that every king must carry the weight of his own crown. Mine has never felt heavier than it does at this very moment...Please take me to the place where my father died, so that I may honor his sacrifice. 
Speak with Calydus to choose which artifact you will pursue.	The Tome of Blighted Implements	The book you carry is the key to your friends' salvation, and to your absolute power! It holds within information about many relics too dangerous to the Legion to leave unchecked. Read, friend. And decide which of these artifacts you will use to strike Jagganoth down! 
Obtain the Head of Fathom-Commander Zarrin, and slay 8 of his naga troops.	They Came From the Sea	You're looking for Prince Farondis?<The ghostly elf narrows her eyes warily.>I can take you to Farondis... but first things first. These naga attacked suddenly. They take orders from one called Zarrin, in the low hills to the west. Help me take Zarrin's head, and you'll have my ear. 
Work with Allari the Souleater to compel information from the demon souls.	The Scythe of Souls	Let's head to the other side of the stand. We will release the demon souls one by one and get the answers that we seek concerning Lord Illidan. The Scythe of Souls will ensure that we do. 
Assist Delandros by removing the last of the attackers.	The Shrine in Peril	You've helped us greatly, champion. Now, it is time that you tell me what brings you here.<You mention to Delandros that Archdruid Greathoof sent you to seek the Fangs of Ashamane.>Hrm... if you had told me this at the outset, I would have told you to take a walk. The Fangs are our greatest treasure, but you've done a great deed for the Ashen today and I am an elf of my word. Very well, let's clear out the rest of these demons and you shall have your weapons. 
Go to Bradensbrook in Val'sharah.	Mistweaver: The Bradensbrook Investigation	We have uncovered forged orders from the Shore. They have a fel influence about them. They guide the reader to believe they are legitimate. It orders Black Rook Hold to attack a ""demonic enclave"" just south of their walls. There's only one enclave they could be talking about, Bradensbrook! Is it possible these would be able to convince the undead to attack Bradensbrook? You should head there immediately and either warn them, or render aid.|cFF660000Specialization: Mistweaver Monk|r 
Take the Aldrachi Warblades from Caria Felsoul.	Vengeance Will Be Ours	We aren't going to get our forces anywhere near the Broken Shore without getting knocked out of the sky. I think it best if you handle this matter yourself - there are none among us more capable on the field of battle. Save Allari and her men if you can, but the Aldrachi Warblades will do far more for this war than warm bodies. 
Travel to the Throne of Tides and acquire Sharas'dal.	Throne of the Tides: Azshara's Power	Wavespeaker Adelee tracked Sharas'dal to the Throne of Tides within the Abyssal Maw, then disappeared. George, if we go after her, we are almost certainly walking into a trap. But the elements are with us, my friend. The naga will not expect a shaman of your caliber! Swim to the Throne of Tides to the Northwest, within the Abyssal Depths. I will join you once you are inside. Let's find our missing shaman and get that artifact! 
Release 3 Nightborne Citizens from their captivity.	Friends in Cages	<Korine stomps her foot and refuses to move.>They put my friends in cages! Make the bad men stop hurting them! They take them out the garden and they never come back!<Korine gestures stubbornly toward the door.>I am not going home until they do! 
Speak to Lady Aurore.	Either With Us	Thalyssra asks much of me, but our cause is worth the risks. The title of advisor would grant us enormous influence. Information. Access. I could change this rebellion. I could save so many lives. I will need strong endorsement to ascend, though. There are many houses who stand with me by virtue of my family's name. Some are more hesitant. Lady Aurore of House Astravar is the most prominent of these. Seek her out. Offer your aid in my stead. Earn her trust and the rest will follow. 
Use your built up Unstable Arcane Energy to destroy the Surge Needles in Coldarra.	Arcane Unleashed	You have the power you need to destroy the Surge Needles. At the location of the breaches where the Surge Needles pierce the ground, there will be a large concentration of void energy. Focus the power of Aluneth into these points. The reaction should cause an overload, destroying the Surge Needle above. You must act quickly. The Ethereum won't sit idly by as you lay waste to their machinations. 
Meet Lord Maxwell Tyrosus at Uther's Tomb in Western Plaguelands.	Seeking Guidance	Highlord Tirion may be gone, but the Ashbringer is still out there somewhere. Its power would devastate the Legion. We must find it! I wish it were as simple as returning to where Tirion fell. It could be anywhere on that infernal landscape by now. I believe an old friend can help us find the blade. I ask that you place your faith in me and journey to Uther's tomb in the Plaguelands. We will seek answers there. 
Stabilize 8 Erratic Power Conduits.	Conservation of Magic	I have an idea. This construct will be of use to us. We simply need to jolt it awake. We once stored great quantities of energy in conduits throughout the Conservatory. They are still functional, but only just. Take this.<Y'mera hands you a brightly glowing crystal.>It will provide a small burst of magic that should help stabilize an erratic conduit. I think I have enough stored for eight or so. Stabilizing a few should allow us to access the whole network. 
Take the Fel Bat to the Tomb of Sargeras and steal the Scepter of Sargeras.	Ritual Ruination	Time for main event, friend! Gul'dan wants to begin his big ritual, cause end times for this world. Calydus confident getting the Scepter will stop that plan. Take this bat to Tomb of Sargeras, find ritual, steal Scepter. Oh... and get out! Calydus will help when he can! Good luck, friend! 
Track Malfurion's path through the Nightmare.	Heart of the Nightmare	I know only that my husband is somewhere deeper in this twisted forest. He is still alive, but it remains to be seen if he is whole.<Tyrande's expression hardens into a scowl as she peers at you.>Elune herself cannot protect Xavius if he is not. 
Confront Helya and leave Helheim.	Paid in Lifeblood	We have fulfilled Helya's bargain. Now, we see if she will keep to her word. When you are ready, we should proceed to the throne. If you have any other business here, I would suggest finishing it now. I will follow your lead, outsider. 
Deliver a beatdown to Ooker Dooker.	No Time for Tryouts	We don't have time for you to go through a lengthy set of tryouts. But, fighting in the arena is our best chance at getting you in good with the giants. That kind-hearted giant over there that's losing against Bilgerudder is Sternfathom. If you were to defeat his hozen champion, you'd make yourself a spot on his team. Looks like Ooker Dooker's taking a rest between bouts. Now's the time to deliver a good ol' monkey beatdown. 
Speak with Torok Bloodtotem.	An Audience with Torok	I should warn you that Torok is easily displeased and is hateful of outsiders. Be on your guard. We will seek an audience with him at his tent at the Cliff's Edge. As the Rivermane Emissary here, I am afforded some protection against aggression, but they have made no such promises about you. 
	Where There is a Whip...	 
Defeat Dread Vizier Gra'tork in Val'sharah.	Battle for Val'sharah	From the very start of these attacks I've felt as though the demons knew our plans, as if they anticipated our every move. If we are to put an end to this we must focus our attacks at the heart of the beast. Your efforts have shown these battles are not won by bravery alone, but willingness and sacrifice. I ask that you stand on the battlefield once more among allies to bring this madness to an end. 
Speak with Vindicator Jaelaana on the Vindicaar for your reward.	Supplies From the Army of the Light	Archenon poros, champion. The Army of the Light wishes to thank you for your aid against the Legion's forces on Argus. Please accept these supplies with our gratitude. Your continued support brings us ever closer to our ultimate goal of eradicating the Legion once and for all. 
	Feed Oculeth	 
Fill a cup with moonwell water and obtain Leafbeard the Storied's blessing.	Necessary Preparations	G'Hanir is... is...<Mylune wipes her eyes, sniffling.>Corrupted! The Nightmare has risen from the depths of the dream. It all happened so fast...I was able to secret the staff here through the dream before it fell fully. It rests for now... but I fear we don't have much time. You must prepare to retrieve G'Hanir from the Dream. Draw water from the sacred moonwell on the northern edge of the grove and obtain an ancient's blessing. Quickly - every moment is precious! 
Go to Astravar Harbor and begin the siege of Nighthold with the elves.	Gates of the Nighthold	Our combined armies are arrayed in front of the palace, ready to strike! I cannot believe the time has come. Your allied commanders are already there and we will join you. Make your way to Astravar Harbor and speak with Khadgar. He is coordinating the attack, or at least I think he is. See you there... and thanks for everything. 
Speak with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn to learn about Huln Highmountain.	The Story of Huln	You work to unite the tribes. That is no small task. It has only been done once before in the history of this mountain. Huln Highmountain last united the tribes thousands of years ago to take on the Legion during the War of the Ancients. 
	Beasts of Burden	 
Use the Sharp Wooden Stake to kill Blood-Thane Lucard in Dreyrgrot.	What the Bonespeakers Buried	Most Fascinating! It would appear that we're dealing with our very own vrykul vampyr! All we have encountered have been of blood elven descent, but it has long been theorized that the vrykul have suffered the curse as well. It's too bad he's awake - I would dearly like a subject to study. Oh well, guess there's nothing for it. Take this stake and put it through the old chap's heart. I'm pretty sure that should do the trick. 
Retrieve 15 Tel'anor Mementos.	Fragments of Memory	<The beautiful elven burial urn is shattered carelessly on the ground. It was clearly handled roughly, but not scratched by the talons of the harpies.><You find a trail of shards leading towards a cave. Those responsible are certainly within. Thaedris would be interested in the relics and their safe return.> 
Obtain a Nar'thalas Academy Hat, Robes, Wand, and Spellbook.	Dressing With Class	Now stop right there. Look at you! You look like you just walked in off of the street. Where are your robes and hat? And don't tell me you've entered the academy without your wand and spellbook. Freshmen. Put yourself together, and maybe then I will consider letting you enter the academy. 
Practice using your wand on 10 Wand Targets.	Wanding 101	We'll start with some wand work. You have your wand with you? Good. I've set up a number of targets around the hall. Use your wand to hit as many as you can. And no point-blank shots! That's cheating. 
Travel to Therazane's Throne and speak with Therazane the Stonemother.	What the Stonemother Knows	We must split up. I am still badly wounded from my encounter with Geth'xun, and I don't want to appear weak before the Stonemother. This task falls to you. Travel to Therazane's Throne and speak to Therazane herself. Find out if she has seen the Doomhammer. Help her if she asks. She is dangerous and mercurial, but this is her realm, and without her aid we will find nothing. 
	Weapons of Deathwing	 
Meet with Toryl in the Sashj'tar Grotto.	Jandvik's Last Hope	Commander Malt'his was conferring with a sea giant? Without your help, this village will surely fall to the combined forces of the Sashj'tar and the sea giants.<Toryl stands there quietly for a moment.>Meet me in an underground cave out in Azuregale Bay. I want to show you something that may turn the tide in this battle. 
Use Stormbeak to fly into the Maelstrom with Thrall and Mylra.	Where the Hammer Falls	You saved us all, shaman! Thank you! Thrall wants to dive right into the Maelstrom and retrieve the Doomhammer, but I worry - he was badly wounded in that last fight, and that demon Geth'xun may still be alive down there. We should go with him. Hop on Stormbeak when you're ready and we'll track down that artifact! 
Remove the disguise of 5 Nightborne Infiltrators.	Something's Not Quite Right...	Something is troubling me, champion. Beyond these simple japes, the Kirin Tor has had to break up a few fights between the elves. I am worried something - or someone - might be influencing them. Your disguise was made by the nightborne, yes? It is not unreasonable to assume they can do something similar. Fortunately, Thalyssra has told me much about how the illusion works, and I believe this crystal can remove their disguise. Why don't you check the camps, just to be safe? 
Catch 15 drops of Nightwell Essence using an Energy Vessel.	Intense Concentration	This is a rare treat, I hope you know. Not just anyone is allowed to stand on this hallowed ground.<Sylverin adjusts his cuffs in a dignified fashion.>To participate in the demonstration, simply take up an energy vessel and wade into the pool beside us. Catch the delicate dewdrops of Nightwell energy in the bowl as they fall- this is the only way one can safely manage its essence. Once your vessel is full, proceed to our demonstration cask and gently pour the amalgamation into it. Enjoy! 
Assassinate Felcaller Whitley at Raven Hill in Duskwood and search his body for information.	No Sanctuary	We have one other lead that may prove useful. Goes by Felcaller Whitley, another of the cult's elite. He's eluded our agents at every turn. Our latest reconnaissance report puts him somewhere in the village of Raven Hill in Duskwood. He's sure to have information vital to your search. You know what to do. 
<insert>	Assault on Skold-Ashil	<insert> 
	The Magic of Flight	 
Take the Warden's Signet to Jarod Shadowsong.	The Warden's Signet	The night elf was carrying a signet engraved with the crest of the Wardens. The band, made from a silvery, unbreakable metal, has been worn down by time, as if absently twisted and rubbed against its owner's finger. 
Open 8 Soul Engine Cages.	A Fate Worse Than Dying	When the Burning Legion takes a prisoner, it is not an act of mercy. While death is the destruction of the mortal body... if you are captured by the Legion, they will seek to destroy your soul. The Burning Legion uses sacrificial souls to power their demonic machinations of war. The soul engine is where the harvested souls are collected and stored. Though countless have already perished in the soul engine, you may yet save those still alive inside. Hurry and release them before it is too late! 
Meet Ritssyn Flamescowl in the Chamber of the Guardian beneath Dalaran.	Bargaining with Shadows	From the clues you've been able to piece together, it appears that Levia was looking to conduct a ritual in the libraries beneath Dalaran - most likely to summon this ""Agatha"" she has become so infatuated with. I'm afraid this is a little out of my area of expertise, so I'm going to have to call in a favor. I'll send for assistance from the Council of the Black Harvest. One of their warlocks will meet you in the Chamber of the Guardian to assist with your investigation. I hope we're not too late. 
Slay Overseer Ingra.	Powering Down the Portal	Destroying the crystals will stop them temporarily, but it will be meaningless if we do not deal with the person controlling the portal itself. I heard their overseer, Ingra, shouting orders for more power so that she could bring the stronger Legion lieutenants through the gate. We must stop her to truly seal the portal for good. 
Plant 3 Gilnean Heavy Explosives onto the hull of Greymane's ship and detonate them at a safe distance.	A Gift for Greymane	It looks like the Gilnean infiltrators brought some heavy ordnance to the fight. It's likely they intend to use them on the walls of Dreadwake's Landing. If these could be rigged to Greymane's ship, it could make for a decisive end to his assault on the outpost. 
Find Kor'vas Bloodthorn in the streets of Dalaran.	Blood: Aid of the Illidari	Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city. Kor'vas Bloodthorn of the Illidari has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks. I do not entirely trust these 'demon hunters', but they have at least proved adept at their namesake. I suggest you find her and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.|cFF660000Specialization: Blood Death Knight|r 
Speak with Oculeth and teleport to Azsuna.	Oculeth Ex Machina	I have a plan to feed Shal'Aran. Now that I am no longer starving for mana I have had time to study ley lines in new regions. I detected an eddy of mana in the ley lines of Azsuna. I have plenty of magic at my disposal, but we must visit the ley line in person in order to properly redirect the energy to Shal'Aran. Oculeth has graciously offered to teleport us there, but I could use an assistant. Care to join me? 
Speak with Navarrogg at Stonedark Grotto.	Step into the Dark	With the threat to my people quelled, I believe it is time to introduce you to my kin. Meet me at Stonedark Grotto, and you will see where we live. 
Establish the Order of the Silver Hand using the Libram of Ancient Kings.	A United Force	The paladins of Azeroth must stand united behind a single leader. With Tirion's passing, you are the one most worthy to wear the mantle of Highlord. If you agree to accept this duty, inscribe your name into the Libram of Ancient Kings and I will address the masses on your behalf. The Order of the Silver Hand is reborn, with you as its champion! 
Grapple across from the tower and climb to the top of the mountain path.	Above the Winter Moonlight	You should have a good vantage from this tower to grapple over to the mountain path. I can't help you once you're across, but you should be able to take it all the way up to the top. I hope you're able to find what you need from the dragons up there. Who knows what the God-King has done to them. 
Escort Korine back to her mother Verene at the Waning Crescent.	Little One Lost	I'm ready to go home now, but there are still scary men outside...Will you stay with me? Make sure they don't take me away? I don't want to go back in the cage... 
Pour Havi some grog.	A Threat Rises	It is time I told you another tale. While you listen, would you be so kind as to pour me some grog? I've grown a terrible thirst. The keg is very old and the tap is a bit slow. 
Follow Spiritwalker Ebonhorn on the Path of Huln.	The Path of Huln	Armies are vital to the success of a war. But so are symbols. For our people, few things make for a better symbol than the blessings of our most eldest ancestors. Mayla must walk the Path of Huln. The path is dangerous, and she may only bring two people with her: a spiritwalker to guide her and a champion to protect her. Will you be the champion? 
Use your glaives to rip open a gateway to the Fel Hammer in Mardum.	Securing the Way	I was able to make contact with our forces on Mardum - they secured the Fel Hammer after our departure all those years ago and have held it ever since! Malevolence has utilized the ship's warp systems to transport the bulk of our forces aboard, but doing so greatly taxes what little power remains. I believe there to be a better way. Your glaives carry a piece of the power of Kil'jaeden - you should be able to use them to open a permanent gateway to the Fel Hammer. 
Confront Amateur Hunters within Pinerock Basin.	Amateur Hour	The hunters' lodge has attracted a lot of amateurs who call themselves hunters. They're scarin' away all the prize game with their antics. While I'm a known expert with my rifle, I've yet to manage the art of negotiation. How about ya do us all a favor and tell those novice hunters to head for the hills? 
Defeat Garzareth, Karuas, Muorg and Ravathes in Gates of Valor.	Break the Spine	To lead his tainted forces, the God-King has enlisted demons of great power to act as his lieutenants. If we wish to end his assault, we will need to take their leaders. These demons are too powerful for most mortals to face, but with the power of Stormheim at your disposal, they will prove no match for you. Take them down, and shatter the spine of Skovald's offensive! 
	Returning Champion	 
Escort Prince Farondis to the Ruins of Nar'thalas.	Trailing the Tidestone	Your quest for the Tidestone... it intrigues me. More than that, it suits my needs quite well. I have been in need of a champion for a very, very long time. It is decided, then. I shall join you. We will have to head east, through Nar'thalas. Shall we depart? 
Recover an Invocation Array, Vindicator Plating, and a Judgment Core.	Scars of the Past	The Army of the Light's warframes have won countless battles on Argus. Despite their power, not all who descend into the fray return. My modifications to this frame should give us the edge we need, but several critical components are still missing. There are remains of battles past in Nath'raxas that we can still scavenge. If you can find the pieces I need, the Legion will feel our fury yet. 
Heal 8 Felbound Drudges.	A Stranger's Plea	My people... enslaved...Beaten... within death's grasp...<The cowled figure weakly raises his arm, handing you a small liquid skin.>Help... us... 
Speak with Travard in Dalaran.	The Mysterious Paladin	It appears we have been afforded a unique opportunity. A small order of paladins has come forward claiming to know the location of Tyr's tomb. They say they are the protectors of his warhammer, but that the ancient weapon is now imperiled. I'd like you to speak with Travard, their leader, to find out more about this artifact. 
Slay Keeper Varethos.	Given to Corruption	A final favor for an old friend, perhaps? My age-old companion, Varethos, has fallen to the nightmare's torment. We once worked in unison to protect this land. His close ties to the land brought him low in this dark hour. As with all who suffer this fate, there is no restoring him. Please, George, bring him peace. 
	Work Order: Word of Mastery	 
Select an artifact weapon to pursue.	The Power to Survive	We have long relied on Lord Illidan to vanquish the Legion's strongest warriors - many have expressed concern over our efforts without him. Thankfully, their concerns may not matter much longer. We know of two pairs of blades rumored to be more powerful than even Lord Illidan's that are not yet out of reach. If we act quickly we should be able to hunt down one without forsaking our watch over the Legion's movements. I must defer judgment on which is most worthy of our time to you, George. 
Select your next assault point on the Broken Isles at the Command Map in your Order Hall.	Isle Hopping	<Victory in hand, you know there are still Pillars of Creation that must be recovered if the Legion is to be defeated once and for all.><Your order has identified uncharted regions of the Broken Isles that still house the remaining Pillars - looking over the information would help focus your next effort.> 
Destroy the Horde Siege Cannon.	Sky Ablaze With Cannonfire	Oh! It's me! And George, was it? I remember this! I seem to have found myself in the middle of a battle between the Horde and the Alliance, which wouldn't USUALLY be a big deal, except for that enormous cannon that seems to be trained on me anytime I try to fly away. Think you could take it out for me? 
Search the battlefield for Legion troops and kill them to get their Enigmatic Legion Orders. Retrieve the Army of the Light Code Book to decipher the orders.	Intercepting the Legion's Plans	Our scout Skara writes in the missive that she learned of a major Legion initiative. She was after two encoded orders held by Legion troops near us to get the details and this must be when she was killed. The Legion splits their messages into encoded parts so that we cannot read them. Skara also writes that her partner Brae, a codebreaker, was slain trying to reach our lines with a code book that we will need to translate the Legion's orders. It is vital you find the orders and that code book! 
Arm 25 Shipwrecked Captives.	The Right Weapon for the Job	<You and Okuna were going to arm the captives in here. The idea was to free them and cause as much chaos as possible. It's the only sure way to be able to get close to the prince. You still have the weapons. You're just going to have to be careful sneaking around the giants.> 
Use Ancient Mana to feed Chief Telemancer Oculeth.	Hungry Work	We must get Chief Telemancer Oculeth back on his feet as soon as possible. Find ancient mana, any way you can, and feed it to him. 
Kill 8 Darkfiend Intruders.	The Demons Below	Something, someone, intended us to never awaken. I sense their presence is still here in the barrow.<Koda takes a moment to stand.>My body is weak from deep slumber. If you would aid us, clear our barrow of any enemies. 
Speak with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn.	A Walk With the Spirits	The spiritwalker you saved from Riverbend has been insufferable since his arrival. He is insisting on showing you the ways of our people so that you better understand what is to come. He is a strange one, even by spiritwalker standards. Even so, only a fool would discard his insight. Please, go to speak with him when you get a moment. 
	Yet More Intact Demon Eyes	 
Obtain the Tidestone Vault Key from Elya Azuremoon, the Academy Headmistress.	The Headmistress' Keys	I have a suspicion you are avoiding your studies - but I can see you're anxious to see the Headmistress. Very well! Headmistress Azuremoon can be found up ahead, though I doubt she will enjoy being interrupted. 
Place the eagle eggs in the empty nest above the eastern entrance to Rockcrawler Chasm.	Empty Nest	I've taken an inventory of the eggs you recovered. Some among the bunch may still have a chance to hatch. They will need to be returned to an empty nest, and with any luck, an eagle will claim the eggs as her own and watch over them once again. There is a nest just outside the entrance, on a rocky ledge above the cave. Be careful, George. The eggs are very delicate. 
Use your built up Unstable Holy Energy to destroy the Surge Needles in Coldarra.	Unleashing Judgment	You have the power you need to destroy the Surge Needles. At the location of the breaches where the Surge Needles pierce the ground, there will be a large concentration of void energy. Focus the power of Light's Wrath into these points of focused void, and the reaction should cause an overload, destroying the Surge Needle above. You must act quickly. The Ethereum likely won't sit idly by as you lay waste to their machinations. 
	Felhide	 
Confront Akaari Shadowgore in the Legerdemain Lounge.	Closing In	The Legerdemain Lounge isn't far from here. We have agents nearby who can secure the area. Come prepared for a fight. Akaari won't go down easily. 
Collect Climbing Treads, an Oiled Cloak, and an Enchanted Lodestone from Hrydshal.	To Weather the Storm	I've been doing some nosing around, and it looks like these vrykul are making regular trips up the mountain themselves. They've got some specialized gear for it, so while we're here we should take some. I'd recommend finding some climbing treads to keep your grip on the slopes, as well as an oiled cloak to keep the rain out. Also, it looks like they carry enchanted lodestones, which seem to keep the lightning at bay. You should probably grab one of those, too. 
Gain access to Alodi's personal bank vault in Dalaran and retrieve the Mana Gems.	Alodi's Gems	Arrexis had a cadre of apprentices and subordinates to help him with the ritual, something you are currently lacking. In older times, when magic was less understood and spells required vast amounts of mana to cast, we stored mana in gems for use in complex spells. Lucky for us, I still have a few powerful Mana Gems in my vault, along with some other useful items. You merely need to go to the Bank of Dalaran and gain access. 
Disrupt the Legion forces in Arinor Gardens.	Wrath of the High Exarch	Where the Legion is concerned, violence is always the answer.<Turalyon hefts his blade with a grim expression.>They are between us and Velen. Nothing will stop them from finding him unless we act. Now is not the time to hold back. Together we will sow chaos among their ranks. 
Slay Managazer, the Basilisk Lord.	Managazer	There is one basilisk here who has gorged himself so thoroughly on Nightsaber flesh that he seldom leaves his cave. We will use this to our advantage. Seek out the basilisk Managazer and use his death as an example to the others who have strayed from their home. 
Take the Scythe of Elune from Valorn.	Its Rightful Place	Though it goes against my better judgment, it is Tyrande's wish that the Scythe of Elune be brandished once more against the new Legion threat. It is a small comfort to see it wielded by a keeper of the balance, such as yourself. Know that the last time the scythe was wielded, it resulted in great calamity. You must be vigilant to contain the bestial wrath that ebbs within. With those words in your heart, take the scythe and bring its fury against our foes. May the light of Elune protect you. 
Repel the Burning Legion forces throughout Highmountain.	Assault on Highmountain	In my years I have seen disturbances and threats come and go, but never before have I seen such brazen disregard for life. The demons may scorch our lands and cause suffering amongst our kin, but we must not stand idly by while they threaten what we have fought so hard to create. Rise to the occasion, George. The time has come to stand against the Burning Legion! 
Rescue 8 Shal'dorei Insurgents in the Grand Promenade.	A Better Future	We must move quickly, George. I must save as many of my people as I can before the attack begins. Word has gotten out in the city that there is a safe haven with us and some no longer fear exile. Venture into the Grand Promenade, champion. Find those willing to join us and let them know it is time they made their escape. 
	Threads of Fate	 
	Skreeg the Devourer	 
	Prisoners of Greystone	 
	Blistermaw	 
Collect 7 Shimmering Snapper Scales.	Turtle Powered	In order to locate and purify the source of the corruption I am going to need an elemental focus. The turtles around here have developed scales that can focus and amplify their innate magics. Bring back some snapper scales and we will have these waters purified in no time! 
Recover the Transponder Battery from Dread-Rider Malwick.	Assault and Battery	We need to report our position to the Alliance navy ASAP! I am building a new transponder to send a distress signal, but I need a battery from the Skyfire's communications console. You'll find the console at the top of the ship - I just hope those undead haven't put their creepy, bony fingers on it yet! 
Use the Skyfire Propeller to broadcast a distress signal, then hold out until help arrives.	Signal Boost	The Skyfire's starboard propeller came to rest on the cliffs overlooking our camp - we're gonna use it like a big antenna and push our distress signal so far that even Mekkatorque's alarm clock could pick it up! Unfortunately, it might attract some unwanted attention. We're braced for enemy contact down here at the camp - fire up that signal and be ready to defend the antenna! 
	Slab of Bacon	 
	By Water Be Purged	 
Place the Sizeable Pouch of Gold in Akazamzarak's tip bucket.	The Great Akazamzarak	There is a goblin who is a master of portals and teleportation by the name of Akazamzarak. His talents have gone mostly unnoticed, however, since he mostly uses them for chicanery. He is, what you would call, a street performer. Fortunately for us, he is performing in the streets of Dalaran, grifting coins from the unenlightened masses. Take this bag of gold. See if you can convince him to change vocations. 
Collect a piece of Needle Coral and then rescue 5 Captured Vrykul in Azuregale Bay.	Bubble Trouble	Mechanic! The sea giants have already eaten half of my kin. We are helpless in these accursed bubbles. I beseech you to get us out of here. Take heed. These bubbles are strong. You will need something that is extremely sharp to pierce them. 
Slay 8 Vineyard Enforcers or Wardens.	Vengeance for Margaux	<Sylverin sputters, pale-faced with rage.>How could they? Margaux did everything they asked of her and more! The arcwine never stopped flowing despite everything they did to us! To her! Such injustice cannot stand. We must take vengeance for Margaux. 
Reform Hati.	Bonds of Thunder	While you infused Hati's essence into the Thunderspark, I have concocted a flawless plan the likes of which the scientific world has never seen! I'll spare you the technical details. Just follow my instructions and Hati will be back in one piece in no time at all!...Or we will all explode. But risks must be taken in the pursuit of knowledge and the well-being of our furry companions, wouldn't you agree? 
Retrieve the Tears of Elune.	Tears for Fears	The Tears of Elune are a sacred artifact, protected by my order for thousands of years. I tell you this so that you may understand the gravity of your request. That said, Ysera is noble and wise and I trust in her guidance. You will find the tears in a vault at the eastern edge of the temple grounds. Proceed with caution though, as that area has been overrun by demons. 
Gather 5 Skyfire First Aid Kits.	Supplies From the Skies	Are you feeling alright? Say 'ah.'<Mishka attempts to depress your tongue with a damp twig.>Sorry... we are in desperate need of medical supplies here. The infirmary on the Skyfire was well-stocked, but it's all scattered to the winds now. Anything you can salvage from the wreck will save lives! 
Find 4 Large, 4 Medium, and 4 Small Ceremonial Drums in Thunder Totem.	Ceremonial Drums	Those foolish calves! They've made off with our ceremonial drums again, treating them as toys... as... common drums! Can you help me find them? They must be scattered to all corners of Thunder Totem by now, discarded as soon as the fun dries up. 
Speak with Jale Rivermane at Riverbend.	High Water	Riverbend! Is that what the Underking said? That is my home and the place where we store our winter supplies. We must make it there at all speed and warn them. Meet me there. 
Talk to 10 Swamprock Tadpoles.	Nature vs. Nurture	I appreciate murloc-kind far too much to tell you to go kill all the adults. What we should be doing is setting up the next generation to be more peaceful; Murky is the best representative for this. Bring him to talk to the murloc tadpoles. He'll get them on our side. 
Return to Starsong Refuge.	Regroup at the Refuge	I cannot think clearly in this place. Even though the moonwell is still pure, the corrupting influence of the Nightmare remains. Come, we will return to the refuge and gather our wits. Then we will continue the hunt for my husband. 
Collect 8 Shadescale Flyeaters.	Balance to Spare	Our tour is just about over. I will let you loose to 'walk the orchard', as is proper at this stage. While you are there, you will notice a large number of mana wyrms floating about. I am certain the vineyard would not miss a handful of them. Good luck with your insect problem, friend.<Margaux smiles warmly at you.> 
	Faerie Fracas	 
Return to Arch Druid Greathoof in the Dreamgrove.	The Burden Borne	Your assistance against the Dark Riders has proven a great service to the Light. Though our beliefs may separate us, I know that we share one goal. You have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners, and for this I am thankful. As for the Scythe of Elune, I can think of no safer place than in your care. May it serve you well against the Legion, George. 
Raise the dead buried in the Sodden Graves in Deadwind Pass until you find one who can point you to the Dark Riders location.	A Grisly Task	Wet soil? Shallow graves? I think the journal is referring to the gravesites off of the lake near Karazhan. Nobody knows who is buried there, but they may be the key to finding the Dark Riders. You can... speak to the dead, yes? 
Plant the Seed of Ages in the Soft Soil within The Dreamgrove.	Sowing The Seed	Your weapon is ancient and powerful but it holds the potential to be so much more. Take this seed, it is all that remains of a forest that grew tall when the world was young. Plant it within the grove to the west and allow it to take root. With its power both it and your weapon will be far more than they are alone. 
Charge the dreamcatcher using owlbeast totems in Lostlight Grotto.	Dreamcatcher	I cannot hold on for much longer...I brought a dreamcatcher with me. I was to use it to steal the magic from owlbeast totems. It is the only way to break the barrier where they hold Keeper Remulos. Please help where I have failed. 
Slay 12 withered in the Azurewing Whelplands.	The Withered	The withered are the worst kind of pest. They capture our whelplings, knock them unconscious, and then drink whatever mana they can from the helpless babes. Normally our drakes and keepers would fend them off. Today, it looks like we may need your help. 
Slay Spymaster Illandris and Spymaster Shwayder.	Masters of Disguise	<You scan over Knockwhistle's report.>""My chute caught a piece of shrapnel. Made a rough landing in a ravenbear nest. Luckily, a bunch of eggs broke my fall. Lost sight of Illandris and Shwayder. Both are masters of disguise, and I am confident they can remain undetected. Will continue to monitor the enemy's activity. Just need to clean all the yolk off my cloaking device. Hope the mother's not around... 
Enter Darkheart Thicket and Slay the Shade of Xavius.	Darkheart Thicket: Enter the Nightmare	We could not save Ysera, but we did prevent her from destroying the temple. Now I can finally turn my attention to my husband. I do not know what fate he suffers now. I only know that if we stand any chance of saving him, you must go now. Follow Xavius into the Nightmare and find Malfurion. Please, save my husband if you can. 
Travel to Darkstone Isle near the Broken Shore and search for Alora.	Out of the Darkness	Alora and I were were able to escape through one of the Legion's portals back to Azeroth but that's about as far as our luck got us. The portal put us on a small isle somewhere to the west of the Broken Shore. They saw us quickly and we made a run for the protection of the water. As I attempted to leap to safety, I was wounded. But Alora... she tripped and I watched them drag her back. Rescue her, please! I'll mark where the camp is on your map, just don't let her go through that ordeal again. 
Defeat Kuglaroth.	They Have A Pitlord	The Feltotem are not the first to embrace the temptations of the Burning Legion. And they will not be the last. But in their arrogance, they have conjured a pit lord. Will you join us in battle against this beast? The power of your artifact and skill could prove invaluable against such a creature. 
Shoot the Critter Hand Cannon near wolf packs so that they scatter, allowing the packleaders to be singled out.	Wolf Pack Attack	It's time to attack the pack! I've preloaded the hand cannon. All you have to do is point and shoot. The critters should survive the blast and hit the ground running. The howlers will be distracted by the critters, allowing you to focus on killing the packleaders. Happy hunting! 
Ask around the city for information on Levia Laurence.	Feral: The Folly of Levia Laurence	Levia Laurence was once a member of the Kirin Tor. Dabbling in shadow magic got her banned from the city, but she knows the streets too well to keep her out for good. Levia has disappeared, and I'm gravely concerned. Her work may have attracted the attention of the Legion. It has before. It would be very dangerous if her knowledge fell into their hands. She was last seen at the Scribe's Sacellum. Ask around there and see if you can pick up her trail.|cFF660000Specialization: Feral Druid|r 
Inspect 4 Duskwatch Scrying Orbs in the Terrace of Enlightenment.	Those Scrying Eyes	Until recently, Ly'leth was sending magical messages to us regularly from within the Nighthold. She took care to hide these messages - only the most vigilant scryers could have detected them. They could not be within the palace... too much interference from the Nightwell...Of course! The Terrace of Enlightenment! The Duskwatch must have set up a listening post there. Check the scrying orbs for traces of Ly'leth's messages. We must learn what she was trying to tell us! 
Destroy the Legion's Conduit at the Temple of a Thousand Lights.	A Conduit No More	One final task remains to sever the Burning Legion's connection to other worlds. I'll provide you transportation to get you close to the source of power, but you must deliver the final blow to the conduit. 
Search around Ariden's Camp for clues leading to the Dark Riders.	Disturbing the Past	This place is where the merchant, Ariden, set up camp while he was trying to ply his dubious wares to the sorcerer Medivh. It has remained strangely untouched for all this time, which leads me to believe it may still have a connection to its former owner. Help me search the camp. Let's see if we can find something to lead us to the Dark Riders. 
Select an artifact weapon to pursue.	Prepare To Strike	The Burning Legion took us by surprise at the Peak of Serenity. We will not allow them to do so again! We have trained hard, but we need weapons capable of destroying this great evil if we are to have any chance of success. Our scrolls speak of several weapons that should prove suitable, but we are unable to decide which one to pursue first. The choice, Grand Master, is yours. 
Speak with Thaedris Feathersong in Tel'anor.	Bad Intentions	Suramar is lost. Our leaders struck a dark bargain, accepting the Legion as our allies. We were meant to be heroes, guardians - the people resting here. We are not like them any more. I cannot live with them. But cut off from the Nightwell, we wither and devolve into a mindless existence. An existence without release or dignity, as you can see even here...I rejected both of these options and found myself here. I will find a third way. 
Enter the Illidari Gateway to board the Fel Hammer in Mardum.	Return to Mardum	The gateway is fully functional, George. Ooh, I am positively tingling with excitement! Do let Jace and the others know that we eagerly await your arrival. There's so much to do and ever so little time. You will be joining us aboard, won't you? 
	Ancient Guidance	 
Escort King Anduin to Soul Ruin at the Broken Shore.	A Walk to Remember	It's good to have you at my side, George. I've come to the Broken Shore to see, for myself, the price that my father... that the Alliance has paid to protect our world. As long as I am blind to the suffering and sacrifices of my people, I will never be able to lead them to peace. Time is short, we should move onward. 
Speak with Danath Trollbane at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran.	An Important Mission	Champion! I bear an urgent message from Danath Trollbane. He requests that you join him at Krasus' Landing. He has an urgent mission that requires your expertise! 
Speak with Nobundo and take your place as the head of the Earthen Ring.	A Ring Reforged	Speak with Nobundo, and take your place around the circle, George. The Earthen Ring will rise again, with you as its leader! Within these stones stands the legendary Heart of Azeroth, which we can use as a base of operations. Perhaps the power of your artifact can unseal the hidden chambers... 
Walk with High Exarch Turalyon.	From Darkness	I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before our presence is known. We must begin our preparations at once. 
	Experimental Potion: Test Subjects Needed	 
Deliver the Vault Ticket to Marin Noggenfogger.	A Ticket for Marin	This Vault Ticket should be delivered to Marin Noggenfogger. 
	Warden Tower Assault: Nightwatcher's Perch	 
	Raft Fishing	 
Meet with Angler Creel in Whitewater Wash.	The Flow of the River	We can leave Farmer Maya in charge of the farmland now that the greatest threat has been reduced. But we aren't out of hot water just yet, George. The fisheries are just as important as our fields, and they are in even greater danger than the farm if what Angler Creel says is true. 
Find and aid the spirit of Huln Highmountain.	Titanic Showdown	The tale of Huln did not end with him acquiring the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. No. For that part, we must venture deeper into this cavern. A final brazier awaits us ahead. Come, let us see what happened next. 
Scout out the key locations in Coldarra.	Eyes of the Dragon	You should travel at once to Coldarra in Borean Tundra, George. There, I would recommend you scout out a few key locations and report back to me. I know the area well, and should be able to tell you how to proceed. Make haste! 
Obtain the books that Sythorne requests, then help him defeat the challenges within.	Study Hall: Combat Research	What's this? A new, confused student, desperately trying to win the favor of the headmistress, wandering the halls without anything to do? Perfect! I need help with my research. I'm writing a paper on combat. Grab me some books from the shelf over there. 
Close 3 Legion Portals.	Flanking Maneuvers	I will take command of Fareeya's lieutenants and we will escort Velen to the Crest of Knowledge. His mission must not fail. We face an old foe-- one the Army of the Light has encountered on numerous occasions. Talgath will try to block us in and prevent our retreat. You must not let that happen. Find out how he is bringing in his forces and cut them off. All we need is time to get in and get out. We are counting on you. 
Complete the construction of the Command Center.	The Command Center	Well done George. In testament to the efforts of all forces fighting here, we have come together to complete the construction of the Command Center. All that remains is for you to inspect our work, and complete the construction. 
Meet with Lorna Crowley outside of Hrydshal to begin the trial of the Thorignir.	Will of the Thorignir	In the summit of storms the dragons await. Born of the gods, they will test your will. They roost above Hrydshal, where their children serve the Drekirjar. But they are no allies to man or vrykul, and so you must earn their blessing as they see fit. A friend of yours awaits in Hrydshal, no doubt searching for the answers you now possess. Go to her, and together, you will test your might against the storm! 
Meet Thorim at the Temple of Storms.	Homeward Bound	The reformation procedure went positively flawlessly! Most excellent results indeed--and plenty of data to analyze! I'm not sure what it is Thorim has to show you, but I suggest you get to the Temple of Storms right away. He gets a bit destructive when he's kept waiting. Take my teleporter pad directly out of Ulduar. I'm afraid the normal route to the entrance is... inoperable at the moment. 
Deal with Magnar Icebreaker.	Legacy of the Icebreaker	The greatest warrior should wield the greatest weapons. Long ago a great king, Magnar Icebreaker, wielded weapons crafted from a scale of the mightiest dragon in the land. He should be here, but he is not. Instead he languishes in his tomb. His son, Hruthnir, is here. He will lead you to the tomb. If Magnar can be saved, do so. Either way, return with his weapons. 
	Herald of Chaos	 
Speak to Skylord Omnuron	An Urgent Warning	<The soldier is wan and wounded, obviously in tremendous pain.>Been held prisoner... since the assault on... the Broken Shore...<They shudder.>The demons... th-they are gathering... preparing...Had to escape... to warn you. They must... be stopped! 
Slay Iskhaneth and Tyndrissen.	Leyline Abuse	These monsters are pulling mana directly out of the ground. This explains why not even my mana pools can dull my pain. I worry about my brood. Without the power of the ley lines, we are nothing. At this rate, I may not even be able to help you with your Tidestone. Look for their mana siphons, and punish the cowardly nightfallen elves that are using them. 
Release 6 7th Legion Dragoons from static fields.	Pins and Needles	Hngghh! Nope, can't stand yet. It's all pins and needles. Small fries like this are usually no problem for the 7th, but we weren't prepared for their electrical attacks. Before I knew it, I was trapped in some kind of static field. Couldn't move a muscle until you came along. My comrades were carried deeper into the cave. Get 'em out before they become whelp chow! 
	Size Doesn't Matter	 
Assist Mimiron.	The Creator's Workshop	My remote observation relay captured an astonishing amount of data from that tomb. If we can download its memory to my core processing systems, I should be able to locate Titanstrike... and that unsavory vrykul who took it. Since you're here, would you mind helping out? Processing that much information might overload a few failsafe mechanisms here and there, and I know you're the capable sort! 
Speak to Tactician Tinderfell in the Trueshot Lodge.	Tactical Matters	Now that your artifact is ready, it's time to plan your first strike against the Legion. Speak to Tactician Tinderfell, our expert on such matters. 
Rescue 10 Darkfallen Slaves from the Annihilan Pits.	Prisoners No More	Hatuun's people have endured arduous times. Their numbers dwindle as those ripped from beyond the walls of their sanctuary become servants to the annihilan lords in the pits just beyond, sentenced to a life of labor, torture and ultimately, death. Seek out these captives, release them from their bonds and show our allies we stand as one against the Burning Legion. 
Reignite the 3 demon wards.	Reignite the Wards	The demons are weakening my defenses. They must be far more powerful than what we've faced before. Will you help me to reignite the wards to keep the Legion from overrunning our position here? 
	The Master of Pets	 
Escape from Dreadscar Rift.	Into the Mouth of the Nether	With the ritual failed and the council scattered, you find yourself trapped in the prison of the pit lord, Jagganoth. The situation is grim, but with the help of the remaining council members, you may be able to escape. 
Rescue Ailen Astravar.	Thinly Veiled Threats	How could I let this happen?<Aurore wrings her hands.>Yesterday Coryn Stelleris approached me about the appointment. He sought my support, but I did not offer it. He said my son's life would continue as normal... if I gave him my vote. This morning my son was gone. I can only think of the terrible things he may be suffering. You know what this family is capable of! You want my support, but I can do nothing while my son is in danger. Nothing. Please... save him! 
Slay Ael'Yith.	The Nightborne Prince	<Senegos is focused.>I sense it now. In the ruined building, to the east. One of these cretins must have tapped deep into the ley line. I suspect he will be heavily defended, George. Once again, the well-being of my brood is in your hands. 
Bring Sigryn before Eyir in Skold-Ashil.	The Reluctant Queen	Wait, how is it you know about my parentage? Be careful what you say around here, there are those who would hunt me down if they knew my bloodline. I don't know who you are, nor do I believe I'm part of any prophecy. However, if you seek to undo the damage my father has wrought on the Tideskorn, then I feel obliged to assist you. Meet me in Valdisdall, Mechanic. From there we can make our way to Skold-Ashil and request an audience with Eyir. Perhaps she can shed some light on this prophecy. 
Slay 8 Crawliac Harpies and 6 Skywhisker Loyalists in the Haglands.	Assaulting the Haglands	Proceed on foot into the Haglands and slay any harpies you find. Quell their numbers! We will provide air support and force your prey to the ground where you can deal with them. Show these witches the fury of your... well... your ""you."" 
Slay 10 Diseased Grubs and 3 Overgrown Larva at Earthmother's Bounty.	Infestation	Those bugs are destroying our crops and attack any of us who get near them. Would you exterminate some of those vile creatures? 
Meet Jale Rivermane at Lifespring Cavern.	Lifespring Cavern	The drogbar have taken over my cavern. It is where we Rivermane practice our water magic and get much of the purest healing water in Highmountain. Meet me there and we will cleanse that sacred place of these dark-dwellers. 
Perform the ritual to commune with the Skull of the Man'ari and convince it to tell you its location.	Looking into the Darkness	Friend now is ready to perform the ritual! Remember, friend, the skull must be convinced that it is in its best interest to be in your possession. If we must force the skull into your servitude, it would be far weaker. 
Speak with Oculeth in Shal'Aran.	Telemantic Expanse	Understanding fel magic alone may not be enough, George. Speak with Oculeth about diversifying our efforts. I hear he's got something... unique planned for us. 
Speak with the krokul beneath Oranaar.	Beneath Oronaar	The krokul we found beneath Oranaar did not wish to leave. Could you speak with him, George? Convince him to board the Vindicaar. 
Mindmeld with Murky and defeat Clawdayshus.	Oh, the Clawdacity!	The leader of the Cavemoss makrura, Clawdayshus, has been ordering raids into the Cavemoss village to steal the young for snacks. This isn't going to do at all. In order to prove their power, Murky and the tadpoles must destroy him as well! This is a job for murlocs. Mindmeld with Murky in his egg and show him how it's done! 
Speak with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection: Missing Persons	First Arcanist Thalyssra has requested your aid in searching for her missing people. She has a lead from a very unexpected ally. Meet with her at Shal'Aran in Suramar. 
Free 6 Demon Hunters from Soul Harvesters.	Fel Machinations	My force wiped out the demons' forward base here. But, an imp mother and her brood took the rest of my demon hunters hostage, including Cyana Nightglaive. We need to free the Illidari and destroy the Burning Legion. 
Meet Karam Magespear at Felbreach Hollow in the Broken Shore.	Where it's Thinnest	Though I have never heard of this ""Nethersworn"" cult, what this manifesto speaks of can't be good. I do have a theory, however. The writing speaks of ""the place its skin is thinnest."" I think they might be referring to the place where the veil between Azeroth and the Twisting Nether is weakest - the Tomb of Sargeras. With our forces having established a foothold at the Broken Shore, this would be an opportune time for Raest and his cultist allies to reach the tomb. I would suggest you stop them. 
Find Razik Gazbolt at Icepine Point.	Procuring a Prototype	If Addie's going to be a more permanent member of the huntin' party, then she'll need some specialty gear for someone her size. My munitions expert should have some ideas about what kind of weapon would best suit a gnome. Stop by his camp and let him know that I'll be needin' a prototype soon. 
Find Hemet Nesingwary at his Highmountain retreat.	Rating Razik	Hemet is expecting an update on how my munitions research and development is going. I'm sure you'll be happy to tell my boss that my latest creation worked flawlessly! You can find him at his camp near the hunters' lodge. 
	Help on the Way	 
Seek Mythandros at Irongrove Retreat.	Return to Irongrove Retreat	We have three blessings from the creatures we share this land with. Combined with a blessing from Elune, the moonwell will watch over this land for years to come. Meet Mythandros at the retreat. I am sure he would like to include you in the ritual. 
Use Vishax's Portal.	Commander on Deck!	<The device hums to life, ready to provide you with access to Squadron Commander Vishax's portal in the Antoran Wastes.> 
	Intact Demon Eyes	 
Bring the Fel-Ravaged Tome to Robert Newhearth in Dalaran.	Fel-Ravaged Tome	Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire. The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills. Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility. 
	Gorgroth	 
Find Naralex deep within the Tel'Andu Barrow Den.	Join the Dreamer	I'm afraid I can't really help you actually enter the Emerald Dream - we dryads merely shift our bodies between the planes. That's ok, though - Naralex has offered to help! Go to the very bottom of the Tel'Andu Barrow Den. Naralex is already there setting things up for you. 
Return to Chieftain Hatuun in Krokul Hovel.	Woah, Nelly!	George, you have my thanks. My Wranglers should be able to take it from here. If I can ask one more favor, would you pass a message to Chieftain Hatuun? Tell him the forest is secure once again. I'm sure he will reward you for all of your effort. I'll loan you one of my fastest Cragscalers for the trip. Make sure to look both ways before crossing that path outside this forest, there's a giant Legion Obliterator that patrols there. Good luck! 
Witness Velen's memory.	What Might Have Been	<Velen continues to stare at the statue as he speaks.>Thousands of years ago, when I was young, I made a choice. A choice that allowed my world to fall to ruin. A choice that made my people exiles. A choice that forever separated me from my beloved brothers.<Velen shakes his head.>I cannot leave, not yet. Not until I have had a chance to reflect. 
Ask around the city for information on Levia Laurence.	Outlaw: The Folly of Levia Laurence	Levia Laurence was once a member of the Kirin Tor. Dabbling in shadow magic got her banned from the city, but she knows the streets too well to keep her out for good. Levia has disappeared, and I'm gravely concerned. Her work may have attracted the attention of the Legion. It has before. It would be very dangerous if her knowledge fell into their hands. She was last seen at the Scribe's Sacellum. Ask around there and see if you can pick up her trail.|cFF660000Specialization: Outlaw Rogue|r 
Ensure that all of the kobold jobs are done.	Burn the Candle at Both Ends	Why you come back already? Have to wait until jobs are done or I no let you through! Go back to Throne of Ordering Around and make sure they finish! 
	Unethical Adventurers	 
Take your seat in the Council of Shadows.	The Final Shadow	You walk in the halls of the Uncrowned. We are the slayers of kings, the downfall of empires, the unseen blades that write the true history of this world. Seated before you are the Shadows, the council which aims the blades of the Uncrowned wherever our will demands. We have brought you here today with an offer. Take your seat as the final Shadow and help us lead the Uncrowned. What do you say? 
Activate the teleporter pad and bring Vanthir's gift to Thalyssra.	Wasted Potential	You have done well for us here, but it is time for you to return to Thalyssra. There is a teleporter pad nearby that has gone unused in recent years. See if you can reroute it and return to her that way. Oh, and before you go:<Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of Arcwine.>Take this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child. We are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now. 
Slay Conjurer Thalerian and acquire the Astromancer's Keystone.	The Orchestrator of Our Demise	Conjurer Thalerian must be stopped. He immediately sought out my father's private study when he arrived and he has not yet emerged. I worry that he may have found a very dangerous item. It is called the Astromancer's Keystone. It is used to manipulate the stronghold's defenses. Such magic was meant to protect the Moon Guard- used for any other purpose and it becomes unspeakably destructive. Retrieve the Keystone. Slay Conjurer Thalerian to get it, if you must. 
Search for the object the Monkey King has described in his riddle.	The Riddle of Purity	Do you seek my weapon? Then you better answer my question. ""I seek something curvy and bendy but with no spine, It rushes and rushes leaving chaos behind. Sometimes it brings life, sometimes it brings death: A little is good, but a lot steals your breath. It's as common as dirt, but this part's obscure: This stuff comes from a pool that's known to be pure.""Bring me what I seek. 
Collect the Forsaken Scouting Orders from Dread-Rider Stalkers and Dread-Rider Plaguebringers near Greywatch.	Whispers from the Dark	We still have little knowledge of the Horde's activities in the region, but I'm hoping you can help change that. Lately the woods have been crawling with Sylvanas' agents. The few we have taken out carried orders from her Dark Rangers, who are no doubt in command of her forces here. While you're on the hunt, keep an eye out for any scouting orders. They may help us pinpoint Sylvanas' objective in the area. 
	Bastion of Bradensbrook	 
Collect 10 Argunite Crystals.	Crystals Not Included	Turalyon is safe, and we can start to fight back. First things first, we must secure what supplies we can from the crash. Even though we are blessed by the Light, our ships still rely on crystal technology. From powering our defenses to arming our weapons, we will need to collect as much as we can to fight back against the enemy. Venture out into the crash and retrieve what crystals you can. While you are out there, keep an eye out for Y'mera. She was separated from us, and will need help. 
Return to the Vindicaar.	Return to the Vindicaar	That pit lord won't trouble our new allies any longer.<Turalyon's brow furrows.>Until another takes its place, at least. If there's one thing I've learned in our endless war against the Legion, it's to savor victories as you find them. Come, let us take a moment to regroup back at your vessel. Alleria and I have been waiting a long time for a reunion with our son. 
	DANGER: Aegir Wavecrusher	 
	Oh, Ship!	 
Follow Fhambar to Levia's location.	Following the Scent	You will have to continue through the portal without me, Mechanic. I have assisted you in locating your mage's whereabouts, so I consider my debt to Modera paid. However, I will lend you one of my felhounds to help track this mage down. If she is as powerful as Modera says, then it would be in everyone's best interest that Agatha not be allowed to keep her. Best of luck, Mechanic, and try to bring Fhambar back in one piece. 
Return to Archmage Kalec in Dalaran.	A Portal Away	Xylem may have escaped, but a trace of his portal remains. Now that you have freed his apprentices from his corruption, I will set them to work trying to find a way to reach him. Once I find something, I will alert the Kirin Tor. I only ask that when you do confront the Archmage, that you try to spare his life. I believe that the good man he once was still exists beneath the shadow that has taken him. Farewell, George. 
Follow Sylvanas into the Vault of Eyir.	A New Life for Undeath	It seems that you are full of surprises, George. With the blessing of the Valkyra queen, you have opened a path that will shape the destiny of Azeroth. I invite you to bear witness, for today a new day dawns on the Forsaken! 
Imbue a relic with Netherlight Fortification using the Netherlight Crucible.	The Netherlight Crucible	The crucible thrums with power. Soon our weapons will shine like the stars themselves! We will need that strength if we are to have any hope of defeating the Legion here. George, you have endured great hardship to bring us to this moment. The honor of first tapping the crucible's power must be yours. 
	WANTED: Kiranys Duskwhisper	 
Repel the Burning Legion forces throughout Val'sharah.	Assault on Val'sharah	The Legion's moves across our lands. Find their forces and remove the threat before it is too late! 
Destroy the three Soul Coffers on the Shattered Fields.	A Grim Equation	They were waiting for us when we crashed. It was all we could do to establish our small outpost. Even now they drain the souls of our fallen to fuel their attacks. Destroy their soul coffers. Free our comrades and let them join the Light. When you have finished, find Y'mera in the field. She has been sorely missed, but she will not have fallen. Of this I am certain. 
Enter the academy's west wing.	The Haunted Halls	Now, what was it you wanted? You're here to see the Tidestone of Golganneth? Hah! Ho ho ha ha haa! Hooo my. No, only the academy's headmistress has the keys to that chamber, and she hasn't opened the door in... oh, I'd say about ten thousand years. You'd best be off to class, now. Go on, then! Into the west wing with you! 
Search for the objects the Monkey King has described in his riddle.	The Riddle of the Barrel	My weapon is great when in a fight,It's even handy when you sit for a bite. My favorite flask I've tied on it, hanging from a cord,The brews within are some of the best that I've ever scored. If you truly seek my weapon then bring me something nice to put into my belly,A powerful brew is what I want, something strong and smelly. 
Collect 6 Driftwood in Azuregale Bay and build a funeral pyre for Jarl Throndyr.	Beach Bonfire	Do not let... my body lie in... the mud. Set my flesh... aflame. 
Kill 10 panthara within the Petrified Forest.	Duskcloak Problem	Here in this forest, species of talbuk and panthara still roam. However, the balance has been disrupted and now the panthara risk hunting the talbuk to extinction. To ensure their survival, we must decrease the number of panthara. Do not let their suffering linger. A swift death is the most merciful. 
Meet Lord Maxwell Tyrosus at Light's Hope Chapel.	Hope Prevails	Tirion... still alive! We have to save him. Light's Hope Chapel is not far from here. We must rally our forces and leave at once for the Broken Shore. 
Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey the Terrace of Order in Suramar City.	Survey the City	Never a dull moment! Well... perhaps this is not entirely true. I'm afraid I must ask you once more to return to the city to gather information. But this is not just any information - this is information extraction! I require specific coordinates to allow me to focus my teleportations with extreme accuracy. It will, unfortunately, take a bit of time to dig through the information once retrieved, but no matter. We have plenty else to do in the meantime. 
	Freeing the Taken	 
Kill 12 demons.	Overwhelming Power	We will find no sanctuary on this world. Even now the full might of the Burning Legion rises to defend Argus. The siege camp below overflows with demon filth that stand between us and the weapon trained on the Vindicaar. They must be dealt with before it can fully charge, or Argus will be our grave. 
Defend Arluin's stash from the city guards.	Asset Security	With the demons and guards so agitated, I'm running out of safe places to store contraband. The guards have caught on to one of my favorite havens and will be making off with my goods any minute now. Head to my stash and discourage their curiosity. You will need to use a grappling hook to access it- just look for something to latch onto along the ledge. I will make sure there is something in it for you when you are done. 
	Investigation at Mak'rana	 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller in Dreadwake's Landing.	The Dark Lady's Bidding	Uh, are these guys friendlies? I guess it's a good sign they haven't tried to eat Duchess... yet. Anyway, I have orders. Nathanos caught up with the dark rangers, who were sent forward aboard the Oblivion on a secret mission from Lady Sylvanas herself! Unfortunately the Alliance caught wind of our plan, and now Greymane is attacking the outpost! We could really use you over there, George. Duchess can take you there, just give me the word. 
Collect 30 Partially Digested Arcana.	Invasive Species	We should seek out an alternate source of energy just in case I am wrong about the conduits. Luckily enough, I think I know where we can find one. The panthara native to Argus are solitary creatures, but it seems whatever magic the Wakeners possessed has drawn them here in great numbers. This is no time to be gentle with the environment--panthara devour energy to survive. Slay them and see if you cannot reclaim some of the power they have consumed. 
Use the Scrying Orb to determine potential locations of night elf spirits, then go rescue them.	Back from the Dead	<Olothil sighs.>My sister tries my patience sometimes. No matter. I've identified a few locations that our parents might be. I shall search in this area with Kallistia. You've already helped us so much... would you help us look to the east? You can use my scrying orb to see the locations that our ritual has uncovered. 
Travel to Xylem's Tower within Bear's Head in Azshara.	Survival: The Thieving Apprentice	The Focusing Iris has been stolen from the Dalaran Vaults! The thief was a mage of some skill, but we've been unable to track him. Fortunately, the thief dropped a note from his master, addressing him as one of his ""apprentici."" I know of only one mage who uses that particular pluralization - Archmage Xylem. I'll need you to investigate. In Azshara you will find his tower where he trains his apprentices. Go there, and see what Xylem is up to.|cFF660000Specialization: Survival Hunter|r 
	Jed'hin Tournament	 
Meet with First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.	Insurrection: Elisande's Retort	The combined forces of the elves stand ready to begin their siege on the gates of the Nighthold. Report to First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran to begin the siege. 
Locate the missing 7th Legion Dragoons.	The Lost Legion	The heroic men and women of the 7th Legion stayed at the front of the ship to fight off storm drakes while the crew evacuated. None of them have returned. Please find them, $p! 
Find Prophet Velen in Dalaran.	Confirming Suspicions	That heart is the last remaining piece of Highlord Kruul - once one of the Legion's best warlords. Many years ago Kruul's armies nearly descended upon the Dark Portal to crush the Azerothian assault on Outland. We Illidari intercepted before he could strike. I fear that the Legion aims to use the heart to hasten Kruul's resurrection in the nether. We must find the Prophet Velen at once - only he can tell us for sure. 
Go to Bradensbrook in Val'sharah.	Holy: The Bradensbrook Investigation	We have uncovered forged orders from the Shore. They have a fel influence about them. They guide the reader to believe they are legitimate. It orders Black Rook Hold to attack a ""demonic enclave"" just south of their walls. There's only one enclave they could be talking about, Bradensbrook! Is it possible these would be able to convince the undead to attack Bradensbrook? You should head there immediately and either warn them, or render aid.|cFF660000Specialization: Holy Priest|r 
Assassinate Cade Shadowgaze at the Altar of Storms in Blasted Lands and search his body for information.	Finishing the Job	Garona set out to assassinate the leaders of a Legion cult some time ago. We haven't heard from her since. To make matters worse, she took the Kingslayers with her. She knows they bring out the worst in her! Your best bet to find Garona is by continuing her work. Our intel points to a warlock by the name of Caden Shadowgaze inducting new recruits at the Altar of Storms in Blasted Lands. See if he has anything useful in his pockets. Once he's dead, I mean. 
Return to Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail.	The Day is Won	The majority of our warriors survived and we have the Alliance's Azerite and weapons. Be proud of yourself, George. You fought with honor today. Go and inform Nathanos of our victory here. The Azerite should reach them shortly. 
Gather Echoes of Mortality from living creatures.	The Eternal Traveler	Hail, mortal. For untold ages, my kind has traversed the myriad realms of reality. We have beheld phenomena that you cannot begin to comprehend. But there is much you must learn of what awaits you on the horizon. The power of Death is on the rise. The veil weakens between your world and the Shadowlands. When a mortal life expires, an echo of it remains behind. The most powerful mortals leave the most resonant echoes. Bring these to me, that I might study them... to both our benefits. 
Attend the council meeting at Unity Square.	A Nation United	You've done a fine job here, $p. With the city secure and Jaina in command of the fleet, the time has come for Kul Tiras to formally join the Alliance. King Anduin has already departed for Unity Square to meet with Jaina, Katherine and the heads of the major Kul Tiran houses. They are waiting for you. 
Return to Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption.	War Marches On	I hope the Horde will think twice about attacking Kul Tiras in the future, but given the actions of its leadership, it is a faint hope at best. Still, what matters most is my people are safe now. The fleet and marines should be here soon to help the Outriggers clear out what remains of the Horde forces. Please return to High Commander Wyrmbane and let him know I will join everyone as soon as I am able. Thank you for your swift actions today, George. 
	Uniting Kul Tiras	 
Meet Gazlowe at the Abandoned Junkheap in Tiragarde Sound.	The Legend of Mechagon	Heya, $p. I was just tellin' Skaggit that I was hoping I'd run into you up here! I caught wind of an Alliance operation into some old vault that opened in Tiragarde Sound. In typical gnomish fashion, Tinkmaster Overspark is overreacting like crazy, claiming it's some lost connection to the gnome fairytale land of Mechagon.<Gazlowe scoffs.>I don't buy that for a second, but I am very interested in getting my hands on whatever tech's in that vault. You in?

I was just about to send for you.<Upon opening it, the letter reads as follows.>""George,You have helped to unite the Kul Tirans and gained their support for the Alliance. Perhaps now you might be able to help reunite a mother with her daughter. Meet me at the family memorial by Proudmoore Keep.

Enter Mechagon and defeat King Mechagon.	Operation: Mechagon - The Mechoriginator	My father's madness won't be contained to this island. King Mechagon is creating a massive device capable of reversing the Curse of Flesh across the entirety of Azeroth! Any races forged by the Titans will return to their original state. For us gnomes, that means fully mechanical. For dwarves and troggs, stone. Vrykul, iron. The list goes on, but most races aren't even ON the list. Anything not forged by the titans will be completely obliterated. We must stop King Mechagon before it's too late!

Come to Boralus Harbor and meet with me upon the Wind's Redemption with all haste! 
Retrieve the Corrupt Black Dragonscale from Blackwing Descent atop Blackrock Mountain in Burning Steppes.	Beginning the Descent	Protecting one's mind against the old gods requires an object of pure corruption. Unbeknownst to many, one such object exists--dormant beneath the molten pits of Blackwing Descent. Until recently, one of my agents stood watch over the area, keeping detailed records of suspicious activities. Unfortunately, this agent has gone silent. It is now clear we are not the only ones with this knowledge. If we are to find answers, there is one place to look. Our journey continues, George. Blackrock awaits. 
Take the SI:7 report to Lady Jaina	The Calm Before	A word, George. There was a raid on the Norwington Estate, where we were testing some new designs of Azerite systems. Lady Jaina asked SI:7 to look into the matter. I have the report here. I know the Proudmoore family wants a moment together before they're pulled apart again, but the war is still ongoing. You have been a friend to her family. Take the report to Jaina. I believe they went to pay respects at the family memorial. 
Find Nisha's wagon and ride it to safety.	An Explosive Exit	Alright, $p. I think it's time we make a run for it. Hopefully my wagon's still nearby. I'll steer us to our hideaway. I just need you to lob explosives onto any sethrak who are brave enough to follow us. 
Complete an Assault in Uldum.	Surfacing Threats	The tol'vir take the protection of the titans' constructs here in Uldum as a sacred duty. However, our numbers have dwindled, and we face greater threats with each day. Even with the strength of our new allies, we will only be able to hold these enemies back for so long. Should any of them surge in power, they may still be able to overwhelm us and endanger the forge. This is where your assistance is needed. Speak to High Commander Kamses to assess our current situation. 
	The Soulbinder	 
Ride back to Zuldazar with Hexlord Raal.	Fly Out to Meet Them	De Alliance scum will pay for dis! Our army is moving as fast as it can to defend our city. Ride with Raal to get back to de entrance to our city. We must stop de Alliance! 
Collect a set of scrolls depicting the tortollan pilgrimage.	The Great Sea Scrolls	<Dust falls from the scroll case as you retrieve it, revealing an ornate etching. The artwork, rendered with obvious care and skill, depicts a scene from a tortollan pilgrimage. The container has spaces for twelve rolled scrolls, only one of which is occupied. A complete set would likely be quite valuable to a tortollan collector.> 
Inspect the Scouting Map in the Harbormaster's Office.	A Nation Divided	Kul Tiras must be unified before it can be of any help to the Alliance. Let's get you briefed on the current situation in each of our major territories. Then you can take a look at the map behind me and make the call on where you want to go first.

Complete the Zandalar Forever scenario.	Zandalar Forever!	Bwonsamdi has whispered a warning to me: the enemy is on the move.

Are you ready to defend Zandalar? 
Meet with Tinkmaster Overspark in Boralus.	Fame Waits for Gnome One	Tinkmaster Overspark requests your assistance on an important research expedition. Working with the esteemed Tinkmaster will certainly be of benefit to your career. It's done wonders for mine! 
Discover a clue about the island's history.	Clues Abound	Before King Mechagon claimed this island, someone else lived here. Buried beneath this filth and garbage is the history of a forgotten people. With your help, we shall learn about these previous inhabitants. Sir Finley has marked a location where he's seen unusual artifacts. Meet him there and see if you can discover any clues. 
Mount the Stolen Horse, then use it to round up 10 Bridgeport Guards and Captain Stone. Then escort them to the southwest corner of town. Getting knocked off of your horse could prove fatal, and will fail the mission.	The Bridgeport Ride	Pay attention, George, because this isn't going to be our standard assassination mission. You and I are going to take this horse through Bridgeport and... cause a scene. I want every single guard on our tail, along with that Captain Stone character. Once we've rounded them up, it's over to those explosives, and...<Lilian's eyes grow wide with delight.>Boom. 
Complete ""Escape from Tol Dagor"".	Through the Front Door	We would like the least amount of risk during your retrieval of Priscilla Ashvane. You will arrive on the docks during a shift change. From there, you will prepare and enter the prison. Find me in Zuldazar when you are successful.

Complete any 4 world quests in Tiragarde Sound.	Proudmoore Admiralty	Assist the Proudmoore Admiralty by completing 4 world quests. 
Meet Keeshan within the Collapsed Tunnels in Nazmir.	Target: Blood Prince Dreven	We must kill Blood Prince Dreven and his followers. I know of the place where they intend to go. Here is the plan. You and Keeshan will make your way to the tunnels and act as bait, lure Dreven into a false sense of security. Myself and the sentinels will seal the entrance to trap him and his allies shortly thereafter. Then we kill them all. I'll send word to the others to get moving. Let's go. 
Follow the secret passage within Mogu'shan Palace and re-activate the Engine of Nalak'sha.	The Engine of Nalak'sha	Your kind have proved me wrong in the past, so I will give you a chance to do so again. The titan structure which houses the Engine of Nalak'sha spans the entirety of Pandaria. There are more ways to reach it than just the Mogu'shan Vaults. There are many such routes, but the closest would be through Mogu'shan Palace. The chambers beneath the palace are interconnected with the vaults. Seek your fate there, champion. 
Meet Shandris Feathermoon on the deck of Gral's Call.	An End to the Killing	Let's return to the upper decks and see what our current status is. Shandris should be there by now. I know Shandris and Falstad well enough that they will be there with the captain of this ship, dead or alive. 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on The Banshee's Wail.	The Warchief's Order	Champion, the Dark Lady summons you. The time has come to set her plan into motion. Our warships are ready to embark. The key to victory over the Alliance is within our grasp. Meet me in Zuldazar, aboard the Banshee's Wail. What we do next... we do for the Horde. 
Get three treasure hunters to help you.	All Laid Out For Us	<This is all the treasure Calico McGee's found so far. Packed up and ready to move out. More like all laid out for you to take! You'll need a few extra hands to carry this much loot. There should be some Treasure Hunters from Deadwash around. Ask Big Find Balor, Toothless Eddard, and Chopper Darry to help.> 
Collect a Mogu Scouting Report from mogu in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Finding the Rajani	Now that we have an idea of who we're looking for, the next question is, where can we find them? With the constant infighting of the mogu, it is likely that each clan would keep tabs on the whereabouts of their competitors. If we can find such information, it may just lead us to the Rajani. Seek out the champions of the mogu. They would be the most likely to carry reports on their enemies' whereabouts. 
Assist Nathanos Blightcaller in retrieving Valentine's body.	What Remains of Marshal M. Valentine	We have the key. We found the crypt. Next, Valentine's body shall be ours. No need to wait for Lilian and Stone. Let's finish this now. 
Speak with Sylvanas Windrunner aboard the Banshee's Wail in Zuldazar.	Our War Continues	The work to stop the Alliance is far from over, George. But thanks to you, we have the methods necessary to break them. The Abyssal Scepter has been delivered to King Rastakhan, earning us more of his favor. There is a matter of greater importance that I would speak to you about... but not here. Meet me aboard the Banshee's Wail within Zuldazar. 
Collect a Satchel of Seaweed, a Bundle of Vellum, and some Seal Blubber from around Anglepoint Wharf.	Aiding the Wharf	We have read the tides, and never before have I seen them in such turmoil. They call to the tidesages, begging for help. A debilitating sickness is running rampant amongst the villagers, and it comes from the sea. We are but few. There is only so much we can do! Please, take this list and gather the listed reagents from around the pier while I attempt to calm these folks. I should be able to create a tonic that will help. I hope. 
	The Blood Gate	 
Activate the Elemental Essence Amalgamator in Mardivas's Laboratory.	The Laboratory of Mardivas	<Several pages are devoted to notes on an experiment, a hastily written journal entry follows.>At last, my research into the base elements has begun to bear fruit! With careful application of the right base reagents and some arcane power I've managed to combine the essence of the elements in such a way as to create life! Further investigation will be needed to determine what the various mixes of the elements will yield.<The writing ends here.> 
Mobilize the Zandalari fleet, warriors, and flyers.	Ride of the Zandalari	It is time de Alliance see de full fury of de Zandalari. Dey are fools to try an attack in Nazmir. We must tell de fleet, our warriors, and our flyers dat dey must move out and go to Nazmir at once. I will go aid our forces at de Blood Gate. Here is a list of dose you must speak with to mobilize our forces. Move as fast as you can, we must stop de Alliance as quickly as possible. 
Defeat the Amathet forces and reactivate the forge in the Halls of Origination.	The Halls of Origination	It looks like the Halls of Origination have been claimed by a group o' tol'vir calling themselves the Amathet. I don't know much about them other than they're new in town and not the friendliest of types. We'll need tae get in there and re-activate the forge, or else Azeroth will be done for! 
Complete the Siege of Boralus dungeon.	Siege of Boralus: Lady Ashvane's Return	If Ashvane thinks we will sit idly by as she attempts a coup, she is sorely mistaken. The citizens of Boralus will fight her to a man. I'll need you on the front lines to aid them, Mechanic. Go with Taelia to the docks and engage the enemy. With a little luck, we may just make it out of this alive. 
Return to Halford Wyrmbane within Boralus.	He Who Walks in the Light	Shaw reports that Zandalari scouts have been dispatched to alert of our ""full assault"". We did it, George. The Horde and Zandalari will throw their armies at our forces within Nazmir. We cannot let their sacrifice be in vain. We must get back to Boralus and let Halford know it's time to strike. Come, I'll create a portal for us to leave, once we say one final word to Telaamon. 
Defeat Jakra'zet.	Defeat Jakra'zet	Jakra'zet is summoning Mythrax the Unraveler! We cannot allow the ritual to continue. Jakra'zet must be stopped before it's too late! Lead the way, George. We'll be right behind you. Let's go!

Speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth to sail to Vol'dun.	Overseas Assassination	Ready to go to war, George? Mathias Shaw has assembled a list of priority Horde targets, and the first is an influential blood elf by the name of Arlethal Sunwatcher. Intelligence shows that he's the highest ranking member of the Reliquary, an elite blood elf excavation force. He's just standing out in the middle of the desert in Vol'dun, practically begging to be assassinated. Shall we? 
Ride the Ornery Battleboar out of Briarback Kraul and report to Mayor Roz.	A Question of Quillpower	I can't believe you managed to kill that thing. You're quite impressive, you know that? Either way, we should be getting back to Roz with our report. We're stuck in the middle of the kraul, surrounded by angry quilboar. But I have a plan! Some of the boars seem reasonable enough. I gave them a bit of my rations and they've been following me around. I bet we can use them to hitch a ride out of this place. You in? 
Enter the Tol Dagor dungeon, recover the Ashvane Skeleton Key and kill Overseer Korgus, then return to Flynn Fairwind in the Harbormaster's Office in Boralus.	Tol Dagor: The Fourth Key	Hey, wait a second. I know the type of key our fourth lock needs. This is the same sort of lock the Ashvane company uses. Resists lockpicks like nothing else, but they have a standard skeleton key. There was a set hanging on the wall in the Tol Dagor Armory. Given the state we left it in, it'd be easy to grab it. Taelia and I will take the chest back to the Harbormaster's office for safe keeping. You go in to Tol Dagor and get that last key! 
Return to Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail. Muka Stormbreaker can give you a ride.	Return to Zuldazar	Warfang Hold is our most secured of the footholds we hold in Kul Tiras. Kaga and her forces will be able to keep fortifications running, thanks to you. The Alliance will never see us coming! Tell Nathanos that we have succeeded in our mission. I will help here until I am needed. 
Report to Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar.	A Cycle of Hatred	We have raised new champions for the Horde, established footholds on Kul Tiran soil, and stolen one of their precious artifacts. We hold greater power and sway over our enemies than we have before. Sylvanas has great plans for our Horde, George. I will allow you the pleasure of reporting our victories to her personally.

With one strike we can eliminate what remains of their fleet and rid Azeroth of Blightcaller's filth once and for all! The fleet is preparing to depart, report to the Harbormaster when you are ready to set sail. 
Travel with Meerah's Caravan in search of Julwaba.	Knowledge of the Past	An old friend of mine came to de sands willingly to gain knowledge of de past. If anyone can locate dis weapon, it would be Julwaba. Last I heard, she planned to excavate de ruins surrounding de great pyramid. 
Report back to Halford Wyrmbane in Boralus Harbor.	The Sleeper Agent	Your work here is done, $p. Morton and Megs can take it from here. Head back to Boralus and let Halford know we've secured the weapon. Don't you worry one wink about Grong. Morton and Megs will make sure he's well looked after. 
Speak with King Anduin Wrynn in Stormwind Keep.	An Unwelcome Advisor	<The envelope contains a message from King Anduin Wrynn.>George,Even with the forces of the Horde and Alliance working together, we still have found no trace of N'Zoth's forces. Ever since his release, the Old God has evaded us at every turn. The Light only knows what ill he has in store for Azeroth. Meet me in Stormwind Keep. We must put a plan together to uncover N'Zoth's schemes before it is too late! Light grant you haste,King Anduin Wrynn 
Acquire a Bundle of Dynamite and use it to kill 16 Warfang Miners and 4 Mine Technicians.	Having a Blast	We're going to really hit 'em where it hurts, $p. They're carting tons of black powder right out of that mine. This could end very badly for all of us if we don't do something. The mines are relatively undefended, I bet you can get in and wipe out their workers before they realize what's happening. Keep an eye out for some explosives, if we can use their own tools against them, even better! 
Report to Genn Greymane in Boralus Harbor.	Proudmoore's Parley	So, we meet again. I... apologize for how you were treated last time. I trusted Priscilla like a sister and-- <Katherine chokes up for a moment before regaining her composure.>Let us keep this brief, for I will make no promises nor any formal accords in this state.

Meet Kalecgos at the Nexus and claim the Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect.	A Bolt from the Blue	You have done much to empower the Heart of Azeroth, and I am proud that the dragonflights have lent their strength to your cause. It is now time for the blue dragonflight to do the same. When I first learned of the essences, I knew that some remnant of my dragonflight's power must be out there, coalescing where we were once strong. That is exactly what I have found. The Kirin Tor have isolated its signature at the Nexus, but only the wielder of the Heart of Azeroth can claim it. 
Return to King Rastakhan at Dazar'alor.	False Prophecies	Now dat dis nuisance is out of de way, I can return my focus to de city. Zuldazar has languished while I was away. You should return to Rastakhan. Let de king know dat his will has been carried out and dat dis false prophet is no more. You might think to share Vol'jamba's prophecy with him, if you feel it worth his notice. I cannot say it will change anything at all. 
Use the Prototype Shredder to burn 8 Warfang Buildings and kill General Blackstone and 30 Horde Soldiers.	Eye for an Eye	This is it, $p. Now is the time to strike. Take this shredder and destroy their stronghold. Burn everything to the ground! Show no mercy. They certainly didn't offer any to all of the innocent civilians they slaughtered in Brennadam! 
Return to Boralus and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane.	A Clean Escape	Our victory here will echo through the Horde like a warning shot. Grunts will whisper around the campfire that nowhere is safe from $p and the Alliance. Soldiers will doubt, even for a moment, the strength of their commanders. Sylvanas herself will hear the story of what we did here today, and it will infuriate her. The thought of her outraged roar when she hears the news will keep me warm tonight. Let's return to Boralus and inform the High Commander of the good news. 
Speak with Kalecgos to fly to the Vermillion Redoubt, locate Alexstrasza and discover the source of the threat.	In the Shadow of Crimson Wings	It is unlike Alexstrasza to remain out of contact for so long, particularly when the very essences of the dragonflights' power are being made manifest. While our allies here tend to the injured, we must seek out the Life-Binder at once. When you are ready, we shall ride to the Vermillion Redoubt together. 
Defeat Emperor Korthek.	The Fall of Emperor Korthek	Korthek finally approaches. It's been many years since I've faced him in battle. When he first rose to power, I failed my people. I will not falter again. I am prepared to do what must be done. What I should have done long ago. We must kill Korthek and take his key to prevent him, Jakra'zet, or anyone else from ever resurrecting Mythrax. When you are prepared, we will face him together. 
Sail to Tiragarde Sound.	Breaking Kul Tiran Will	Our partnership with the Zandalari will soon be secured. Took a little longer than I expected... but such is the way of things. Unfortunately, the Alliance seems intent on securing a naval force of their own. That can't be allowed to happen. We set sail for Tiragarde Sound when you're ready. 
Seek out a Vision of N'Zoth amidst the corruption in Vale of Eternal Blossoms or Uldum to discover what the future holds for Azeroth.	Descending Into Madness	As unfortunate as the spreading corruption may seem, I believe it provides us the opportunity to prepare for what lies ahead. Locate one of these incursions and see what happens when you peer beyond the dark veil. 
	The Matriarch	 
Slay 15 naga with Bladesman Inowari.	A Tempered Blade	These blades that I wield are newly forged. The time has come to temper them in the blood of my enemies. I have heard that you are skilled in the ways of battle. I too am proficient in the business of death and I would be honored to fight at your side. Accompany me, Mechanic, and together we will spill the blood of our enemies. 
Drive back the N'Zoth Assault in Uldum.	Assault: The Black Empire	It is just as the visions fortold. Dark forces have come to claim the Forge of Origination. They must be stopped, or all of Azeroth will meet its end! 
Fly to the Sanctuary of the Devoted.	Unlikely Allies	I believe this is one of the Keepers' keys! Only Vorrik would know for sure. We need to head to the temple at once. My pterrordax can take us there when you're ready, but we need to hurry. 
Complete any 4 world quests in Nazjatar.	The Unshackled	Assist the Unshackled in Nazjatar by completing 4 world quests. 
Establish your Embassy.	Speaker of the Horde	Your Horde has grown powerful, eclipsing some of de troll empires in its magnitude.

De servants there will answer to you now. Talanji seems excited by whatever she has planned for your people. I look forward to being amused by it later. Zolani can show you a way down dat does not involve falling. 
Help build construction projects.	Cogfrenzy's Construction Frenzy	You Rustbolt resisters inspire me. Tinkering, building, exploring. Letting your imagination run wild and then chasing after it, wherever it leads, with reckless abandon!<Walton releases a deep sigh.>I miss those days. I hope, someday, my conscience will allow me to stay on the surface with you all permanently...Before I return to Mechagon, we must build something incredible. Waren and I have identified a large number of extra construction project sites for today. Build with boldness! 
Go with Lilian Voss to find Thomas Zelling.	To Be Forsaken	Let's move. Zelling is probably with his family now. Either they're happily reunited and he helps us find Valentine... or he just helps us find Valentine. Let's go. 
Return to Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus.	Return to Boralus	Shatterstone Harbor is an expansive foothold, and one that we will use to great advantage against the Horde. I will leave Umbric and the others in charge here. Let's get back to the Wind's Redemption and return to Boralus. 
Meet Brother Therold at Anglepoint Wharf.	Anglepoint Wharf	HELP WANTED. An unidentified illness has cropped up in Anglepoint Wharf. Those experienced with medicine or healing should report to the Therold Wavestone at their earliest convenience. Citizens are advised against visiting Anglepoint on personal business until further notice. Thank you for your cooperation. 
Report to Nathanos Blightcaller aboard the Banshee's Wail in Zuldazar.	The War Campaign	George, a moment of your time. Before you leave the city, speak with me out on the Banshee's Wail, on the docks. I have information to discuss with you about the war against the Alliance.

Meet Maiev Shadowsong and Shandris Feathermoon in Stormwind Keep.	On Whispered Winds	George,I have need of you. Maiev and Shandris are en route to Stormwind to petition King Wrynn for aid in retaking Darkshore. You have proven a loyal ally to my people in times past. I ask that you join their audience with the king and lend your voice to our cause. I suspect we shall meet again soon.-Tyrande 
Honor High Overlord Saurfang.	Old Soldier	No matter what anyone says, he was an honorable orc. A legend in his own right, the ideal to which all warriors of the Horde aspired. He gave his life to heal the rift in the Horde and give us the chance to forge a new path forward. His was more than a death befitting a warrior. It was the death of a hero. We shall honor his sacrifice. 
Meet Nathanos Blightcaller outside Barrowknoll Cemetery. Dread-Admiral Tattersail can bring you to Drustvar.	A Stroll Through a Cemetery	Our next stop is in Drustvar. There, along with some help, we shall identify and extract the body of a Kul Tiran war hero. With his aid, we will learn much of the Kul Tiran fleet. Enough to break it with ease. We shall meet you outside Barrowknoll Cemetery. Do try not to waste time, would you? 
Return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus.	Gallywix Got Away	I must confess my disappointment that we were not able to bring an end to Gallywix's greedy reign today. But I blame no one but myself, and will report the same to the High Commander. Your performance was exemplary, just as I expected. I hope the Alliance will not lose faith in the void elves because of this. We have much to offer. When you're ready, I will open a final Void portal to take us back to Boralus. 
Meet Ji Firepaw at the Orgrimmar Embassy.	The Call for Allies	Greetings, champion! I have been appointed as the Horde's diplomatic ambassador to our allies far and wide.

Follow Warguard Rakera.	Clearing the Fog	Did you lead Kaja here? I told her not to come after me. It isn't safe...My mind remains fogged, but de memories are slowly returning. Jakra'zet... de weapon...Come, let us find some fresh air. I will tell you what I've discovered.

Deliver the Visual Holo Sphere to Izira Geasworn in Rustbolt.	Be Kind, Rewind	You exist here due to a time anomaly, but you must return to your own time and help us there.

Meet with Lucille Waycrest at Highroad Pass in Drustvar.	A Slight Detour	If this coven is drawing its power from these ancient ruins, then I may just know of something that could help us fight back. Meet me at the first fork along the Highroad Pass. There is something there I want you to see. 
Protect Zallestrasza while she conducts the ritual.	Life Preserver	The Thornspeakers were assisting me but they have troubles of their own. I came in search of a powerful dragon who fell in battle many centuries ago. Melting snows have revealed Vadekius's final resting place. My Queen has tasked me with ensuring his body cannot be reanimated and enslaved. The ritual will require my full attention and my druid friends aren't fit for combat. Watch my back while I ensure my cousin's soul flies amid the branches of G'Hanir, safe from undeath. 
Return to Zo'bal Ruins and inform Witch Doctor Kejabu as to what happened.	Upward and Onward	It is sad dat Hir'eek had to die, but at least de blood trolls are weaker now. My potions are healing me up nicely. I did some looking around and came across dis guy. He's skittish, but not hostile. I think you can use him to get out of here. Hurry up and jump on, before he breaks de rope! I'll find my own way out; you don't have to worry. 
Question Sister Adrianna, Brother Darrel, and Sister Cecilia for information about the missing fleet.	Searching for Answers	There's a saying Cyrus always said when I was a kid: ""The best face is a friendly one."" It's really helped me get to know the visitors from all over the world that come through Boralus. Let's ask some of the people in charge around here and see if they know anything about the fleet. Maybe it's just a matter of asking nicely! 
	Alpaca It In

Meet Vorrik at Atul'Aman.	Atul'Aman	Jakra'zet and his troops attacked while we were away. Serrik fought well, but it wasn't enough. The keys are gone, and it's only a matter of time before the barrier is broken. Your friends have already given chase. Jakra'zet must not be allowed to resurrect Mythrax the Unraveler. He must be stopped before it's too late! We don't have much time. Meet me at Atul'Aman! We must catch up with Kaja and Rakera and stop the ritual! 
Go into the Shrine of the Storms, recover the Ritual of Safe Passage and defeat Vol'zith the Whisperer.	Shrine of the Storm: The Missing Ritual	The ritual which allows safe passage to Fate's End is a closely guarded secret to keep the curious from venturing there and suffering the same fate as the condemned. I have never conducted it before, but there is a scroll with instructions. It is held in the Shrine of the Storms. To access the scroll, use the staff you have empowered to break the dark energy surrounding it. Collect the Ritual of Safe Passage and bring it to me. 
Deal with Priscilla Ashvane and her minions.	Clearing Out the Cache	<While inspecting the crate, a commotion can be heard within the cavern. A familiar voice, shouting orders.> 
Repel N'Zoth's corruption within the vision.	Vanquishing the Darkness	The darkness grows. The cycle continues. Do what you can to stay N'Zoth's efforts. If we do not stand against the corruption we may some day find ourselves drowning in darkness. 
Ask Ned, Nance Barmy, and Nub Nub about the treasure, then find it.	Missing Treasure!	Which one o' you scurvy dogs dug up me treasure?!Was it you, Ned? I know you was in the Dead Man's Tale when I were talkin' about it! Or maybe it was ol' Nance Barmy, huh? Yer the one what fed me all them drinks in the first place! Oh and don't think I forgot about you, Nub Nub!

Complete any 4 world quests in Drustvar.	Order of Embers	Assist the Order of Embers by completing 4 world quests. 
Find a construction project in Mechagon and help build it.	Collaborative Construction	Construction projects can be found all over the island. You'll be able to build some of 'em yourself, but you're gonna need help with the bigger projects. Ask around and see what others are already working on, or just head out on your own and find a project you're interested in. Construction projects move around and even change day-to-day, so keep an eye out for new ones while you're exploring. If you're ever curious what construction projects are available on a given day, just ask me! 
Help Taelia destroy the pirate ships in Daelin's Gate.	Righteous Retribution	Cyrus taught me how to deal with thugs, bullies, and scum like pirates. When they hit us, we hit back twice as hard.<Taelia's hand finds the haft of her hammer and grips it tight.>It's time to hit back. 
Solve the runic puzzle to activate the Drust Effigy in Gol Inath.	Runic Resistance	Whatever is going on with this effigy, I don't think it's going to open the gateway without our help. These runes must be the key. There must be some way we can use them to activate the effigy. 
Question Brother Alen for information about the missing fleet.	Archived Knowledge	It seems like this Brother Alen we keep hearing about might have some answers. At least, I sure hope so. Everyone here seems a bit... evasive. I think I saw some archivists heading into the southern cloister. If we follow them, I bet we'll find Alen too. 
Meet Taelia in Brennadam.	Carry On	Let's get to Brennadam right away. We need to find Brother Pike and get to the bottom of all of this before things get any worse. This road should take us right into town. Brennadam's the busiest market this side of Boralus, so there should be plenty of people there who can help us find Pike. Ready when you are! 
Meet with Lucille Waycrest at Arom's Stand in Drustvar.	Take the High Road	Let us continue to Arom's Stand. It will take some time to parse the knowledge of the tome and train more inquisitors for our cause. If the order's weapons are as effective against the coven as they were against the Drust, we may stand a chance of rescuing my family and restoring this land to its former glory. I will make my way there on foot. Until we meet again, Mechanic. 
Empower Korvash's Skull in the depths of Waycrest Manor.	Waycrest Manor: Draining the Heartsbane	The skull you have taken from Korvash needs to be steeped in Gorak Tul's magic to grant the power needed to bridge the gap to Thros. You must take it to a font of his power, and let it absorb his magic. You will find one such font in Waycrest Manor - the epicenter of the coven's power. Here, their leader has tapped so freely into Tul's power that it emanates from the very walls. Bring Korvash's skull to the heart of the manor and let it feast. Then, the effigy will be complete. 
Speak with Lor'themar in Silvermoon City.	The Pride of the Sin'dorei	Champion, I am here on behalf of Lor'themar Theron and the city of Silvermoon. The Regent Lord asks for your assistance with a ceremony of great importance to our people. He requests your presence at your earliest convenience.

Slay Tidemistress Ethendriss.	Dark Tides	A tidemistress leads some nefarious ritual above a pool. Do not look in the pool when we approach it, or you will be rewarded with a view of our drowned allies. We must put a stop to this ritual. The tidemistress is key. 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	A Mission of Unity	You have undertaken great journeys during your time here in Zandalar. It is time for your next mission. Report to the Banshee's Wail. 
Toss the Emerald Shards into the lake and collect the Dreamglow Dragonscale.	The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of	All that remains is to throw the emerald fragments you collected into the lake. I will use my power to bind them together. If this works, they will be reforged into a powerful dragonscale that you can use to empower the Heart of Azeroth. I believe that my mother would be pleased that some of our power will go toward saving the world. I hope she would be proud of us.

Hurry back tae Silithus as quick as ye can. Azeroth needs ye! 
Slay Grand Ma'da Ateena.	Ateena's Fall	You have proven to be a much greater ally dan I could have ever hoped. Thanks to you and your Horde, we have come dis far. Now, there is only one thing dat remains. We must confront de leader of de blood trolls and put an end to their dark plot once and for all. Without Ateena's mojo to protect it, we can finally destroy dat monstrosity of theirs before it can be unleashed upon Zuldazar. You know what must be done. First, I must prepare myself. Go. I will join you when de battle has begun. 
	Alpaca It Up

Escort Lucille Waycrest into Gol Var.	The Ruins of Gol Var	What lies beyond are more ruins, much like those the coven sought. However, these ruins served a different purpose, one that established the legacy of House Waycrest thousands of years ago. Let us head inside, and I will explain. 
Hold council with Talanji and Rokhan to decide your next steps.	The Aid of the Loa	De blood trolls are stronger than ever, thanks to dis G'huun... and now dey are empowering a giant construct!

Use the power of Krag'wa to defeat the blood troll counterattack.	Krag'wa the Terrible	Your previous attack has angered the blood trolls. They now send an army to take everything. They are too late! I am Krag'wa! I will not be eaten, I do the eating! Meet me at the edge of Razorjaw River. You will bear witness to my power, and I will bear witness to yours. 
Send the targets chosen by Valtrois back for examination.	Face Your Enemy	We have decided that our best course of action would be to enter the prison disguised as Proudmoore military. Rexxar will be our prisoner. We want to keep a low profile until we break Ashvane out. I find that I work better with reference when undertaking this type of endeavor. I have chosen some humans that interest me. I would like to examine their faces. Use the Shard of Vesara on them, and they will be... encouraged to find their way to me. 
Recover Corrupted Disc Fragment	Discs of Norgannon	King Mechagon unit in possession of Norgannon disk. Data is corrupted, possession of such data is dangerous. Please aid in the recovery of Corrupted Disk Fragments that have been discarded via Mechagon waste systems. Deliver recovered Corrupted Disc Fragment to Data Analyzer R33-DR for purging. 
Leona Mistcaller, Dunkin Crackjaw, and Adalin Halfheight rescued.	Time for Heroics	That card you found was a gold rare Huolon!

We need to find Leona Mistcaller, Dunkin Crackjaw, and Adalin Halfheight immediately! 
Destroy 8 Offerings to G'huun in Zul'Nazman.	Offerings to G'huun	Been watchin' these cultists with both good eyes. Those big glowin' jars o' theirs look important.

Drive back the Mantid Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Assault: The Endless Swarm	The mantid swarm is surging! There's no way the Golden Lotus will be able to handle this many of them. We must do something to drive them back! 
Meet with Calia Menethil and Derek Proudmoore.	Sail With the Tide	Hello, $p. I have received word from Calia asking that we meet with her once again. She has so much to offer those who feel lost, those seeking a better way. Once she is free of doubt, she will know what must be done. Will you join me? 
Mount Cooper to begin your show and score at least 300 points.	Best In Show	Now that the troggs have been taken care of, let's get on with the real show! You've more than proven yourself as a capable rider - ready to get back in the ring and go big? See if you can beat three hundred points! 
Find Julwaba within Zul'Ahjin.	Searching the Ruins	Dese dunes are crawling with assassins. Nowhere is safe, but we must press on. De ruins aren't far from here. Let's continue our search on foot. 
Search the Deal Farmstead for any survivors.	Deal's Off	There's one more farm left, far to the west. They're real close to the kraul. Deal works the land by herself. If anyone got hit bad, it'd be her. It's just past the worst part of the collapse, so keep an eye out for the quilboar. 
Rescue Farseer Ori.	Rescue The Farseer	My master, Farseer Ori, has been imprisoned by the forces of Queen Azshara. Farseer Ori was captured while performing a sacred ritual to call upon the elements for guidance. I managed to escape, but the ritual has been left unfinished. If we do not rescue my master soon, the elements will grow even more restless. The elemental balance must be maintained. I fear what may become of my clan and our bond with the elements if Farseer Ori is not returned to us. 
Speak with Princess Talanji.	Vol'dun	General Jakra'zet detests the Horde and cannot be trusted. As long as he remains in power, the city will never be safe. We are not alone in our suspicions. Speak to Princess Talanji to follow up. 
Speak with MOTHER to activate the Titanic Research Archive, then examine the archives.	Accessing the Archives	The information you've gathered has allowed us to better understand these manifestations. I believe MOTHER is waiting to share some of her findings with you. 
Move deeper into Nazjatar with Jaina and Genn.	Up Against It	We must move quickly if we are to find safety for our people. This cave is barely defensible, and much of our army is in an even more precarious position. Let's search deeper. 
Meet Jaina and Genn in the cave within Spears of Azshara.	In Deep	By now, King Greymane and Lady Proudmoore should be in the cave at which we are to meet. Let's not keep them waiting.

Investigate the Temple of Akunda.	Akunda Awaits	I've spoken to every troll out here, asking if they've seen Rakera. As you might have guessed, Akunda is de only name dey know. Let's hope someone within de temple will be able to tell us something useful. 
Kill 15 Nazmani trolls in Koramar.	Nazmani Cultists	The rumors o' the blood trolls from back in Boralus don't line up with the letters from Captain Conrad. Open to trade? Willin' to work with us against the Horde? Ready to teach us their magic? Hogwash. Only time worth spendin' with these evil trolls is time killin' 'em. 
Activate the Titan Consoles in the Chamber of Heart to check the status of the titan forges throughout Azeroth.	Network Diagnostics	Unfortunately, we've got no clue where N'Zoth has been lurking since his escape. We do, however have an idea where he might strike. Back when the keepers were imprisoning the Old Gods, they built defense mechanisms against their corruption into the titan forges. If N'Zoth wants tae corrupt Azeroth, he'll have tae go through them first. Fortunately, we've got ourselves hooked up tae them now, so we can monitor them from here. Go ahead an' take a look. 
Tour Rustbolt with Prince Erazmin.	Welcome to the Resistance	Life in the Rustbolt Resistance is not easy, George. But it is yours. We will not order you around or force you to fight. Mechagon is a land of endless opportunities, and you may chase whichever opportunities you see fit. Of course, if you'd like suggestions for which improvements you most require, myself or any of the other mechagnomes in town will be happy to advise you of your current weaknesses. But, for now, I ask simply that you walk with me to my workshop.

The only problem was findin' out where tae shoot it. That is, until now. Take these anchors and head through that portal. Ye'll need tae find some prominent landmarks tae place 'em so we can focus the weapon. Once they're set, we'll be ready tae fire. Ye'll only get one shot. Make it count! 
Survive the Trial of Jani.	Curse of Jani	Thief and killer, know dat ya be standin' before da Patron of Scavengers, da Lord of Thieves, da God of Garbage, Master of Minions, and da Keeper of Secrets.

Quite a few pages are missing, but I bet you can recover them out on the dunes! 
Ride with the Princess Talanji.	Welcome to Zuldazar	Champion of de Horde, welcome to de city of Zuldazar, capital of de Zandalari Empire, de jewel of all troll civilizations. I would have you ride by my side so we might discuss matters without prying ears close at hand. 
Collect the keys from Irontide Lieutenants.	The Keys to Success in Freehold	I've been known to be a betting man, and I'd place good odds on the information we need being in Harlan Sweete's Strongbox. This would be far too valuable to put anywhere else. I bet they haven't even moved the chest. The problem is the security features. See, the chest is locked by three keys and he gave each one to a different lieutenant. We'll need to get those. But between your skills, my finesse and Taelia's air support this will be easy. 
Slay Jabra'kan the Poacher.	WANTED: Jabra'kan	To any hunters worthy of the challenge:Find and defeat the troll known as Jabra'kan. His poaching ways have robbed Warbeast Kraal of valuable eggs, hides, and beasts for their pens. Seek out Wingrider Nivek for your reward. 
Acquire intelligence from the Alliance.	The Things They Carried	We need to know more about these sailors before we report back. Ideally, we would invade their camp but there are too many for our small group to take on. Lucky for us, they are focused on their salvage operation over safety. See if you can find any intelligence on their leaders who are scavenging the derelicts. 
Use the Ramparts Cannon to break the barrier at the gate to Upper Corlain.	Break On Through	Cannon's ready, boss. Care to do the honors? 
10 Ancient Runestones collected.	A Growing Mystery	This runestone could be of Vrykul origins. Is it possible that Vrykul once visited this island? Where there's one runestone, there's usually more. The roots of lashers are drawn to the magic of runestones. If there are more buried here, the Lasher roots maybe wrapped around them! Clear these lashers and see if any have runestones tangled in their roots. 
Meet Magni Bronzebeard at the Halls of Origination in Uldum.	A Titanic Problem	We've no time tae waste. Without the Forge of Origination, Azeroth is left vulnerable tae N'Zoth's corruption. Not tae mention it holds a weapon capable of wipin' out all life on Azeroth! We'll need tae head over tae the forge right away. MOTHER can hold down the fort here. Hurry on, I'll meet ye there. 
Recover a copy of ""Fear and Flesh"" from the depths of a Horrific Vision for Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.	Stepping Through the Darkness	By now you've noticed the protection of your cloak wavering the deeper you delve into these visions. To further bolster your resistance to N'Zoth's influence, we will need to gain an even deeper understanding of his nefarious power. Seek out knowledge from manifestations deeper within the visions, and we shall have our answers soon enough. 
Ride Old Rotana into battle against the blood trolls.	Bulwark of Torcali	We got Old Rotana up on her feet again. Load up an' take her reins. Give us some cover so Talanji can fight her way in from her side. 
Rescue 8 souls from the vision.	A Hand in the Dark	Imagine being trapped in a world you didn't know existed--a reality unbeknownst to even yourself. Thoughts, fears, and dark desires cloud the mind, coupled with irresistible temptation. So many are lost to the darkness, unable to resist these temptations, but not all. Do what you can to preserve those that fight against the darkness. We mustn't allow them to fall. 
Seek out Wrathion outside the entrance to Blackwing Descent.	Black Winged Shadow	Obviously, the Black Prince isn't here. Trust me when I say he's not an easy one to find. If I were you, I'd make my way to Blackrock Mountain. There's a terrace carved into its slopes, where Nefarian once made his lair. Wrathion has been monitoring that place for a long time. Even if he's not there himself, you might find someone who knows where to look. And Mechanic... it's clear you're not the only one searching for him. Watch your back. 
Kill Grozztok within Atul'Aman.	Grozztok the Blackheart	A group of us were dropped off here and left to die. Our first night at camp, I was jolted from sleep by de gurgling cries of my fellow exiles. Jakra'zet sent assassins to our camp, looking for Rakera. Their leader, Grozztok, came for me, but Rakera intervened. She chased him into de dunes, but dat was days ago. If you cross paths with Grozztok, don't hesitate to drive a blade into his black heart. 
Use the Petrified Ebony Scale atop the Heart Forge to infuse its power into the Heart of Azeroth.	Harnessing the Power	Heart Forge online. Initiate final attunement sequence. Awaiting input from champion unit George. 
Use the Horn of the Mountain to rally 8 Kul Tirans.	Mountain Sounds	Kul Tirans won't go down without a fight! Take this horn. We use it in the mountains to warn each other of danger and lead the charge into battle. Use it to rally our allies against the troggs! 
Defend the villagers as they board the boat in the Timbered Strand.	Hope They Can't Swim	We've got a small boat docked right across the way there. If we can get these villagers safely on board, they should be able to make it to Fallhaven by river. You're a capable fighter, no doubt. Can I count on you to fend off any attackers while we get them to safety? 
Speak with Speaker Utia in Mezzamere for your reward.	Supplies From the Waveblade Ankoan	The Waveblade Ankoan appreciate all the aid you've provided. Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us. 
Obtain a Conqueror's Trophy from the commander of an Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Proof of Tenacity	If the Highkeeper is so convinced that we don't stand a chance against our enemies, perhaps a show of force would sway him. I am not sure how you would manage, but if you could bring proof of a victory against those who threaten the Vale, it may convince him that action should be taken. 
Gather 100 War Resources. War Resources can be obtained from many sources, including quests and treasure chests.	The War Cache	First things first. Remember... this is a war. We accomplish nothing by simply adding the Zandalari to our ranks. We eventually need to crush the Alliance. You and I will be leading operations in Kul Tiras. But first, we need resources. 
Choose a loa.	Picking a Side	Look, dis has gone on long enough, $p. I am not one to hold a grudge, but I will be damned if I let you double dip with Raal's loa and my own. Time has come to pick a loa. De loa are not de sharing type. 
Slay Alliance within Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Call to Arms: Vale of Eternal Blossoms	Our objectives in Vale of Eternal Blossoms are being interrupted by the influx of Alliance scum. Clear as many of them out of the area that you find, then report back. 
Find Jaina in Thros, the Blighted Lands.	Thros, the Blighted Lands	The Blighted Lands... If the legends are true then inside we will witness suffering and torment the likes of which we have never known. .....but if that is what I must endure to right what I have wronged, then I will cross that threshold gladly. Will you join me, Mechanic? 
Speak with Atolia Seapearl in Newhome for your reward.	Supplies From The Unshackled	Your aid has given us hope. Your courage has given us strength. You have given us an entirely new vision of our future, George. For that we will be forever grateful. I hope we can continue to repay you for all you have done! 
Feed the Child of Torcali.	Sleep, Eat, Repeat	<The Child of Torcali pushes the sack of herbs around with her snout. She then looks to you and stomps eagerly in place.> 
Collect Bilge Rat Orders, Cutwater Corsair Orders, and Blacktooth Brawler Orders.	The Big Job	So the Irontide Raiders are bringing the various outlaw crews together for a big job using weapons provided by the Ashvane Company. Something tells me they're not going fishing. We should see if members of the smaller crews are carrying any notes or orders. I trust you can handle it? I need to lay low and catch up with Venrik. If anyone else were to recognize me, the odds of them offering a friendly drink are precisely zero. 
Use the Crimsonwood Demolisher to destroy witch forces in the Crimson Forest.	Stick It To 'Em!	We have been able to stop the Grand Rite but the witches will try again unless we act. We have to destroy them. Utterly.<Cleardawn smiles.>How kind of them to give us the means. You've helped us get this far, George. You control the Demolisher. Destroy everything you see! Once we've finished we can signal for help out of here! 
	The Winged Typhoon	NYI - Parrot poop bombing run 
Listen to Princess Talanji.	We Need Each Other	My father believes he is indulging me. He has ruled for two hundred years, many lifetimes of trolls. In his mind, de threats dat face our kingdom are minor. I have seen too much to believe dat. So since my father and his advisors would not help, I turned to someone who would. Your warchief needs our fleet, and I need her champions. So here is what we need to do.

All that's left is settin' the final pieces in place. 
	Quartermaster's Bounty	 
Defeat Yazma and Vol'kaal in the Garden of the Loa.	Mistress of Lies	If you are done dealing with dese peasant loa, den perhaps you can help with my own loa: Shadra. My ""high"" priestess, Yazma, is behind all of dis. If she is having her minions slay other loa, den I can only guess she is also trying to sacrifice my own loa as well. Shadra's shrine is on de northwest side of de Garden of the Loa. You must stop her from slaying de Mistress of Spies. 
Have Herbert Gloomburst transform you into an ogre, then scout the nearby ogre citadel.	Right Beneath Their Eyes	We need to get into Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the last survivor, and stop the ogre necromancer behind all of this.

Speak with Herbert when you're ready.

I don't hold any misconceptions about how that crazy king is going to welcome us. Guns blazin', I'm sure. So we're going in quietly on this submarine. Low profile'll keep us all safe. When you're ready to go, talk to Captain Krooz. 
Meet Kelsey Steelspark in Zuldazar.	Sensitive Intel	I've received a report from Kelsey Steelspark. She claims to have discovered something that will aid our war effort. She's refused to go into specifics, citing a need for secrecy with such sensitive intel. It looks like you'll need to speak to her in person. She's expecting you in Xibala. 
Take the Stormwind portal to Darnassus and meet Maiev Shadowsong at the Zoram Strand in Ashenvale.	Shores of Fate	So be it. You are more trustworthy an ally than any army Wrynn would have sent. We will reclaim Darkshore together, but first we must find Tyrande. Without her at the front, our forces will crumble against the Horde. She left for the Zoram Strand with a small force not long ago. If we move now, we may be able to find her before the Horde does. 
Listen to Commander Wyrmbane's battle plan, then speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth to travel to Talanji's Rebuke in Zuldazar.	Zuldazar Foothold	King Wrynn passed along orders to dispatch our finest to establish a foothold in Zandalar. That means you. Fortunately, we have a few choices as to where we can set up camp. Stick around. I'll go over the battle plan. 
Slay Alliance within Mechagon.	Call to Arms: Mechagon	Our objectives in Mechagon are being interrupted by the influx of Alliance scum. Clear as many of them out of the area that you find, then report back. 
Test the Liquid Fire flasks on 3 Briarwood Bulwarks.	Fighting With Fire	Excellent! Now that we have these lovely Liquid Fire flasks prepared we have one last thing to do:Test them out! There are some of those large abominations lurking about in the woods above my home. I think they would make excellent test subjects for our little alchemical experiment, wouldn't you say? 
Travel on Scarbeak to Dazar'alor.	The Prophet's Ploy	King Rastakhan's life is in grave danger. Zul is far more powerful than he appears. We do not have much time. You have to warn de king before Zul can act. Habutu and Zolani can take you dere. Now go! 
Use the Kul Tiras Campaign Map to choose a foothold.	The Kul Tiras Campaign	Our enemy spreads its influence throughout Kul Tiras, recruiting new allies to fight against the Horde. We must establish footholds in these enemy lands if we are to win this war. The Warchief requires your assistance in securing outposts in Stormsong Valley, Drustvar, and Tiragarde Sound. Which location shall we secure first? 
Learn more about potential allies.	A Choice of Allies	I was chosen to act as an ambassador to our new allies due to my experience with the pandaren joining the Alliance. I've made some notes about some potential allies that may be willing to join the Alliance. Learn more about them, then speak with me. 
Complete 4 world quests on Zandalar or occupied warfront zones.	Alliance War Effort	Assist the Alliance by completing 4 world quests on Zandalar or occupied warfront zones. 
Meet Habutu and Zolani at Warport Rastari.	A Port in Peril	A group of mogu have taken hold of Warport Rastari and now threaten to encroach further into my city. It would seem Zul is losing his grip over his pets. Dat port is vital to our military fleet. If de brutes succeed, Zuldazar will fall, and dere won't be a fleet to aid your precious Horde. You wish to prove yourself an ally of de Zandalari? Meet my blade and shield at de port and clean up dis mess. 
Search Rastakhan's Might for clues.	A Strange Port of Call	I know Rastakhan is furious dat dey claimed his ship, of all de vessels in our navy. But dere is a better question to ask. Why did dey bring it here? Zeb'ahari is a small fishing village. Dere are no warriors here, no powerful supporters of de king. Dere must be another reason. Board de ship and have a good look around. See if you can find out why dey brought dat beast of a boat way out here. 
Meet Merithra at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah.	In Darkness, I Dream	The green dragonflight calls for aid. The Emerald Dream, which they have watched over for eons, has been invaded by terrible creatures of the Void. Merithra of the Dream is attempting to combat the threat, but she cannot do so alone. If you seek to empower the Heart of Azeroth with the strength of the green dragonflight, you must first help Merithra save it. Meet her at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah, and assist her however you can. 
Slay Vilnak'dor and stop the sacrifice of Rezan.	To Sacrifice a Loa	Rezan's power is fading. My usurpers have nearly completed their task. I have read of de horrors of Zul'Drak, and I have seen de results of dese acts. To think one of my own people would bring dis heresy here is... unimaginable.<Rastakhan snarls in anger.>Come! We will end dis traitor who spits in de face of all loa! Di chuka Rezan! 
Kill the Herald of the Queen to release Mak.	Save A Friend	In the cave ahead is where they are holding Mak. They torture us. They break us. Don't let them take her, too. 
Use the A.M.O.D. to destroy the naga camps and defeat Grobathan.	Field Evaluation	We got the A.M.O.D. back together. It's a fine piece of equipment, but we're gonna have to give it a tune up. We don't want to end up digging shrapnel out of our rears. Lucky for us, there are a few naga camps remaining along with the giant that broke the gun in the first place. They'll be great for target practice. We'll deploy the A.M.O.D. just outside the building here. After we deploy, go man it. I'll have you fire a few rounds while I tune its gun. Everything'll be fine... unless it isn't. 
Speak with Lor'themar.	The Eve of Battle	George, we must speak of the Horde... and the warchief. The war has proven costly, and the battle against Azshara drained what little resources we had left. The Horde is divided once more and the Alliance fares little better than we do. Sylvanas is now in a position to destroy everyone she considers an enemy. That means us, as well. I had hoped that my old friend would see reason, but now...High Overlord Saurfang is rallying those of us who remain--including some unlikely allies. 
Listen to the Alliance leadership debate the plan.	Our Next Target	Welcome back, $p. We're ready to set sail on our next mission.... Now we just need to reach an agreement on where we're headed. General Feathermoon and I disagree on which Horde target we should prioritize next. But if you'll give me just a moment, I'm confident I can convince her the value of my strategy and we'll be swiftly on our way. I've considered every reasonable alternative. This is the best course of action. 
Locate someone who can explain the visions.	Wriggling Mass	<The tendril writhes and pulsates in your hand as your mind is assailed by all manner of vicious thoughts. One vision in particular surfaces in your mind again and again. In your mind's eye, you picture a many-eyed goat laying in a pool of black water. As you approach, its eyes burst open, and in an instant you find yourself looking upward at the goat from deep within the puddle. As you sink into the icy darkness, everything goes black. You pocket the mass and shake the thoughts from your head. 
Meet Rexxar within Warfang Hold in Stormsong.	Tracking Tidesages	Rexxar has been tracking a powerful tidesage to help us find the body of Marshal Valentine. He has sent word of a breakthrough. Travel to Stormsong. Help the half-ogre and Lilian find this tidesage, and bend him to the will of the Horde. Do not come back without a way to find Marshal Valentine. 
Repel the Alliance forces assaulting Zuldazar.	Shores of Zuldazar	Alliance forces are attacking Zuldazar. Make them regret every step taken on our soil! 
Meet King Rastakhan within the Great Seal.	War Is Here	We need to move, George. We've received word that the Alliance have mounted an attack through Nazmir. Make for the Great Seal. King Rastakhan and Princess Talanji are there forming a plan of attack. Make no mistake, we will crush the Alliance. They are fools to attack us through Nazmir. 
Speak with Druza Netherfang to teleport to Ar'gorok, then report to Wistel Silversnitch.	To the Front	We're at war in the Arathi Highlands. The battle has died down for now, but when it flares up again, we'll need you on the front. Druza Netherfang maintains a portal directly to Ar'gorok. She can help you. 
Drive back the Mogu Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Assault: The Warring Clans	The opportunistic mogu clans seek to take the Vale while its defenders are recovering from N'Zoth's attack. They are both cowardly and foolish. Show them the error of their ways. 
Meet Magni at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal.	A Fresh Trauma	Azeroth is strugglin' tae survive, but new wounds are formin' at a rapid pace. I can sense her cries o' pain risin' from the north... in a place o' ancient power...<Magni closes his eyes, as if listening to an unseen voice.>By the Forge! Somethin's gone wrong in Mount Hyjal. The World Tree, Nordrassil, is in danger! Meet me there, $p. There's no time tae lose! 
Search the Ashvane Offices for information on where Jaina was taken.	Lost Shipment	I let grief cloud my judgment and Jaina may have already paid the ultimate price for my mistake. Yet, I hold out hope she lives. I do not know where Jaina was taken after Ashvane's people took her from the Keep. The records in their offices here in Boralus will surely tell you where they took her. George, you helped my people when I thought I did not need it. I ask for your help again now. Save my daughter's life! 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	Operation: Grave Digger	Sylvanas has issued us a mission in Drustvar, where we will find our next target. Report to the Banshee's Wail immediately. 
Confront Lord Stormsong.	Storm's End	I've no doubt he can feel our presence, but so long as Lord Stormsong maintains his spell the first move is ours. We have him surrounded, cornered like the rat he is. We must end this together. 
Investigate the ice cavern.	Drustfall	I believe I see more carvings at the entrance to that cave over there. Come, we should see what else was left behind. 
Speak with Dread-Admiral Tattersail to travel to Darkshore and report to Nathanos.	Trouble in Darkshore	We have received some disturbing reports from Darkshore. What was once a secure stronghold for the Horde is now beset by an unnatural darkness. The moon has turned completely black. The outposts there have yet to be reinforced with our main force and we are suddenly outnumbered. Nathanos wants you to meet him in Darkshore and find out what happened. 
Confront Wavespeaker Reid.	Storm's Judgment	When I opened my mind to the currents during the ritual, I felt the presence of a member of Lord Stormsong's innermost circle. Wavespeaker Reid. If anyone can locate the missing fleet, it is him. I will not stand by while my brothers move against our own people. Oaths be damned. We must force Reid to see reason. 
Kill 10 Zanchuli traitors.	Zanchuli Traitors	Dey are trying to cast down our loa, claiming dem to be false gods. Dey have turned to de old ways of blood, sacrifice, and subjugation. I cannot even begin to say how offensive dis is. Kill any of dese traitors you find. 
Meet with Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus Harbor.	Operation: Blood Arrow	We have uncovered the location of a high priority target in Nazmir. Return to the Wind's Redemption for your briefing. 
Slay 6 Bloodbelly Fliers.	Ticks	Kill those bloodbellies before dey take off with all of my soldiers! I will have my troops prepare for a flanking charge. 
Question Enforcers within Dazar'alor.	Discreet Discussions	General Jakra'zet cannot be trusted. He is up to something, but I do not know what. Any who question his actions earn demselves a trip to de sands. As long as he remains in power, my city will never be safe. Speak to his guards. See what you can find out, but be discreet. We do not want to alert Jakra'zet to our actions. 
Follow Lucille Waycrest toward Waycrest Manor in Upper Corlain.	Storming the Manor	Now is our chance. Waycrest Manor is just up that hill, and hopefully inside we'll find my mother and father. If we also manage to find the ""Mother"" that's leading this horrible coven, then we will make her regret the day she ever set foot in Drustvar. Are you with me, Mechanic? 
Send Arcanist Valtrois on a mission.	War of Shadows	I have begun to assemble heroes for our cause. Perhaps you already know Arcanist Valtrois? We will need to recruit more in the future, but this is a promising beginning. Our missions will be those of subterfuge, reconnaissance, assassination, and other focused strikes against our enemies. Let us test the mettle of this nightborne, shall we? 
Destroy the Abyssal Melody.	Storm's Vengeance	I know not what horrors await us ahead, but the Abyssal Melody must never follow its sister into the Shrine of the Storm. We will deny these monsters all that they have wrought here by burning it with the very magic they seek to corrupt. The ritual is ready, but requires a conduit to stabilize. If you are willing, I would have you guide my magic. 
Speak with Mathias Shaw in the garden within Proudmoore Keep.	The Fall of Zuldazar	It's time, George. We have the Abyssal Scepter, along with confirmation that the bombs placed amongst the Zandalari fleet are still active. Unfortunately, even with everything at our disposal, we would still lose a frontal assault against the Zandalari empire. For that reason, we plan to lure the forces of the Horde and the Zandalari away from the harbor. Mathias Shaw is holding a meeting nearby, and he has requested your presence. 
Charter a ferry to Stormsong Monastery.	The Missing Fleet	The tidesage order has a sizable monastery right here in Boralus. I say we start our search for the fleet there. Someone there has to know something, right? You don't just lose the entire legendary Kul Tiran fleet on accident! We'll need to take a ferry over to the monastery. Make sure you bring your pass with you! 
Meet Magni Bronzebeard outside Mogu'shan Vaults in Kun-Lai Summit.	It's Never Easy	The last I heard, Mogu'shan Vaults was still abandoned. We shouldn't have too tough of a time reachin' the engine, since we've already defeated the mogu guardians in that place. Well, what are ye waitin' for? Let's get that engine turned on! 
Report to Captain Rez'okun at the Port of Zandalar.	Island Expedition	Our spies have intercepted an Alliance message describing an outcropping of Azerite out in the Great Sea. The Banshee's Wail isn't quick enough to get us there before they do. Lucky for us, I've arranged to have a Zandalari ship rigged and ready to go for opportunities like this. Go speak with Captain Rez'okun on the western side of the docks. He's been briefed, and should be waiting for you. 
	Not Too Sober Citizens Brigade	 
Enter a Horrific Vision to discover what dark manifestations await in a world ruled by N'Zoth.	Into the Darkest Depths	With our connection secured, it is time for us to breach the veil and discover what lies beyond. What you find may provide us the key to unlocking our success. 
Investigate the Mildenhall Meadery.	Mayhem at Mildenhall Meadery	Ahhhh! <Sir/Miss>, please, I need some help! My dad hasn't come back from the meadery and, and... well, when I went to look, there were giant globs of honey everywhere. But... but, somehow, they were moving on their own. I even saw one eat a bunny, I swear! I'm scared to go back by myself, but I think dad is in trouble. Can you go with me? 
Help Oculeth open a portal to Zuldazar.	A Way Home	We can harness the power within this place to open a portal home. I will require your assistance. Isn't this fun? You get to be my assistant! Ah, yes. Just come with me and all you have to do is wave that Heart of Azeroth of yours around. I'll handle the rest. 
Acquire Shellsteel Plating, Multi-Leg Chaindrive, and a Mechanobot Ignition.	Shop Project	As a reward for all your help here, I was planning to fix this old mechaspider mount to give to you. I could use some more of your help though to get this project started! I'll need parts off a few of the bots nearby, and maybe you could talk to Cork Stuttgard at Bondo's Yard and see if you can get a Mechanobot Ignition system. 
Speak with Flynn Fairwind in Bridgeport.	Under Their Noses	Figures they wouldn't just put the destination on the crates for us. Nothing's ever easy, is it? If the weapons aren't moving on Cagney's ferry, they must be passing through Bridgeport, the shipping hub just up the road. Bridgeport is protected by a garrison of Proudmoore marines. The Ashvane Company has a lot of nerve moving illegal weapons right under their noses. Come on, let's check it out. 
Take the Tome of Silver and Ash in Gol Var.	The Order of Embers	The Order of Embers was the name given to those who took up these arms against the Drust. Using the tools and methods uncovered by the scholars, they were able to counter the Drust's magic, and ensure our victory in the war. If the coven wants to use the Drust's magic against us, then we'll use the order's weapons against them. The knowledge of the order rests here, but without a hand to wield it, it will do us no good. Will you be that hand, Mechanic? Will you revive the Order of Embers? 
Slay 6 Bound Seasurges.	Freedom for the Sea	The naga along this coast appear to be trying to push the shoreline up the hill here. We've been able to keep them back at the beach so far, but they've been binding more elementals than we can keep up with. Without a tidesage, we have no way to free the elementals from their bindings, but we cannot allow them to push forward anymore. The spirit of the sea should not be contained by anything. Slay them, and let them return to the ocean. 
Slay 6 Ashvane combatants in Unity Square.	Enemies Within	We need to get Katherine to safety. Help us take out some of these traitors! 
Meet King Rastakhan at the Zocalo.	Hunting Zul	Zul is pulling all of his forces back to his stronghold at the Temple of the Prophet. Rastakhan has sent word that he is marshalling an army in the Zocalo with anyone still loyal that can carry a weapon. Looks like the old king had more loyalists than Zul expected. That, and he has three of their eldest loa gathered to his side. Go and lend your strength to their army. 
Collect 5 Soft Stoat Pelts from Faintstep Stoats.	The Stoat Hunt	One of the greatest hunting sports amongst the nobles of Boralus is the stoat hunt. It is a sport of determination, patience, and skill. Do you think you can rise to the challenge? Stoats are agile, sneaky, and sharp. They're next to impossible to catch out in the forest, so the best way to find one is to find its burrow and scare it out. Find their burrows and bring back their pelts. Their fur is soft and much loved amongst the nobles. 
Meet Vorrik at Bwoljin's Fall.	The Missing Key	Korthek has grown spiteful and arrogant over the years, but I realize now that he has grown mad as well. Mythrax will kill all of us if he is released. For too long, I've held out hope that I could convince Korthek peacefully to abandon his heresy. I was wrong. All of Zandalar is at risk while Korthek and his allies hold even one key to Mythrax's prison. Meet me outside his fortress in the north. We will confront my old friend ""Emperor"" Korthek and end this together. 
Deliver Evelyn Pare's letter to Constable Henry Framer at Hangman's Point.	An Airtight Alibi	It'll take us a while to clean up the beasts that are left over, but I'm confident we'll be able to take back Fletcher's Hollow--thanks to you, of course. Here, take this letter to the constable. It should be enough to clear Miss Waycrest's name. I'm sorry you had to witness all of this, mainlander. We are good people, but these are terrible times. 
Speak to Barry in the Honeyback Hatchery.	Leaving the Hive	<The enormous bee twitches its antennae toward you. It swings its abdomen toward the cave exit.>Barry might know what's going on. 
Use the Zandalar Campaign Map to choose a foothold.	The Zandalar Campaign	It is time that we begin to think of our enemy, George. The Horde spreads its influence throughout Zandalar unchecked. King Anduin has charged us with establishing footholds in the areas of Zuldazar, Nazmir, and Vol'dun. I have taken the liberty of deploying some of our forces in key locations, but each will need a firm hand--your hand--to direct our efforts. Which location shall we secure first? 
Meet Gallywix at Bilgewater Bonanza.	A Mech for a Goblin	Gallywix has a plan to deal with the Alliance and has requested your help. It involves the Azerite you reclaimed. Speak with him down at Bilgewater Bonanza, and do whatever you can to help him... when it comes to the interest of the Horde. Oh, and make sure Gallywix stays alive. The Alliance already tried to kill him. 
Scour the forest of Darkshore to find the Warchief.	Killer Queen	Lor'danel is now secure, but something is amiss... there has been no sign of Stormrage. Malfurion would have never let Lor'danel fall without a fight. He must have gone after her. My army has approached from the North, and our reinforcements have arrived from the South -- which means that they are not along any of the roads. Search the forest with me, George. We will find them and be done with this once and for all. 
Seek out Wrathion at the Tavern in the Mists.	Spies to the Left and Right	Ebonhorn cannot resist the whispers for long. The dark forces that once corrupted the black dragonflight seek to overwhelm the world once again. We need a way to fight back. While I am loathe to mention him, I do know of someone who has been studying the Old Gods in order to better combat their insidious power: Wrathion. The Black Prince has associates in Pandaria, in the Tavern of the Mists at the Veiled Stair. I suggest you begin your search there. Please hurry, $p. 
Find and slay Mista Nice.	Mista Nice	I am normally not a violent tortollan, but if there is one thing I cannot abide, it is a scoundrel using children for his own profit. The street scamps appear to be working at the behest of a ring leader. I do believe they call him ""Mista Nice"" though I suspect the name to be sarcastic in nature. I have a scroll here that can let you move among the scamps and see if they lead you back to Mista Nice. If they do, slay him and I shall pay you a bounty. 
Travel to Nazmir and meet Magni outside Uldir.	A Brother's Help	We're gonna need all the help we can get te save the planet. I've got an idea. Meet me in Nazmir, outside the Heart of Darkness. Together, we'll seek guidance from someone who may be able to help. 
Use Lashk's Scroll of Eternal Return to put Torga's spirit to rest.	Torga's Eternal Return	Well, we did it. Doesn't make the plan we had any less crazy. But there's still one more thing left to do. I've been visiting Torga for years. He told me stories of powerful scrolls, one in particular that he said was meant to be used to put a loa's spirit to rest. I think you should be the one to read it. I mean, if you're SMART enough to read it. Bah! Just take the scroll and read it before I have second thoughts. 
Speak with Lord Arthur Waycrest in Whitegrove Chapel.	Running Late	I beg your pardon, but I am a little concerned at Lord Waycrest's tardiness. I'd hate to be a bother, but would you mind checking on him? The ceremony awaits his presence. You can find him in the bride's room, at the top of the tower. 
Speak to Torcali.	Wander Not Alone	She is here. I can feel her eyes upon us. My loa is generous. She will reward you for de service you have given her. Great Wanderer guide your path, George. 
Speak your name to Akunda the Exalted.	Trial of Truth	Those within our temple have left their past lives behind. They devote themselves entirely to Akunda. Dis final test is perhaps de most important. Dis is de moment of truth. You will speak your name, as you will be known from dis day forth. 
Complete the ritual.	Opening the Way	Hmm. This ritual is a bit... tricky. No matter, together we will be able to complete it. I shall begin to channel. You will need to activate the runes in the proper order. I shall leave the scroll here so you may consult it. 
Speak to Jol the Ancient and Jamil Abul'housin.	In Bwonsamdi's Shadow	Something is wrong, George. My king is blessed by de loa in ways your kind cannot imagine. He has been given long life, swift healing, and strength beyond most trolls. But still, he lingers on death's door. I can practically hear Bwonsamdi laughing. Two of his most trusted menders are with him. Go and find out what is taking so long. I will make sure dey are not interrupted. 
Defeat Rare enemies on the island of Mechagon.	Security First	Many dangerous creatures and allies of my father still seek to destroy us. Help secure this island, seek out and and eliminate five of our most powerful enemies. 
Meet Rexxar in Tiragarde Sound.	Azerite Denied	The Kul Tirans and Alliance are amassing a vast amount of their Azerite and Azerite weapons within Tiragarde Sound. They have a new supply of the resource, thanks to the Kul Tirans' conquest over Lady Ashvane and her company. We must strike at their supplies of Azerite and destroy these weapons, or else we will be behind in this war. You and Zelling will travel to Tiragarde Sound and meet with Rexxar. Lead the assault on their Azerite supply. And do not return until you are victorious. 
Speak with Cagney at Eastpoint Station. Take the ferry from Will Melborne in Tradewinds Market.	The Ashvane Trading Company	So, Ashvane's goons are walking around with a new powder that can blow a galleon clean in half and the military has no idea. We need to find out how much of this powder they have and where it's going. An old buddy of mine works the ferry down by the Ashvane Foundry. He may know something about this. You can take the ferry from Tradewinds Market to Eastpoint Station. Once you get there, look for a man named Cagney. Tell him I sent you. He owes me a favor. 
Speak with Inquisitor Notley at Watchman's Rise to scout the areas surrounding Corlain.	A Weather Eye	It would be wise to get a lay of the land before we put together a plan of action. Inquisitor Notley is an expert falconer, and a reliable scout. He utilizes an ancient relic to see through the eyes of his falcon, allowing him to survey great distances. Unfortunately, Notley was injured during the fighting. Nothing serious, but it's left him unable to concentrate enough to control his falcon. Perhaps you could help? 
Scan 10 Clockwork Giants.	The Other Place	In my travels of the many possible futures, I discovered another place much like Rustbolt, but different. In this other time and place, very little is alive, everything is machines. You must travel to this other place. You will scan the memory banks of the Clockwork Giants you find there. Then we will use that data to ensure that our Rustbolt never becomes the other place. 
Meet Gazlowe outside the Great Seal in Dazar'alor.	Rumors of Mechagon	I knew I should've taken that gig with the Greasemonkeys...Gazlowe's crew always get paid, and no dumb risks. I heard they got somethin' big comin' up too... 
Deliver Zolani's report to Habutu at the Golden Throne.	Royal Report	Blood magics practiced in de city, guards missing, and our chief spy, Yazma, is acting suspicious. We must present dis to Rastakhan, but without Yazma interfering. Luckily, Rastakhan is a clever king, which is something his opponents often forget. I have prepared a report in a code made by King Rastakhan and known only to myself and my brother, Habutu. Bring it to Habutu and he will see dat it gets to de king's ear. 
Bring the Void Focus to Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.	Something in Your Mind	<Looking into the crystal, the light around you is slowly drowned in inky smoke. An imposing presence crushes down on you, whispering unintelligibly in your ear. Looking for the source, you see nothing, but the sensation grows. Your head begins to swim as the darkness deepens and the noise becomes deafening. Summoning all your willpower to steel your resolve...The light has returned, the noise silenced, and you stand with a humble crystal in your hand. Perhaps Wrathion knows more about it...> 
Meet Valtrois in Tiragarde Sound.	Breaking Out Ashvane	The Dark Lady wishes to gain another potential ally in the fight against the Alliance. Lady Ashvane, head of the Ashvane Company, was one of the greatest enemies of Kul Tiras until her capture. We are going to release her. Meet Valtrois in Tiragarde Sound. She and Rexxar are working out a plan to break Ashvane out. 
Rescue 6 Tortollan Captives from the blood trolls.	Tortollans in Distress	Our first task is to rescue the tortollans captured by the blood trolls. Keeshan's report indicates the tortollans are familiar with all things Nazmir. They should know about the Horde's operations here. The tortollans tend to stay neutral in most matters. They'll give us details on the Horde's plans if we make a fair trade. We'll meet afterwards at our other outpost, Redfield's Watch, north of Torga's Rest. 
Choose your next move in Zandalar.	Your Next Move	We have some thoughts on the best way to win over the Zandalari. The princess is heading to Nazmir to take the fight to the blood trolls. Her voice carries much weight with the council and her father. General Jakra'zet detests the Horde. Removing his voice from the Zanchuli Council will greatly improve our chances here. We should also keep working on winning over the King here in Zuldazar. This city is vast and has many secrets. 
Obtain 7 Lengths of Chain and 7 bolts of Sail Canvas from the outskirts of Bridgeport.	Making Ourselves at Home	Log cabins will do in a pinch, but... if we're going to be spending any time here, we might as well make ourselves comfortable. The roughnecks left us no shortage of lumber and food supplies, but we'll need canvas and chains to set up some proper Forsaken tents and banners. Bridgeport sounds rather lootable, doesn't it? 
Use the Dowsing Stone to find and Collect 6 Drust Runestones in Gol Osigr.	Buried Power	Since time immemorial, the Drust have used runes to shape their magics. This remains true of the spells woven by Gorak Tul and his ilk. You will need some of these runes for your effigy to be effective. It is likely that some still exist at the site of his final battle, buried under years of soot and snow. Take this stone. It is empowered with the magic of the Thornspeakers and will react to Tul's spells. With it, you should be able to locate the runes, no matter how deep the ages have buried them. 
Collect 100 Large Azerite Grenades from the Ashvane Foundry.	An Explosive Entrance	A hat and some smooth talking won't get us in to Freehold this time, so I'm thinking explosives. And I'm thinking we steal them from Ashvane. Fair's fair, right? She takes something from Lady Katherine, we take some Azerite empowered grenades from Ashvane. Okay, so it's not really the same, but you get where I'm going with this. Head over to Ashvane's Foundry. Grab the biggest Azerite Grenades you can get your hands on. While you do that I'm going to get us some air support. 
Find Flynn Fairwind at the Harbormaster's office in Boralus.	A Local Guide	I've spent a lot of time as a guest of the Harbormaster and I've come to understand a few things about Flynn Fairwind. If anyone can quickly help you to sort out any clues in Freehold, it will be him. Flynn's been doing work for Cyrus and can be found in the Harbormaster's office. Show him the contract and recruit him to our cause. Hurry, George. 
Learn Magni's findings.	Magni's Findings	As if gettin' the Forge back up and runnin' wasn't good enough, I think we may have found the key tae takin' out N'Zoth once and for all in the archives of Mogu'shan Vaults! Ye might want tae be sittin' down for this one, champion. 
Find the author of the Mysterious Letter.	Ruin Has Come	There is a terror beneath the waves. It seeks to destroy my family, my house, and my legacy. You must come, claim your destiny and deliver us from the terrors of the deep! Find our estate to the east, among the isles. We lived opulently in the shadow of the great fortress. We believed the priests would deliver us from the darkness below. Now that darkness has bubbled to the surface, whispering madness in our dreams. Hurry. The air turns the darkest I have seen in my cursed existence. 
Meet with Baine Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff.	When Spirits Whisper	Ah, George! I am pleased the Earthmother guided you here. I have a message for you. Chieftain Bloodhoof asks that you join him in Thunder Bluff at once. I will leave it to our leader to explain why you are being summoned. But I will say that Baine has met with the other spiritwalkers and your name was spoken with urgency. I suggest you hurry. 
Meet Magni Bronzebeard outside the Halls of Origination in Uldum.	Re-Origination	If the Ramkahen haven't reached out tae sound any alarms then the anomaly must be contained within the Halls of Origination. We best get back tae investigate, George. 
Visit the Ferry Dock, the Snug Harbor Inn, the Tradewinds Counting House, and the Flight Master in Tradewinds Market.	Get Your Bearings	I think a proper introduction is in order! My name is Taelia, member of the Proudmoore Guard and squire of Sir Cyrus Crestfall.<Taelia salutes firmly.>Cyrus asked me and Flynn to break you out of that Ashvane prison and get you settled in here at the market, but he neglected to mention that you're with the Alliance. I must say, it's an honor. Let's get you up to speed. 
Listen to Shandris Feathermoon's plan.	How to Kill a Dark Ranger	Let's go over the plan. We don't get many chances to kill a captain of Sylvanas's dark rangers. 
Collect 1 Bundle of Recyclable Parts	More Recycling	<Recycling is fun and profitable. The Recyclerizer DX-82 stands ready to receive more scrap metal.> 
Collect Torn Pages of ""The Curse of Stone"" from Horrific Visions for Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.	"Reconstructing ""The Curse of Stone"""	Thus far, the contents of this book are unsettling to say the least. Nevertheless, I have been able to glean valuable information on the nature of N'Zoth's power, and have made alterations to your cloak accordingly. There remains much to learn, however. Continue your search for additional pages as you delve into the visions. 
Speak with MOTHER to activate the Heart Forge.	The Heart Forge	Rise in Heart Forge energy levels indicates presence of black dragon essence. Recommendation: Initiate Heart Forge activation sequence. 
Examine the deactivated titan keeper outside of Gloom Hollow.	Slumber No More	There's something you should look into. You've got the time anyway, those goblins aren't ready yet. There's a statue nearby. Only, it's not a statue to the trained tortollan eye. It's a deactivated titan keeper! Noises have been coming from that thing ever since you helped Krag'wa. It must be trying to reactivate itself. I bet that titan-looking amulet of yours could help restart it. We'd be unstoppable against the blood trolls with a titan keeper's help. Go see if you can restart this titan! 
Free 10 workers.	Break 'Em Out	An Irontide captain ""Calico McGee"" has been trying to scare us off for days now, but it's not working. He's ordered his men to lock everyone up and sell us as slaves! They've brought enough chains for everyone! Break the chains and set our workers free. 
Talk to Kraal Master B'khor and choose to train your direhorn.	How to Train Your Direhorn	I have to get some of whatever you fed your baby! Wow! Now dat it's bigger, it is time to teach it to be a reliable battle companion. Let's see how it does against a tougher challenge, hmm? Talk to Kraal Master B'khor when you are ready to begin. 
Complete 4 world quests on Kul Tiras or occupied warfront zones.	Horde War Effort	Assist the Horde by completing 4 world quests on Kul Tiras or occupied warfront zones. 
Support your allies in Nazjatar by getting one to rank 3.	A Brief Respite	We have much to do, George. However, we are all weary and require rest. Decisions made while fatigued are almost always the wrong ones to make. The Ankoan have offered their home to us, yet they are barely holding on themselves. We should do what we can to support them while we think about our next move. See what you can do to aid their hunting parties, it may be the only way we survive in this place. 
Give the Inquisitors Regalia to the recruits in Arom's Stand.	A New Order	Before we leave, I have one more task to ask of you. While you were busy recruiting our inquisitors and driving the coven away from Arom's Stand, I took the liberty of placing an order with the local tailor. Using some of the sketches within the tome, I had him put together some uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the ancient order. Since you will be leading our inquisitors, I think it's only fitting that you present them with their new regalia. 
Slay 8 Wailing Sirens.	Blood in the Tides	Curse these slimy wenches! Their singin' sets men's hearts afire and their brains adrift. My ship's aground. My cargo's lost. Nothin' for it now but to fight! 
Speak with Stabby Jane at Castaway Point.	The Castaways	I see the sirens have made another catch. You're lucky they haven't stripped your bones yet. If you need to trade supplies or just warm yourself by the fire, there's a camp up the hill behind me. Everyone there washed up in the tides, just like you. Figure we've got folks from at least four or five shipwrecks now. All banded together, just tryin' to survive. Talk to Stabby Jane. Don't worry about her nickname, she's actually real nice. 
Destroy the Cursed Effigy in Fallhaven.	The Final Effigy	<The effigy's protection has been broken. All that remains is to break the effigy itself.> 
Accept Kua'fon as your new traveling companion.	Down, But Not Out	<Kua'fon wiggles happily in his new armor. He starts to pace restlessly back and forth. A taste for adventure has surely awakened in this flightless creature.>Skree! Skree!! 
Administer the tests to prove Lucy Waycrest's innocence in Hangman's Point.	The Burden of Proof	I think we have everything we need to conduct three of the villagers' tests. Let us hope this is enough to convince them. I'm sure Constable Framer is champing at the bit to proceed with his trial, and I would prefer it if you were the one to administer the tests. I may not know you well, but I trust you farther than the constable. Speak with him when you're ready to begin....and do me a favor. Make this quick. 
Meet with Cyrus Crestfall.	The Old Knight	These days Cyrus is the Harbormaster, but he used to be one of Daelin Proudmoore's most trusted knights! I lost my mother when the Scourge hit Lordaeron. My father sent me here to be raised away from the war. I don't know much about him... just that he was a Stormwind knight who gave his life fighting the Lich King. Daelin hand-picked Cyrus to raise me and forced him to take a desk job. It's the only reason he wasn't at Theramore. He's probably checking in that other Alliance ship. Let's go! 
Collect 100 Saber Flanks, 100 Worg Meat, and 100 Clucker Tidbits.	A Little Goodwill	It sounds like the peons are feeling undervalued. They do important work for the Horde, but their diligence is often overlooked. A little goodwill would go a long way. Let's plan a feast in their honor. We'll need quite a bit of meat to sate their enormous appetites, luckily, I have a totem that can help with that. You acquire the ingredients, and I will make a meal guaranteed to boost morale. 
Retrieve the Tol Dagor Master Key from Overseer Korgus.	Tol Dagor: The Ashvane Overseer	Tol Dagor stands as a well fortified thorn in this nation's side. As you are no doubt aware, Ashvane has taken every opportunity she could to throw any opposition into those cells. Among those in the jail are members of the Alliance that arrived alongside you and Jaina. We now have permission and the needed muscle to free them. Meet up with Taelia on the eastern shore of the island, find the overseer, and take his key. With it, we will have access to the weapon vault and cells. 
Acquire the Ring of Tides.	Blessing of Kimbul	The entrance to the temple is sealed by a magical barrier. According to my scrolls, the barrier can only be lowered by one who has gained the Ring of Tides. There is a statue somewhere in the temple grounds with the power to bestow the ring, but the ruins are overrun with jungle spiders. Tulu and I are not strong enough to explore the lower ruins ourselves. If you can gain the Ring of Tides and enter the temple, we may finally be able to face the naga head on! 
Defeat Bramblefist the Maddened.	Terror of the Kraul	By all the gods of the sea, what a monster! I can barely believe what I am seeing, George. This ettin has undergone the same ritual that the brutes do, and it seems even angrier! If he gets out of here, we won't stand a chance. I know I ask the impossible, but I must: kill this monstrosity and save the whole valley from its wrath! Here, take one of the potion samples you brought me. It's probably dangerous, but you might need it to defeat this beast. 
Leave Hangman's Point with Lucille Waycrest.	And Justice For All	Thank you for helping to redeem me in the eyes of my people, Mechanic. I am in your debt, and I will be sure to let my father know. In the mean time, I think we should find out what this Heartsbane Coven is, and what they are doing in our lands. I hope the marshal will be able to enlighten us. First thing's first, though. Care to undo these ropes? They're starting to chafe. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	What's the Buzz?	 
Accompany Jaina Proudmoore to Anglepoint Wharf and assist her there.	To Anglepoint	An attack on Anglepoint Wharf can only mean one thing: the Horde seeks to destroy the seagate there. This is my home. These are my people. I cannot turn my attention to our operations in Zandalar until we've routed the Horde. The military will take a little time to mobilize, but in the meantime you and I can face these monsters. If we can't stop them, we can slow them down. War has come to my shores once more. I will not stand aside. 
Deliver Wrathion's incomplete journal to MOTHER.	Wrathion's Journal	The whispers ceased as soon as I drank the potion. Thank you, $p. Still, it is gravely concerning that N'Zoth's influence could reach me even within the Chamber of Heart. If Wrathion has found a way to resist the power of the Old Gods, then we can use it to reinforce the Chamber's defenses. Perhaps MOTHER can glean more information from Wrathion's journal. 
Speak to Kalecgos in the Chamber of Heart.	Whispers of N'Zoth	Are you curious how I came to be here, in the Chamber of Heart? Of course I arrived of my own volition, but there was quite a search for me, for a time. Kalecgos remembers how it went. Speak to him, if you wish to relive the details of how I thwarted discovery by both Speaker and Old God. 
Use the goblin devices in Krazzlefrazz Outpost to build your foothold in Drustvar.	Krazzlefrazz Outpost	I already did a bunch of the leg-work for settin' up our foothold. All we gotta do is finish deploying all the instant-base technology, and we'll be good to go here in Drustvar. Why don't you go finish the base building. I'm gonna see if I can salvage any wolfercycle parts. 
Return to the Chamber of Heart and treat Ebonhorn with the Potion of Mental Clarity.	Save Ebonhorn	<The potion appears to be powerful and chaotic. It changes color seemingly at random. This must be the concoction Wrathion wrote about in his journal. Just standing near it grants you a sense of peace and clarity. You may not have found the Black Prince himself, but perhaps what he left behind for you can help Ebonhorn.> 
Help Rocket-Chief Fuselage build the perfect weapon.	Toys For Destruction	Ricket sent word that she was here in Mechagon, so I came right away to help with the uh... research. I had the peons scour the island for any technology they could find. With da stuff we got here, we gonna make some amazing weapons to fight King Mechagon. Then afterwards, we get rich selling 'em! Help me wrangle everyone's ideas into one perfect weapon! 
Offer to make contact with House Waycrest.	Drustvar	The stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. We must secure their aid in order to bring Kul Tiras together under the Proudmoore banner. 
Meet with Inquisitor Cleardawn at Gol Osigr.	Through the Old Roads	Lady Waycrest has entrusted me with securing the town of Falconhurst and the services of Master Alchemist Ashton who lives there. However, I have found out no one has heard from Falconhurst in some time. The skies above the forest are impassable, so we must travel the old roads through Drust ruins in the mountains. A small capable party has a better chance to bypass the growing forces of the witches and to help secure Master Alchemist Ashton. To that end, I ask you to assist me. 
Discuss the plan with Alliance leadership.	Intercepted Orders	Good to see you again, $p. Mathias and I are discussing what to do with new intel that his SI:7 agents procured for us. The intercepted letter contains orders from Warchief Sylvanas for an operation the Horde is undertaking at sea. This could be a rare opportunity, or a distraction. The letter is purposefully light on details, and it's unclear if we should make this a top priority or focus on our other missions. Do you have a moment to talk through this with Mathias and me? 
Report to Katherine Proudmoore in Boralus.	The Mysterious Island	Fate's End is just that. It's where the very worst criminals are sent. No one ever comes back. I'm sorry Lady Katherine will have to hear this, but I'm glad it isn't my job to tell her.<Flynn hands you the document solemnly.>I'm certain she'll want an update, even if the news is as bad as this. 
Defeat 6 Darkglare Watchers within the vision.	A Dark, Glaring Reality	Their eyes are upon us, George, watching every move from the shadows. It is no wonder our efforts thus far have felt... lacking. The fault is by no means your own. We should have suspected this was the case long ago. If we are to continue our efforts with meaningful expectations we must go undetected. Our old friend has offered an elixir to aide in exposing our enemy. While there may be a few... unknown side effects, the result provides the imbiber true sight in the darkness. 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	The Azerite Advantage	We have received intelligence pointing us toward a reliable source of Azerite. We must move quickly to acquire these resources for the Horde. Report to the Banshee's Wail to aid in this urgent mission. 
Meet with Cyril White in Fallhaven in Drustvar.	The Vanishing Lord	Unfortunately, we don't have any contacts within House Waycrest, so our efforts in Drustvar will have to start from the ground up. We have arranged for a ferry to take you to Fallhaven - a farming village in eastern Drustvar. The mayor there, Cyril White, is a longtime friend of the Proudmoores, and I think he can help us get in touch with someone from the house. I hope you can get to the bottom of their absence, George. Their martial might is invaluable to the Kul Tiran fleet. 
Speak with Sylvanas Windrunner.	Most Loyal	The Dark Lady anticipated this as a possible outcome. She has prepared a contingency plan to deal with it accordingly. You are to rendezvous with her in the Ghostlands. Take this hearthstone. It is good for one more use. She will meet you near Windrunner Spire. 
	Siege of Boralus	 
Slay 25 Level 60 Horde anywhere within the Shadowlands.	Against Overwhelming Odds	Your eternal enemy, the Horde, grow in strength and number throughout the Shadowlands. Will you and your comrades simply roll over and yield to their might? No, I expect not. It seems that not even death has quelled your thirst for battle. If you succeed in cutting down your foes, despite the odds, I will reward you handsomely. 
Meet Kiro in Twilight Highlands.	No Problem Too Small	These problems might seem small, but they will eat away at the Horde over time if they remain unaddressed. We must offer our help. The vulpera are skilled at solving problems, no matter their size. I will investigate the outpost. Nisha and Meerah will see to the others. Meet me in the Twilight Highlands when you're ready. 
Report to Trade Prince Gallywix in Zuldazar.	A Trip Across the Ocean	I understand you are to be establishing our foothold in Drustvar. You will be assisted on this mission by Trade Prince Gallywix. I know, a strange choice, but I am told that there is Azerite in Drustvar, and the Trade Prince was insistent. 
Return to Magni Bronzebeard at the Chamber of Heart and learn about the fate of the Forge of Origination.	Forging Onward	Thanks fer helpin' me back there at the forge. It's vexin' that N'Zoth was able to infiltrate it so quickly, but at least we arrived in time tae keep it from bein' completely wrecked! Now comes the task of gettin' her back tae a hundred percent. MOTHER has been workin' on a solution, and we think we've got a plan. 
Meet with Sylvanas in Orgrimmar.	They Move Against Us	The Dark Lady requests your presence in Orgrimmar, George. It seems the rats have finally come out of hiding. Which will make it all the easier to exterminate them. Do not delay. We have waited for this moment long enough. 
Speak with MOTHER to return to the Halls of Origination in Uldum to discover the source behind the anomaly.	Deeper Into the Darkness	This recent change of events allows us to continue our journey to discover what darkness lies beyond the sands. It will not be easy, George. We stand on the precipice of the unknown, but now the tables have turned.<Wrathion glances at your new attire.>You do dress the part. Let's see what insights your return to the Halls of Origination bring to light. 
Meet Kelsey Steelspark in Freehold.	Loose Ends	Our campaign against the Horde is going strong, but there are some loose threads to take care of. Lady Ashvane was broken out of Tol Dagor - by the Horde. We don't know where she's gone or what she is planning. I sent Kelsey out to track down some Ashvane Loyalists to get answers. She found them and has requested backup. She's waiting for you in Freehold. 
Offer to investigate the missing Kul Tiran fleet.	Stormsong Valley	The Kul Tiran fleet has been lost at sea. The tidesages of Stormsong, with their mystical oceanic magic, may be our only way to locate the fleet of legend. 
Support your allies in Nazjatar by gaining 2400 experience combined between Vim Brineheart, Poen Gillbrack, and Neri Sharpfin.	Down But Not Out	Ashvane won't trouble us for now, but our situation remains perilous. I must consider our next move, George. In the meantime we should continue to build upon our relationship with our new allies, the Unshackled. Test them in combat, train them while you can, we will need their aid in the battles to come. We will show them that through unity there are no obstacles that can stand in our way. 
Defeat Lord Stormsong in the Shrine of the Storm.	Shrine of the Storm: Whispers Below	We must not let Lord Stormsong finish his work. If he delivers the fleet to Azshara, all of Kul Tiras will be vulnerable. Countless innocents will perish -- or worse. There is no time to wait for more of the Storm's Wake to arrive. We finish this now, for the good of all who call this valley home. We finish this for Samuel. 
Spy on the denizens of Bridgeport.	Bridgeport Investigation	While you're in Bridgeport, you might keep an ear out for any information that will be of aid to us. You'd be surprised what you can learn by staying quiet and listening to people who think they're alone... 
Meet Magni Bronzebeard in the Chamber of Heart.	Where the Heart Is	The Speaker has requested that I send you to aid him and Wrathion in their efforts. You have proven yourself a great ally to Azeroth, and I suspect you will have a big part to play in the coming battles. Let us hope that the rest of the Horde and Alliance can put aside their squabbles to face a common enemy. 
Meet with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn and Magni Bronzebeard in the Chamber of Heart.	A Friendly Face	An essence of black dragonflight magic is not to be trifled with, George. My flight has been the pawn of dark forces in the past. I owe it to my fallen kin to see that our power is never used for evil again. I would like to journey with you and meet your allies. Perhaps my knowledge can help you use this essence to defend our world. 
Open Harlan Sweete's Strongbox.	Sweete's Strongbox	You've got the keys, and Taelia's still watching our backs. So let's head up to Sweete's, ah, ""office"" and liberate the documents in that strongbox. Come on, it's across the bridge with the rest of his treasure. 
Discuss strategy with Halford Wyrmbane and Shandris Feathermoon.	The Vol'dun Plan	Our target: Arlethal Sunwatcher, High Examiner of the Reliquary. Before we charge off blindly into the dunes, however, I'd like to hold a quick strategy meeting with you and the others. 
Talk to Eitrigg to start researching an upgrade.	Adapting Our Tactics	This war will not be won with strength and might alone. Take in your surroundings while you fight and turn it into an advantage against the enemy. I have a list of modifications for you to choose from. Any one of these might feel small on its own, but together they might just be all the advantage we need. Let me know what you would like us to pursue. 
Tend to Kua'fon until he is ready to fly.	Nature Versus Nurture	Greetings, George. I am Wingminder Goja. I overheard the ordeal that Pa'ku has laid at your feet. I can help you. I oversee this roost at my loa's pleasure. I have seen many eggs become glorious beasts of war. It will be a long road ahead, with many trials to overcome, but de companionship of a pterrordax be a worthy reward. For now, de little one is young. Simply tend to his needs while he stays in de nest. When he is ready to take on de world he will let you know. Good luck, George. 
Complete the dungeon, ""Darkmaul Citadel"".	Dungeon: Darkmaul Citadel	Gor'groth seeks to raise a powerful dragon, Ravnyr, from the dead. He's collected enough life essence to attempt to finish the ritual... even if it means Ravnyr will not be at her full strength. Gor'groth will not stop until he is slain! You must storm the citadel and slay Gor'groth before he can complete his ritual! I would charge in beside you, were I not still recovering from his dark magic. 
Travel to Zo'bal Ruins and speak with Hanzabu.	We'll Meet Again	Now, it be time for ya ta leave. Dere be many of dem blood troll souls for ya ta be sendin' to da Other Side for Bwonsamdi, and ya not gonna find any more of dem here. 
Walk with Magni and retrieve Fearbreaker in Stormwind Keep.	Return of the Warrior King	Ye've done a great deal fer Azeroth, hero, but unfortunately I'm gonna have tae ask ye tae do more. N'Zoth is on the loose, an there's no tellin' when or where he'll strike. This battle is one ye can't face alone. When the time comes, ye'll have my hammer at yer side! But first, we'll need tae fetch it. 
Find the Anodized Sentry Fish, Jarmouthed Goby and the Suction Tube.	Fishing For Something Bigger	There's a huge fish lurking these waters, and it's been causing lots of problems! It eats other fish, fishermen, and a lot of expensive gear. I saw it swallow a beautiful Zigby 300 Fishing Rod along with its owner just the other day! I've got a plan, but I've lost a lot of my equipment in the waters around here. Can you help fish up some of these items for me? 
Grab Marshal M. Valentine's body, as well as the body of the other sailor aboard his ship.	Grab and Go	Nothin' left to do but grab that Marshal and bring him back up to the surface, then. Though I guess you might as well search the shipwreck for anything else of value. You spent all that time gettin' down there, and time is money. 
Fire Flynn's Pistol at the Water Barrel in the Harbormaster's Office.	The Smoking Gun	The Ashvane Company doesn't know it yet, but throwing you into Tol Dagor was the biggest mistake they've ever made. That new powder we swiped could be the key to bringing them down. First, how about we give everyone a little demonstration of just how powerful this stuff is?<Flynn loads a pinch of the glittering powder into his pistol.>Go ahead, take a shot at that barrel over there. 
Take the Pterrordax Egg to Pa'ku at Pterror Rise.	A Child of Pa'ku	<The pterrordax egg is warm and trembling. It will hatch soon.>Perhaps a certain pterrordax loa can help you. 
Rescue 3 captive excavators.	Exterminate the Vermin	On top of the fury of the overseer, and this ""key"" not being here, we have a pest problem. Sneaky little vulperan thieves keep ransacking our site. We have taken some prisoner. We have them around the upper level of the dig site, working off their misdeeds. However, I believe a more permanent solution would be preferred. Please, oh mighty cobra, give us the honor of getting rid of our prisoners with your most potent venom! 
Find Nathanos at the dock in Plunder Harbor.	Catching a Ride	Nathanos should have found a boat by now. Let us hasten to meet him in the harbor. It behooves us to take care of this business quickly. There are better ways for us to support the Horde's effort here. 
Enter the Dream Portal and guide Tess.	Let Sleeping Wolves Lie	Tess's essence now wanders a section of the Emerald Dream I have twisted into her thoughts. And I have given her my gift, but she could still use a guide. Enter the Dream through the portal behind me. It will place you near where she sleeps. See if you can help show her how rage may blind a mortal. 
Bring the Mysterious Mogu Sigil to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	The Mysterious Sigil	<The slain mogu clutches a sigil in his hand -- a symbol of the mysterious clan he belongs to. Perhaps if you could track down his clan, they may know more about the mantid's invasion of Mogu'shan Vaults and how they can be overcome. Lorewalker Cho is well known as font of lore for Pandaria. He may be able to track down the origins of the mogu's sigil.> 
Travel to Highmountain and investigate the essence.	A Disturbance Beneath the Earth	Manifestation of dragon essence detected. Location: Highmountain. Assuming successful retrieval, calculations indicate 92. 7 percent probability of empowering Heart of Azeroth. Theory: By combining dragon essence with sufficient quantities of Azerite within Heart Forge, previously undiscovered abilities may manifest within Heart. As Speaker Magni would say: ""Get to work, champion."" 
Climb the burning house and rescue Scratchy.	Cat on a Hot Copper Roof	My parents said we have to go, but I won't leave Scratchy behind! She's so gentle and precious and pure and kind and soft and cuddly! She must be so scared up there on the balcony! Please help her! 
Speak to Beastlord L'kala in Warbeast Kraal.	An Unending Sleep	<The direhorn hatchling continues to sleep soundly, despite any efforts on your part to wake it. It's probably been too long. You should speak to Beastlord L'kala.> 
Meet with Jaina Proudmoore in Xibala in Zuldazar.	The Abyssal Scepter	The Lord Admiral has proposed our next move. It's something we don't think the Horde will expect, but it's dangerous: We're going to steal back the Abyssal Scepter. Your name came up as someone who could see it through, if you're willing to take the chance. Meet Lady Jaina at our base in Xibala. She'll have more information for you there. 
Defeat Killclaw the Terrible.	Killclaw the Terrible	<You see a crude sign made by the ogres. It contains a warning.>BIG bear! Bad! Big bear guard big ogre treasure! Kill after ritual! Get treasure, make more power! 
Bring the carapace to Kilix the Unraveler in Dragonblight.	Vorus'arak's Carapace	<The carapace from the nerubian lord Vorus'arak, it looks ancient. It appears that Vorus'arak did not want to shed his shell, and instead wore the same scarred carapace for a very long time. All across the carapace, strange markings have been carved. It seems to be a language of some kind.> 
Speak with Spiritwalker Ussoh.	Visions of Danger	George, Spiritwalker Ussoh has revealed a disturbing vision to me regarding Baine Bloodhoof. He has asked that you speak with him as soon as you can. Return to me after. We will have much to discuss. 
Destroy the three Corrupting Pylons in the underwater caves in Krakenbane Cove.	Deep Sea Defilement	The sea...I understand its screams now. It is as if a veil has been lifted, revealing the chaos that has taken hold. Corrupting such a vast swath of sea cannot be done with simple spells. The cultists must have erected some sort of structures to channel their dark magics through...You must find and destroy them, George. Only then can we hope to restore the waters to balance. 
Plant 4 Remote-Detonation Deathbombs beneath the Breath of Pa'ku.	Sabotaging the Pa'ku	Our first job is to plant some bombs along these ships. I'll take care of the smaller ships, you deal with the Breath of Pa'ku. Whatever that means. Kelsey says these bombs are the latest in gnome technology. We plant 'em and she can detonate them at any time. Let's get moving, and remember, this whole plan works as long as they don't see us plantin' these bombs. 
Speak with Ulfar in Ulfar's Den.	The Old Bear	I cannot change your mind, can I? Very well, I may know where you can find your answers. High in the mountains, there is a hidden alcove of impossibly verdant growth. It is there that the druids of Kul Tiras train in the old ways of the Drust - from before the time of Gorak Tul. Their leader is a great bear named Ulfar. I know little about him, but few are more qualified to parse the magic of the Drust. You will find a path to his den along Highroad Pass. Good luck, Inquisitor. 
Use the Kul Tiras Campaign Map to review the final foothold.	The Final Foothold	We have established two critical footholds in Kul Tiras. The time has come to establish the third. Let's review the battle plan when you're ready. 
Find and slay 9 Crimson Cultists in the Terrace of the Chosen.	Forbidden Practices	You come at a good time, $p. I have need of a weapon such as yourself. Yazma's spies say dere are blood cultists in our ranks. King Rastakhan has charged me with tracking down any trolls guilty of practicing blood magic and purging dem. Take dis totem, route out those with de stench of blood magic, and cleanse dem from dis holy place. When you are done, tell dat lazy Hexlord Raal to get off his perch and help keep dis place secure. 
Go to Stormsong and speak with Brother Pike at Kraken's Reach.	A Forlorn Hope	<Lady Katherine's jaw sets.>I refuse to believe I am too late. No one has ever come back from Fate's End, but if anyone could survive I have to believe it would be my Jaina. Go to Stormsong Valley and secure transit to Fate's End from the tidesages. Brother Pike is a good place to start. Hurry, George. 
Challenge 4 Amani Disciples.	Punishment of Tal'aman	Look, Zolani is going about dis all wrong. If you want de Amani, or anyone, to pay attention, take out their leaders. Go into Tal'aman and look for their mighty gong. Challenge four of their disciples to combat and slay dem. 
Speak to MOTHER in the Chamber of Heart.	MOTHER Knows Best	Now that this chamber's not fallin' tae pieces anymore, we can focus on makin' the Heart stronger! MOTHER says she's finished her fancy calculations. Have a word with her, champion. See if we can further empower the amazin' gift Azeroth gave ye. 
Command the Horde army to attack Norwington Manor.	The Fury of the Horde	The Norwington Estate has a large cache of Azerite, along with the Alliance's latest Azerite weapons. We need to steal these weapons and all of their Azerite. Every weapon stolen is a Horde life saved. When you are ready to strike, let me know. I shall signal our warriors to begin the assault. The Alliance and Kul Tirans will see the true might of the Horde! 
Collect the ingredients for Stone Soup in Mistfall Cleft.	Stone Soup	On the surface of the rock you find carvings of what you make out to be ingredients. If you find the ingredients, perhaps you can make the troggs' soup for yourself. 
Collect gunpowder, cannonballs, and a torch, then fire the cannons.	Broadside Bedlam	<The ship's cannons are currently pointed at the other Forsaken ship across the water. However, it appears the crew hasn't loaded them with gunpowder or cannonballs yet... Probably to avoid any accidental firings while they're anchored here. Yes, it'd be a real shame if ""accidental"" cannon fire damaged the other ship.> 
Obtain a Fading Umbral Wand and use it to put out 4 flames around Warfang Hold.	Douse the Flames	Do you smell it, George? Smoke! They're burning down Warfang Hold! There is little point to our battle if our base burns to the ground! Their tidesages use wands to control their constructs of water. In our hands they may give us a chance to save the Hold! Get those wands and put out the fires before the camp burns to ash! 
Acquire 20 Shred of Insanity. These can be looted from bosses in Ny'alotha and World Bosses, obtained by winning Battlegrounds and Arenas, or from Honorable Kills.	Maintaining Focus	At present, the focus holds but a fraction of N'Zoth's true power. If we further empower it, we could craft even more effective weapons to wield against him. N'Zoth's influence is everywhere, George, and is most concentrated within powerful foes. Vanquish them and claim whatever vestiges of the Old God's power remain. 
Accompany Jaina Proudmoore to an audience with Katherine Proudmoore.	Daughter of the Sea	They're not letting us any closer to the keep. We'll have to walk from here. Returning to Boralus has stirred feelings I thought I'd left behind. Memories smoothed away by the years like stones in the tide. It all feels raw again. I do not know how this will end--only that we must try. 
Obtain 8 crates of Ashvane Explosives.	Ammunition Acquisition	First: we get as much of that gunpowder as we possibly can. Imagine the terror in the Kul Tirans' eyes when they realize the Horde has turned their own weapons against them. Imagine it, George.<Lilian's eyes briefly glaze over, and the corner of her lips turns upward in a half-smile.> 
Aid Zelling in retrieving the Abyssal Scepter from Stormsong Monastery.	Gaining the Upper Hand	We need to retrieve the Abyssal Scepter and get out of here before the Kul Tirans break our line in Plunder Harbor. I did some research while you were gone. I believe I uncovered the location where the ritual must take place. When you are ready to go, we can make our way over. 
Reach Master Gadrin in the Echo Isles.	Zalazane Returns	George, I have never needed your help as much as I do this day. My home be under attack. I only just heard myself. Master Gadrin be callin' for aid. Zalazane, an old enemy of da Darkspear, has returned to da Echo Isles and has brought with him an army of da dead. Zalazane be a traitor who has slain many Darkspear and defiled their souls. Will you come with me to defeat him? We can take da ship dat departs da Port of Zandalar. 
Activate the braziers of Xal'vor and defeat Aiji the Accursed.	An Ancient Curse	<The harsh conditions of Nazmir have not been kind to the stone tablet. Most of the inscriptions have been worn away but you are able to make out a picture that shows a chest surrounded by glyphs. Above the chest you noticed what appears to be a large floating skull. Below the images you find a single word ""Aiji"". The ruins ahead seem foreboding, and you may want to bring some friends to help you. With their help, perhaps you can find the secret of this ""Aiji"" and its treasure within.> 
Witness Tyrande's address to the kaldorei.	A New Hope	Darkshore belongs to our people once more, in no small part due to your efforts. And, while I disagree with her methods, we would not have succeeded without Tyrande as well. Differences aside, she is our leader--and an incarnation of the Night Warrior herself. She is about to begin. You may stand here beside me. 
Speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth to sail to Zuldazar.	Bringing Down the Fleet	This is it, George. We've weakened the Horde enough to make a daring strike on Zuldazar itself. Our forces in Zuldazar still remain hidden, thanks to the help of the Dark Iron dwarves. That gives us our chance to strike. Set sail to Zuldazar. We will be gathering our forces there for a coordinated strike to weaken their harbor defenses. 
Hack a projector to display the Rustbolt Resistance emblem and defend it.	Send My Father a Message	My people are once again safe... for now. King Mechagon won't stop sending his armies at us as long as he does not fear us. We must send him a message. Climb to the top of the ramparts, and hack one of my father's projectors to proudly shine the banner of the Rustbolt Resistance big enough for the whole island to see. I'm sure that'll attract the attention of my father, King Mechagon. 
Complete the ""Stay of Execution"" Scenario.	Stay of Execution	Baine's time is short. We must act now. 
Offer to investigate the Ashvane Trading Company.	Tiragarde Sound	We must convince Katherine Proudmoore to pledge Kul Tiras to the Alliance. Flynn believes the Ashvane Trading Company's new gunpowder is our best lead. 
Eliminate 12 Troggs.	Playtime's Over	The troggs have been raiding our supplies since we got here, but now that we got some fire power you're going to put a stop to that! Let's teach them troggs to stay away from our stuff! 
Sabotage Vol'jamba's precautions.	Enforcing Fate	Vol'jamba is busy consolidating his power. His Sight has shown him dat he will fight, and perhaps even dat he will die, and so he looks to all his tools to save himself. I will need you to be my hands, as he will come as soon as I show myself. You will undo all de preparations he has made for dis day. Do as I say and we will both find ourselves enjoying de king's favor. 
Destroy 4 Captured Cannons.	Cease Fire!	The enemy has turned our forward cannons around on us. Scuttle that equipment to stop the bombardments! 
Investigate the anomaly in the Halls of Origination.	Investigating the Halls	Whatever's happenin' has tae be comin' from deep within the inner chamber. If we can get tae the forge maybe we'll find some answers. Best check yer gear 'fore headin' in, George. Who knows what's waitin' fer us in there. 
Administer the remedy to your direhorn.	Held For Observation	<Trader Alexxi hurriedly combines the ingredients.>That should do it. Go on and get this down your direhorn's gullet. Don't worry, nothing could possibly go wrong with a concoction made under any kind of duress. Also, do I seem like the kind of goblin who would give you something dangerous? On purpose?... Don't answer that. Hurry, before they stab me. 
	Sandswept Bones	 
Meet with Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar.	The Dark Lady Calls	Champion, the Dark Lady has need of you. We cannot speak more of this here. Make haste to Orgrimmar at once. Best not to keep her waiting. 
Collect Torn Pages of ""Fear and Flesh"" from Corrupted or Lost Areas within Horrific Visions for Wrathion in the Chamber of Heart.	"Reconstructing ""Fear and Flesh"""	Another tome written by one lost to N'Zoth's madness. I dread to think of what vile words await us within it. But if we are to strengthen your cloak, then we must know more of that which it was meant to resist. See if you can find the remaining pages so that we can complete this tome and make use of the knowledge it holds. 
Rescue Flynn from the Ring of Booty.	"Fairwind's ""Friends"""	Someone must have recognized Flynn and ratted him out! A bunch of Irontide thugs dragged him off to the Ring of Booty for a ""special audience"" with Captain Harlan Sweete. Flynn doesn't like to talk about this, but he used to captain his own crew. With Harlan as his First Mate. The two had a falling out after a messy job and Flynn lost all taste for freebooting. Just disappeared one day. Harlan took the nastiest of the crew and formed the Irontide Raiders. In other words; it's personal. 
Find Rosaline Madison.	Besieged Allies	Seawalls can be rebuilt, but lives are lost for good. We need to secure the rest of the people here first. The Outriggers have been known as some of the fiercest hunters in these waters. Find their leader, Rosaline Madison, and enlist her aid in liberating Anglepoint. Together, clear the north shore of the Horde, save anyone in danger, and rally the dock workers. You handle the north shore, George. I will handle the south. We'll meet in the middle and crush the Horde between us. 
Retrieve the Abyssal Scepter from the Zandalari Treasury.	The Treasury Heist	The Abyssal Scepter is a powerful tidesage artifact and a serious threat to the fleet. The Horde stole it, but it is being held by the Zandalari in their treasury. The Storm's Wake has crafted a fake Scepter. Your first job is to obtain the real one without alerting suspicion. Speak to me when you are ready to go over the plan. 
Kill Blood Prince Dreven.	Ending the San'layn Threat	Blood Prince Dreven has barricaded himself in the lowest deck of this ship. He's trapped down there. Don't think that makes this easy for us. A cornered beast is more dangerous than a free one. But, if we have the will and wisdom, he can be slain. Follow me. I will break the barrier blocking his lair and we will face him together. 
Find Nisha on the southern coast of Zuldazar.	On the Outskirts	If things are settled for the Commander, you should check in on Nisha. I'm sure she could use your help. 
Kill 12 Proudmoore Guard on The Siren's Daughter and The Valorous Rose. Hobart Grapplehammer can fly you out to the ships.	The Bulk of the Guard	If all has gone according to plan, Proudmoore has sent her elite forces to recapture her son's body. Let's make sure they stay out of the way of our real mission, hmm? 
Report to King Anduin Wrynn in Stormwind Keep.	A Short-Lived Peace	George,As the Legion's presence wanes from our world, a new threat has risen. It is with a heavy heart that I must ask you to put your life on the line for the Alliance once more. I have received a disturbing message from our operatives stationed in Orgrimmar. I await your arrival at Stormwind Keep to discuss matters further. 
Listen to Nathanos' plan, then travel to Plunder Harbor.	When a Plan Comes Together	Having Derek Proudmoore's body in our possession is a greater boon than we had planned for. Valentine is risen, but I think it best to allow Derek to lay dead for a bit longer. It's time to use our new allies to our advantage. 
Find Private James and free him from his captors.	Breaking Free	Look, these guys are in a tough spot but let's not lose track of the mission. We've got to rescue Private James! I saw a bunch of cages down in the camp of those snakes that are besieging the temple. If James is going to be anywhere, then it'll be there! 
	Chag's Challenge	 
Repel the Hordes forces assaulting Tiragarde Sound.	A Sound Defense	Horde forces are attacking Tiragarde Sound. Make them regret every footstep upon our soil! 
Retrieve 5 Stolen Crates.	Steal Them Back	<This empty crate of supplies is clearly marked with Kul Tiran signage. These must be the spoils of their raids on the farms of the valley. The citizens would probably like their supplies back if there are any left.> 
Take a hit from Varok Saurfang, then report to Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar.	Queen's Favor	I have two things to ask of you, and I do not ask them lightly. First, I need you to retain the favor of the warchief. She will undoubtedly have questions, and seeds of distrust may begin to grow, but she cannot lose you as an ally. Not now. She would not so willingly part with one of her greatest champions. In order to do so, it will have to look like you faced me in combat, and lost. I trust you can take a hit. Second, I ask you not to follow me further. I must make this journey alone. 
Meet with Baine Bloodhoof at Plunder Harbor in Tiragarde Sound.	Righting Wrongs	Champion! I come with an urgent request from Baine Bloodhoof. He asks that you meet him at Plunder Harbor to help him with a... sensitive situation. You must tell no one of this request, Mechanic. Ancestors watch over you. 
Support your allies in Nazjatar by gaining 3000 experience combined between Farseer Ori, Hunter Akana, and Bladesman Inowari.	Friends In Need	I doubt that will be the last we've seen of Priscilla, but at least she is no longer one of our immediate concerns. We must think carefully before making our next move. In the meantime we should continue to build upon our relationship with our new allies, the Ankoan. Work with them to secure the area and hone their skills, we're not out of the woods yet. I fear the biggest battle is still to come. Let's show them that together we can take on Azshara's forces and succeed! 
	Champion: Shandris Feathermoon	 
Clear the pass of boulders, mines, and other obstructions between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar.	This Ain't Mine	Sylvanas's loyalists have collapsed part of the canyon path to Orgrimmar. Our forces are now cut off from each other. We need to reinforce our front line or the Banshee will pick us off at her leisure. We have come too far to be slain by a thousand cuts. Gazlowe and one of the Alliance's gnomes believe they have an answer. You'd best ensure that their plan does not backfire. 
Ride Swiftwing to accompany Falstad and Shandris to the Great Sea.	Hunting Blood Prince Dreven	Between the information I gathered from my scouting mission and Mathias Shaw's intel, we know exactly where Blood Prince Dreven is going to be. We will have our revenge, $p. For ourselves, for my sisters, for the Alliance. We won't underestimate the san'layn this time. We will keep the Horde off-balance and distracted with swift, targeted, ruthless attacks. Thankfully, the Wildhammer are masters of those combat tactics. I'm glad they'll be joining us. Are you ready to leave? 
Ride with Taelia to Vigil Hill.	Defenders of Daelin's Gate	Daelin's Gate has protected the southern channel for decades. If it falls, the pirate fleet can sail straight into Tiragarde Sound! The marines at Vigil Hill will need our help. Let's go! 
	Calligraphy	 
Slay Dark Chronicler	WANTED: Dark Chronicler	Champion wanted for an expedition into the depths of Xibala. Strange noises and wails come from the bones at night and our workers are terrified. Seek out the source of the strange noises and destroy it, and a reward will be yours. 
Cleanse the 3 Statues of Rezan.	House of the King	I hear Rezan's call. I will answer, but first you must help me. Our loa give us many boons, and we repay dem in worship. Offerings, sacrifices, and idols are our tools to earn favor, but dey are much more to our loa. Dey are sources of strength. Zul's dogs have begun to corrupt de great golden statues dedicated to Rezan. Even now, I can feel his power dwindling. Stop dem. Cleanse de idols to de great hunter. Teach dem to respect de house of de king. 
Find and kill War Gore	WANTED: War Gore	By the decree of the Storm's Wake. Scouts have reported that forsaken scientists have created a monster, sewn together from the bodies of our own fallen soldiers. This monstrosity is called, War Gore. The individual that destroys this abomination will earn a fitting reward. 
Escape Tol Dagor with Flynn.	Out Like Flynn	I'm relieved you woke up! Having to carry you would have made this job far less appealing. The name's Flynn, and my client in Boralus is paying me a king's bounty to break you out of here. You, my friend, are incarcerated in Tol Dagor. Used to be a legit prison... 'til the Ashvane Trading Company bought it. Now it's Priscilla's own personal fortress, riddled with scum on both sides of the bars. Wasn't hard to bribe my way into this cell. Now we just have to get out. Not to worry. I have a plan! 
Meet Zolani in the Grand Bazaar.	The Port of Zandalar	King Rastakhan has given me orders to investigate de Harbor of Zandalar. De claim Princess Talanji has levied against General Jakra'zet for failing to maintain de safety of our kingdom is a serious accusation. For dis task, I would have you join me so dat I might have an outside perspective. When you are ready, meet me in de Grand Bazaar. 
Rendezvous with Nathanos and Lilian in central Tiragarde Sound.	Into the Heart of Tiragarde	Step one is to establish a more suitable base of operations. A pirate's den will do in a pinch, but I believe the warchief expects better of us. Let's split up and push farther inland, to the west. Be on the lookout for something defensible and inconspicuous. 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Ultrasafe Transporter: Mechagon	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a personal teleporter of some kind. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Speak with Spiritwalker Ussoh to observe the scouting party.	Scouting the Palace	We cannot hide here forever, George. We have to deal with Azshara. We will need to assault her palace but we do not know what defenses she has in place. I dispatched a scouting team while you were gone and they have not reported back. I cannot afford to lose any more people. Speak with Spiritwalker Ussoh. His abilities will let us see where the scouts are. 
Find people and things to inspire 1 new ideas in Mechagon.	Ideas Can Come from Anywhere	I didn't notice the tinkerer's spark in you when we first met. But look at all of the blueprints you've recovered and uploaded to Pascal-K1N6's database. I was wrong. And happily so, my budding junkyard tinkering apprentice! But this is a dangerous moment in your creative development. You must avoid complacency! Take time off to find new ideas. Speak with builders that inspire you, reverse-engineer bots on the island, and be open to new ideas - no matter where they come from! 
Disable the cannons on the Horde ship.	Disarming the Cannons	With your arrival, our salvation may have arrived. Your rowboats will serve as a way for us to evacuate the most critically injured. Unfortunately, the Horde have brought in a ship, and there's no way we can get our boats past their blockade. While the rest of us load our injured on the boats, we need you to infiltrate their ship and disable those cannons. 
Kill Captain Gastrod and Guard-Commander Trunksal on The Siren's Daughter, and Helmsman Miria on the Valorous Rose. Hobart Grapplehammer can fly you out to the ships.	Old Colleagues	The people in charge of those two ships are old colleagues of mine, George. They did not achieve their rank through hard work as I did, but rather through deception and blackmail. I think they deserve the hammer of karma. Or whatever weapon you prefer. 
Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.	Vinyl: Triumph of Gnomeregan	<This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Triumph of Gnomeregan.""You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.> 
Slay Vindictive Sentinels and Archers and command Brynja to raise them as Dark Rangers.	Dark Ranger Round-Up	These night elf ambushes have left us undermanned. We need reinforcements if we are to hold Darkshore. Brynja, one of the Dark Lady's val'kyr, can provide us with those reinforcements. Slay the night elves and command her to raise them into our service. Should any prove unwilling... deal with them. Did I not make myself clear? Go. The Dark Lady has plans for these dark rangers. 
Speak with a 7th Legion Mage in the Sanctum of the Sages.	Sanctum of the Sages	Sounds like you'll be working with us for awhile. Cyrus will charter a naval transport between here and Stormwind, but I expect you'll want something a bit faster for day to day use. Head back upstairs and take a left when you get outside. You'll find an old study where the Tidesages used to conduct their magic rituals. Surely your Alliance mages have already sensed its power. Inform them they may open their portals there. The harbor guards will keep the room secure. 
	Taptaf the Pig!	 
Report to Nathanos Blightcaller in Zuldazar.	Time for War	You should return to Nathanos Blightcaller to begin working with The Honorbound. 
Accompany Brann to Fort Victory in Nazmir.	Heart of Darkness	We sent troops with Captain Conrad ahead to Nazmir to gain a foothold in that hellish jungle. The reports we've been receiving of the local troll population are... disconcerting. They're in over their heads, George. I have Brann Bronzebeard prepped and ready to head out. Accompany Brann to Nazmir so we can secure our position. The Wind's Redemption is at your disposal. 
Confront Lizzarik in Ratchet.	Venture Co. Business Plan	<An enormous volume, and printed in very small print. You can't make it through even a few sentences before the words begin to swim before your eyes. The Venture Company's long-term plan appears to be quite complex and nearly impossible to understand. One thing is for certain: a competing enterprise would likely pay well to get their hands on this tome.> 
Support your allies in Nazjatar by getting one to rank 3.	Down Into Nazjatar	We have much to do George. However our troops are weary and need rest. Decisions made when tired are often the wrong ones. These ""Unshackled"" have offered to aid us with what forces they have. If we hope to survive down here against Azshara's forces, we will need to support our new allies. Join one of their hunters and aid them in their tasks, we will remain here and discuss our next move. 
Investigate Mardivas's Laboratory.	Legacy of the Mad Mage	<This rather large jewel has an inscription etched on its base:Property of Mardivas. If found please return to my laboratory. Perhaps this laboratory can still be found somewhere?> 
Speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth and travel to Xibala.	The Void Elves Stand Ready	Bal'a dash, $p. Alleria and the others have informed me of your many accomplishments here in Kul Tiras. I'm honored to join you on this mission. As a representative for the void elves, I am eager to prove to King Anduin that his trust in us was well-placed. Forgive me, do not allow me to delay you. Alleria and the others can brief me on the mission as we travel. You may tell the Grand Admiral that we are ready to set sail whenever you like. 
Speak with Ensign Josey to send a message to Katherine, then meet her at Gol Inath in the Crimson Forest.	Into Darkness	I didn't think you would find a way. Though at this point, I guess I shouldn't be surprised when you accomplish what seems impossible. I guess all that is left is to brave the Crimson Forest and see if this thing works. First, however, Katherine has ordered me to send word when you have found a way to Jaina. You can use one of our falcons to take a message to her. 
Acquire 200 Shred of Insanity. These can be looted from bosses in Ny'alotha and World Bosses, obtained by winning Battlegrounds and Arenas, or from Honorable Kills.	Dream Catcher	It appears that the focus remains stable, and its containment field remains intact. I daresay we can empower it even further. Hunt down and defeat formidable enemies to acquire additional remnants of N'Zoth's influence. This time, we will infuse the focus with even greater amounts of the Old God's power. I am confident that the containment field will continue to hold. 
Meet with Lucille Waycrest at Arom's Stand in Drustvar.	Of Myth and Fable	If Jaina is truly trapped in the Blighted Lands, that could mean we're not too late! We just need to find a way inside...We will need to enlist the help of Lucille Waycrest. The legends of that place are deeply rooted in Drustvar's culture. If anyone would know more about it, it would be she. I will send a raven ahead for her to prepare what knowledge she can gather. Make haste to Arom's Stand! 
Meet with Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus Harbor.	Operation: Heartstrike	We've taken out quite a number of high priority targets, George. All thanks to your help. It is time to strike directly at the heart of the Zandalari empire. Report to the Wind's Redemption as soon as you are able. We will get started from there. 
Identify the captains of the three nearby ships.	Captain By Captain	Seems like you're on your own. More shipwrecks lie along the bottom of the sea. This must have been the location of a major battle. Time to start checking dog tags to find Marshal Valentine. 
Destroy the stockpiles of supplies.	Run For the Hills	The quilboar are up to something, something big. You need to stop it! They've been busy bringing supplies up to the caves above their sanctum. Preserved thorns, cauldrons of venom, giant totems...They're preparing for war. Get up there and destroy those stockpiles before they can be used against the citizens of the valley! 
Find Samuel Williams.	From the Maw of Madness	Sam is still out there somewhere. We can't just leave him to die! If he wasn't in the assembly yard, he must be on that ship. You have to find him! 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Critters are Friends, Not Food	 
""Improve"" 2 concoctions prepared by the Atal'Jamba acolytes.	Needs a Little Body	I am here primarily to deal with my wayward student. His followers, however, I will leave to you. I have seen a possible future dat is... concerning. Rivers running red with poison, dead filling de streets. And dese... ""Jambani"" asserting themselves as de new rulers of Zuldazar. Dis cannot come to pass. Fortunately for you, I know how to avoid dat fate. I think you will find their cauldrons are missing one key ingredient.<He stares at you.>Something to give it a little body, perhaps? 
Seek out Wrathion outside the Karazhan Catacombs.	To the Catacombs!	I held out as long as I could, but... the whispers were too strong. You must hurry to Karazhan. The Black Prince said he intended to study the artifacts stored within its catacombs. Please, do not allow my failure to bring about his doom! 
Board the Expedition Gyrocopter.	The Start of Something Bigger	We have coordinates locked into the gyrocopters. You and Captain Winklespring will fly the lead. If we run into any trouble, Tinkmaster Overspark wants the most experienced pilots out front. Board whenever you are ready to go. 
Eliminate 5 Venture Co. Transports	Taking The Air Out	<This box of rockets could just be used to take out the Venture Co. Balloons. That would really motivate Venture Co. to go somewhere else.> 
Attempt to find Wrathion in Blackrock Mountain.	Unscarred Black Scale	<An utterly pristine black dragon scale taken from the dragons you recently encountered. The black dragonflight was completely decimated following Deathwing's demise and Wrathion's rise to power. Yet the size indicates a younger dragon. There is one person, one dragon, that you know will want to hear of this, but where IS Wrathion? You surmise he may be some place familiar, fortified, and abandoned.> 
Sail down the river with Talanji and defend the Gob Squad's A.M.O.D.	Down by the Riverside	We have de aid of Krag'wa and de Gob Squad. We must get back to Zul'jan and begin our plan to stop de blood trolls. We have one problem. De Gob Squad are unable to move their mech fast enough in de jungle. We must take it by boat. De two of us will ride with dem and ensure de blood trolls do not destroy de mech. I will run ahead and get de boat ready near de riverbank. Meet us dere. 
Collect Windcaller Ula'jan's skull aboard the flagship Rastakhan's Might.	Rastakhan's Might	Do you see de ship out in de bay, George? Dat is my flagship, Rastakhan's Might. It is not here under my orders. We will deal with de Prophet Zul in good time. For now, those who took my vessel must pay. You are to bring me de head of Windcaller Ula'jan. De ship does not move without him, and it will not be moving again once he is dead! 
Use the Ashvane Cannon to destroy 6 Ashvane Co. Supplies. Azerite Cannonballs are required to fire the cannon.	Loaded for Bear	<This glittering cannonball stands out from the others. You notice the familiar sheen of Azerite across the surface. You can't help but notice the nearby cannon, conveniently pointed at the ships loaded with stores of Ashvane Company weapons.> 
Follow Jol's directions to assist in healing King Rastakhan.	Mending Body and Soul	Good. You have brought me the last ingredients I will need to concoct a solution to close the king's wounds. You are not a moment too soon. He is fading. I am not comfortable working at an elevated pace, but the situation requires it. You must be my hands, for I am very slow. Bring me what I need, and let Jamil and I worry about the rest. Speak to me when you are ready to begin. 
Use Flynn's Spyglass.	Freehold	Well, there she is: Freehold. You can get anything you want there, provided you can pay for it. Whether you pay with gold or steel is up to you. Take a look. 
Mount Cooper to begin your show and score at least 150 points.	Show Me What You've Got	It looks like you understand the basics. Now it's time to put everything together. Head for the ring. Once you hear the starting pistol, you will have one minute to score as high as possible. Gnolls are worth one point. Run 'em through with the harpoon! If you see a paper zeppelin, bag it with your bolas for fifty points! Leaping fences gives you style. Style gives you more points when you skewer gnolls or down zeppelins. It's super important, so don't forget to keep jumping fences! 
Disperse the crowd surrounding Brother Pike.	A Risky Ploy	Things are worse than we thought. These people are about to tear Brennadam apart! We'll never get a chance to talk to Brother Pike in this mess. I have an idea, but if it doesn't work, well... I hope you have your running boots on. Trust me? 
Collect 40 Spare Parts and 1 Energy Cell from enemies in Junkwatt Depot.	We Can Fix It	<This drill rig looks capable of breaking through the nearby debris, but is clearly broken. If you can collect the parts required, Prince Erazmin should be able to show you how to repair it.> 
Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.	Vinyl: Battle of Gnomeregan	<This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Battle of Gnomeragan.""You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.> 
Use the Scroll of Fate's Hand to summon the Hand of Fate to destroy 50 undead along the Blood Coast.	Forcing Fate's Hand	I got some good news and bad news for you about this whole quest to destroy the herald of G'huun. Bad news first. There's an entire army of skeletons between us and the next area. I'm guessing they used Torga's blood to animate them. Good news is that scroll you recovered from Holbruk can summon the powerful Hand of Fate....and the bad news is that the scroll got damaged when Holbruk died and is only good for one more use. Meh. Take this scroll and destroy that skeleton army! 
Meet Vorrik at the Sanctuary of the Devoted.	Sanctuary Under Siege	I fear that Emperor Korthek was not lying when he boasted of his foolish plan. If General Jakra'zet attacked the Sanctuary of the Devoted while we were away, there is a good chance that he now has everything needed to resurrect Mythrax. We must hurry to the Sanctuary and stop Jakra'zet. Mythrax must not be reborn! 
Use the Tangled Rigging to collect the ""Sea Dog"" Grog.	Rig Robbing	I'm out here tryin' to enjoy my break, but I ran outta hooch. Got some grog hidden in the water just off the dock, stashed in a crate tied up to some of the rigging. Do me a favor and fetch it, will ya? Rigging's pretty tangled so you might have to pull in a few lines before you get the right one. I'd do it myself, but if they see me they're gonna force me back to work unloadin' them new weapons. 
Meet with Constable Henry Framer at Hangman's Point in Drustvar.	The Waycrest Daughter	You seek House Waycrest? Oh, your timing could not be worse! I had just received a raven regarding Lord Waycrest's daughter, Lucille, shortly before this... curse came upon us. They apprehended her in Fletcher's Hollow and are taking her to trial. They say she is a witch, herself! If she's found guilty, she will surely hang! You must make haste to Hangman's Point. With what you've seen here, maybe you can convince them of her innocence. 
Fly into the deserts of Vol'dun and search for Warguard Rakera.	Into the Dunes	Whatever Rakera uncovered, it was important enough to earn her a death sentence to de sands. We must head into Vol'dun to find her. We cannot let whatever she knows about Jakra'zet die with her in de dunes. 
Deliver the item to Marvelous Martini.	Paint Vial: Copper Trim	<Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.> 
Take the Delicious Chicken to Dr. Oglethorpe in Booty Bay.	Cutting Edge Poultry Science	<Before you is a delicious chicken... And yet, despite everything, there is something a little bit... lively about this creature. With a judicious application of science, there might be something that can still be done for this poor bird. You resolve to bring the chicken to Dr. Oglethorpe in Booty Bay with all haste.> 
Speak to the Captain.	Sending Out An SOS	I noticed an exodus from the fleet, far out in the harbor. Flyers were sent out, they seek something, or someone. Those ships made a great journey, and they have much work ahead. Please check in with Captain Grez'ko. I am sure he could use a hand! 
Kill Crazzak and free Hexlord Raal.	Raal	Crazzak is a traitor in priest's clothing who thinks if he tortures enough of us it will hurt our loa. Dey even have my husband Raal up on de apex of Zanchul. Normally I would say dey could have him, but dey are using his connection to Pa'ku to weaken de loa. Can't have dat. Let's get to de top of Zanchul and rescue my worthless husband. 
Enter the Karazhan Catacombs and search for a cure for Ebonhorn.	On the Trail of the Black Prince	<It looks like a fight took place here. N'Zoth's agents must have already entered the catacombs beneath Karazhan. The dead lookout still has a set of keys on him. Perhaps they will unlock the door. With any luck, you can find Wrathion before N'Zoth's agents and gain something that can help Ebonhorn.> 
Collect 8 Vials of Honey Slime and mix them with Raimond's Secret Ingredient to make Mildenhall's Growth Formula, then feed it to Bumbles.	Let's Bee Friends	We just need to collect some slime from the animated honey creatures that are still roaming around the farm. If you can bring back a few vials of that, we can put all our ingredients together and give the mixture to Bumbles. We should only feed him once a day, or he might get sick like some of the other bees. We're gonna have him all healed up in no time! 
Meet with Rokhan near flight master Rokota in Dazar'alor.	Journey to Nazmir	It is time to put an end to de blood trolls in Nazmir before their monstrous horde descends upon Zuldazar. My most loyal followers are willing to come with me to dat cursed place. But it will not be enough. I am relieved dat you and de Horde are willing to help. Rokhan and his darkspears are getting ready to leave. I will finish my preparations here. Meet with Rokhan and make your way to Nazmir, I will see you there. 
Seek out Nailok at the Altar of Akunda in the Terrace of the Chosen.	His Eye Upon You	<Talanji seems to regard you with concern.>Dark mojo has fallen upon you, George. I can sense de tendrils of N'Zoth delving deep into your mind. Dis evil must be purged... before it claims your very soul! Go to de Altar of Akunda in de Terrace of de Chosen. Seek out Nailok, one of de priests of Akunda. He is your best chance to be cleansed of de wicked curse dat grips you. 
Bring the fur to Loganaar in Moonglade.	Druidic Fur	<This fur teems with natural magic. The beasts you fought on the island were clearly not beasts at all, but druids. At least they were before. What could have caused them to become feral? You did not want to slay them, but they gave you no choice, didn't they?> 
Use the Scrap-O-Matic 1000 on the pair of Tattered Pants.	A Load of Scrap	Hello, friend. Would you like the scoop on the latest invention of the century? It's called the Scrap-O-Matic 1000 and this device can triple, no QUADRUPLE your production capacity as a crafter of armor, weapons or other gizmos you adventurers wander around with. Here, take these pants and use the Scrap-O-Matic on 'em. You'll get the hang of it. 
Locate Apprentice Odari at Dragon's Teeth Basin.	The Lost Shaman	Pardon me, Mechanic. I am in need of your assistance. Our shaman, Farseer Ori, left the camp some days ago to investigate a nearby disturbance in the elements. He took his apprentice with him, a young initiate named Odari. Neither have returned. I am leading an expedition to find them and return them here safely. Nazjatar is full of dangers. The skills of an accomplished Mechanic like yourself could prove most useful. Will you help me return the lost shaman to safety? 
Help the handlers subdue Pinky.	A Good Spanking	Pinky is contained in de direhorn pen for now, but de handlers are having a real hard time with him! Dis calls for some tough love. Will you help dem? 
Bring three Repeating Wrenchbots to Recycler Kerchunk	Right Bot for the Job	We don't waste anything around here. Every defeated bot gets a second chance! If I'm going to fix this mechaspider, I'm going to need a few extra wrenchbots working with me. Use my Bot Re-Energizer on three dead Repeating Wrenchbots and bring them to me, and I'll put them to work. 
Use the Frost Breath Potion to put out the fires.	Curiously Strong	I imagine the fires spread while I was down here, yes? First order of business then; making sure the town doesn't burn down! Help solve that problem and I shall be free to assist you in... whatever it is? Let's see... Yes! Here! Take these. They proved to be bit too... intense for most people, but you seem like a stout sort. Just be sure you're facing the fires when you use them, and I'm certain those fires will be out in no time! 
Meet Zolani in Zeb'ahari.	The Wounded King	I have things under control here... for now, at any rate. If we want to salvage this situation, Rastakhan must survive. Habutu is gone, but his other guardian, Zolani, has sent word. She is protecting the King at a small fishing village called Zeb'ahari. Find Zolani and do what you can to ensure Rastakhan lives. Be careful, George. 
Speak with King Rastakhan at the Golden Throne.	Trust of a King	Well, now dat you are settled in, you had best go speak with my father. You can find him up upon de throne, his advisors close at hand, pouring poison in his ear, no doubt. De lift behind you can take you to de Golden Throne above us. 
Collect 20 Useful Bits and Pieces	Waste Not	<There's a variety of parts around this area that might be useful to Rustbolt. You should collect them before Venture Co takes them.> 
Meet with Marshal Reade at Watchman's Rise in Drustvar.	The Road to Corlain	Lord and Lady Waycrest lay trapped in Waycrest Manor. Before we can reach them, however, we must brave through the city of Corlain... which is firmly in the grasp of the Heartsbane. Our first course of action should be to set up a forward outpost. Our scouts have found that the tower at Watchman's Rise is only lightly guarded. I recommend we take the tower from them. This is now your command, Inquisitor. Say the word, and we ride. 
Meet with Anduin Wrynn in Stormwind Keep.	Payment in Kind	George, King Anduin has requested our presence in Stormwind. We've sent him reports on our situation here in Nazjatar, and he understands the severity of the threat we're facing. For him to pull both of us back from the front lines, it must be a matter of grave importance. I will meet you in Stormwind Keep. 
Recover DeMeza's father's Sword, Clothing and Bones.	Pirates, Sea Monsters, Robots	I finally found it! This is the resting place of my father, after his crew mutinied and left him here to die. I've scouted the island, and found the locations of three chests that contain mementoes of my father. Do this for me and my family. Recover my father's sword, clothing, and bones from the three chests I've marked. 
	Vinespeaker Ratha	 
	Infestation of Madness	 
Meet Spymaster Mathias Shaw on the Wind's Redemption.	Mission from the King	Och, good ta see ya! Feels great ta stretch me gryphon's wings above the seas. I'm here ta assist with the war effort. Happy to help! Let's go meet with Master Shaw, matey. Ha! Always wanted to say somethin' piratey. Did ya know they named a ship after me once? It was wild! 
Search for Flynn Fairwind.	Lured and Allured	Lookin' for a friend from the wreck, eh? If he survived he may have wandered up the path to our camp. Now if he ain't up there toastin' his buns by the fire, well... lotta poor souls fall victim to the song of the sirens. You should check the camp before you go wadin' out into the tideway. Ask our leader, Stabby Jane. She'd know for sure if a new survivor showed up! 
Collected motes of Stormsurge from defeated elementals.	The Strength of the Storm	The ritual I must conduct is written on a scroll. To gain access to it, you'll have to break through the dark energies the fallen tidesages have placed around it, with the power of the storm. This relic can be used to pull purified power from the enslaved elementals. Not only will you be gaining the means to our end, you will ultimately be freeing these spirits from corruption. Defeat the enslaved elementals and then call their power into the relic. 
	Terror of the Depths	 
Speak with Garona Halforcen to issue a recruitment order.	Reinforcements	The resources you gather can be used to recruit new troops for the war effort. Return to me periodically to issue new recruitment orders for your missions. If you have available resources, you should use them now to issue your first recruitment order. The war effort rages on even as we speak. We have need of fresh recruits. 
Recover 4 Azerite bombs and 3 Azerite rifles.	Machines of War and Azerite	The Norwington Estate... I remember taking walks here with my wife and children. Sorry, this isn't the time for remembering an old life. The Alliance have Azerite bombs and rifles scattered throughout the estate. I believe our goal is to recover them. If only the Alliance hadn't chosen to use the estate as a testing ground... this was meant to be a place of peace. 
Speak with Evelyn Pare at the Timbered Strand in Drustvar.	The Curse of Fletcher's Hollow	It's obvious the constable won't be swayed until we discover what happened at Fletcher's Hollow. I know very little myself--only that the village has been overrun by monstrous creatures. I must ask that you travel there in my stead and try to uncover what befell the village. I'm sure Marshal Reade will prevent the constable from harming me while you're away. Do this for me, and I will help you as I can. 
Retrieve Brother Addington's Tidal Kris, Abyssal Beacon, and Wavecaller's Mantle.	Means to an End	In our haste to journey here I did not think to bring my ritual implements we tidesages use to augment our power. To be honest, I had never expected them necessary on what should have been a peaceful sojourn. Addington does not have his, either. I am sure the militia took him from his home before he had the chance to react. That means his implements should still be in the yard somewhere. We must find them before my power is of much real use. 
Patrol the skies with Hexlord Raal.	Offensively Defensive	Let me guess, Loti had you kill any trolls dat smelled of blood magic, yes? Well, dat is barely a half measure. See, blood magic comes from de old ways, and our people have only been giving in to its allure since de walls fell on our northern border. Come, we will go for a little ride and patrol de border to Nazmir. Dat is where all dese bad ideas are coming from. 
Find the Child of Torcali in the Slough and rescue her from danger.	A Daughter of Torcali	It has long been remarked upon that a direhorn is de bravest beast in de jungle. That is why they are chosen as mounts for our warriors. In this case, that bravery may not be in your favor. De little one has run off and I do not think she is hungry this time. Best find her before she gets hurt. 
Bring the scarab to High Commander Kamses in Uldum.	Glittering Scarab	<A magical trinket found on a tol'vir spellcaster, it appears to augment their casting abilities. It seems to be very old, but is nearly pristine in form. The tol'vir of Uldum may know more about the sudden appearance of the Amathet.> 
	Smoke and Shadow	 
Search Gol'Bolar Quarry for the missing excavation crew.	Keep Yer Feet On The Ground	George! The Explorers League is setting up a new exhibit in the Hall of Explorers, so we sent a team in search of new artifacts to display in it. They headed off to Gol'Bolar Quarry in Dun Morogh, but haven't returned. Would ye mind checking on 'em? 
Escort Flynn to Freehold.	Lovesick and Lost	Ugh. My head. My HEART. Feels like a good hangover and a bad breakup put together. On the bright side, I think I know where we are. And where that ship was headed. Freehold. It's a... free town. For, uh... free folk. The only rule is that there are no rules. Lotta guys with peg legs and eye patches and exotic pets. Catch my drift? There's a trail through the hills that'll take us there. Pretty sure I remember the way...Let's get moving. Gotta walk off that damn siren's witchery. 
Kill the Awakened Guardian.	A Marine Out of Water	A giant one of those stone creatures killed quite a few marines while we were trying to evacuate the cave. It didn't chase us too far, but ignoring it outright is too big of a risk. It needs to fall! 
Speak with Princess Talanji.	Zuldazar	King Rastakhan is an ancient ruler who is not quick to trust new allies. We must earn his trust if we are to earn his fleet. Zuldazar is the seat of power for the Zandalar empire and a good place to start in winning over these potential allies. 
Look for signs of blood trolls ahead with Princess Talanji.	Into The Darkness	We are in Nazmir to stop de blood trolls from destroying Zuldazar. Dis is de start of our campaign to end dem. Dese monsters want my kingdom and its people destroyed. We are going destroy dem first. My father thinks de blood troll threat will go away on its own, like it did in de past. But things are different now. Rokhan and de others are moving north of here to establish a camp for us to stay in, den dey will join us in de fight. Are you ready? 
Obtain the Architect's Cipher from Tideguard Pontus.	The Missing Link	<Though burned, portions of the note in the architect's hand remain legible.>They are... everywhere... disguised...Encrypted... blueprints...Cipher...Pontus... watching me...<The cipher must be needed to read the ship blueprints. It seems Pontus is the likely holder.> 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	Operation: Bottom Feeder	It is time for Zelling to prove his worth to the Horde. Return to the Banshee's Wail. Today, we sail out to open waters. 
Install the gramophone in the Rustbolt bar, The Tipsy Tinkerer.	Rustbolt Gramophone	<The large gramophone that you crafted is capable of blasting music across all of Rustbolt. Now, you just need to find a good place to install it.> 
Find the second relic.	The Pirate's Treasure	I sense another relic. A trident thought lost to the depths. It calls to me, George. Do you hear it too? Its song takes form. I see a harbor to the east. An ambitious pirate, greedy and proud. Completely unaware of the power hidden within her hoard of gold. The would-be-captain's hubris will not permit her to simply hand over her prize. I fear she must be taught a rather harsh lesson. But that is your specialty, is it not? 
Speak to Nathanos Blightcaller to witness the meeting of leaders in Warfang Hold.	A Display of Power	It looks like all the big players are here. This thing's gonna be starting any moment now. You'll probably want to get a good seat. 
Give Jani the Trashmaster's Mantle.	I Am the Trashmaster	Whatcha got there, richmon? Ha! You think you be de Trashmasta? You be talkin' to de God of Garbage! De Ruler of Rubbish! Master of all things Discarded an' Unwanted! So you not be wantin' that ol' trashy cloak, eh? Jani got somethin' better. You just give dat ol' thing to me, an Jani will be takin' care o' you... 
Locate Raimond's Secret Ingredient.	Bumbles the Bee	Hey $p, thanks for delivering Mom's letter. I was really starting to worry about her! Dad and I have been having a few problems running the farm after she left on her trip. If you didn't show up when you did, we'd still be in real trouble! I was hoping you would be willing to help Bumbles out too. He was hurt when his hive was destoyed. If we feed him some of Dad's special formula, hopefully he will heal up faster. First we need to find the secret ingredient, try looking around at his other lab. 
Meet with Tess Greymane at Stormwind Keep.	The Shadow of Gilneas	Champion of Gilneas! I have a letter for you from Princess Tess Greymane. She requests your presence in Stormwind Keep. 
Rescue Lil' Tika.	Lil' Tika	<The tiny armored raptor scratches pitifully at the cage's wooden bars. As you approach, the miniscule reptile wiggles frantically and issues a piercing screech for help! Perhaps you can open the cage and let it free.> 
Locate Arylina's diary.	Forgotten Memories	Have we met before? I'm sorry... but I don't remember your name. My name is... Arylina... I think. My memory has been so foggy since the great explosion happened that sent us underwater. Oh! But look! I can see the sun and the stars again... I wonder what happened? I used to keep a diary, but I can't find it anywhere. If I just had my diary back, I'm sure I could remember more. Will you help me find it? 
View Tyrande's audience with Anduin Wrynn.	Waning Hope	The kaldorei have been steadfast members of the Alliance since the end of the Third War. We have fought on distant shores and even on different worlds without protest. It is curious that in our moment of need, their resources are stretched too thin to lend so much as a single blade. Wrynn has already denied Tyrande aid. Witness it for yourself. 
Speak with Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth and travel to Vol'dun.	Voyage to the West	Reconnaissance reports that the Horde has made inroads into the desert of Vol'dun. We can't allow the Horde to continue to work there unchecked, so we're preparing an expedition to establish a beachhead. George, as one of our most accomplished soldiers I'd appreciate if you joined us. Your help will be essential for the success of our mission. Wrap up your affairs here in the harbor and report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth. We will set sail when you're ready. 
Quasi-Facet scan creatures in Mechagon	Toys Like Us	I must share the wonders of this place with all of Azeroth in a way that will entertain young and old alike. I will use the technology here to create a new line of toys unlike anything seen before! My Quasi-Faceted scanner can help construct perfect replicas of things here on the island. I just need a helpful individual such as yourself to scan a few things around this area. 
Kill 15 blood trolls and their allies within Torga's Rest.	The Savage Hunt	The blood trolls in Nazmir are monsters, pure and simple. No culture, no empathy, they only exist to destroy. Let's kill 'em and let whatever dark god they worship sort them out. 
Pay respects to King Rastakhan.	The King's Death	King Rastakhan is dead, the Zandalari fleet has been decimated, and we have lost valuable soldiers. The Dark Lady is on her way from Orgrimmar to assess the situation. We must figure out our next move before the Alliance strike again. I believe protocol now would be to pay respects to the fallen king. We will determine our next move afterwards. 
Kill 8 spiders in Zanchul.	Walls Have Ears	Yazma, mistress of spies. Bah! A traitor who is into creepy crawlies. She chose to side with Zul, and she uses de children of her loa, Shadra, to watch and track everything we do. We have to kill all de spiders we see, or dat traitor Yazma will know every move we make. 
Defend Varok Saurfang in Swamp of Sorrows.	A Warrior's Death	She gonna try an' take him in, and den no one ever gonna see Varok Saurfang again. Dis was never a rescue mission. Dis be about power, an' control, an' Sylvanas think she be holdin' all da cards. But she didn't count on us! Let's go! 
Drop Vile Bombardment on 100 pirates in Freehold.	Rodrigo's Revenge	The loud men are mean, but you seem nice! Want to have fun fun? The pretties love my special biscuits, but it makes them full full. Then they have to... go. You know? Let's prank the mean men! Fly fly on the pretties and make them go. 
Meet with Anduin Wrynn in Unity Square.	As the Dust Settles	We have achieved a great victory, George, though at a cost. King Wrynn is gathering the Alliance leadership in Unity Square to discuss matters. He has requested our presence as well. Go to Unity Square. I'll meet you there shortly. 
Stable your direhorn in the Beast Pen.	Naptime	Your not-so-little guy is looking a bit ragged after such an exciting day. I bet you both need a rest, hm? Come back later when you're a bit stronger. 
Find Kaza'jin's Reclaimed Bijous, Grimoire of the Other Side, and Venerated Remains.	Spirits' Belongings	You are no Zandalari, but your spirit burns with a passion I have not seen in many years. I am de wavebinder. It is through me dat de loa bless our ships. I will not see my home tainted by dese talking rocks. Gather my bijous, my grimoire, and some of our fallen I set aside for just such an occasion. De brutes think dey have won. Dey will answer to Bwonsamdi soon enough. 
Speak with Princess Talanji in the Port of Zandalar.	The Lost Spirit	It high time you an' I had a talk about ol' Vol'jin's missin' spirit. Dis goes beyond simple bargains and rights of passage. Spirits don' just go missin'. You gotta few friends dat are gonna help ya track Vol'jin's spirit down. Dem who was friends to him in life should have da strength to find him in death. And if not, Talanji gonna help ya. Go to Talanji's ship in da Port of Zandalar. It be dat banged up ship ya came in on. You gonna do a little seance. 
Meet with Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar.	For the Queen	<You chose not to side with the traitor Saurfang and his troll lackey. Now that you know where Saurfang is, and who is with him, you should report to Sylvanas to see if she has any further orders.> 
Bring the Urn of Vol'jin to Bwonsamdi in Nazmir.	You Owe Me a Spirit	Ya not leaving that here. Ol' Vol'jin not be dancin' in my house. I not be seein' his spirit for a long time. Its absence has broken de bonds dat held Zalazane in my control. So... I want you to lift dat heavy urn, and bring it to my necropolis. Vol'jin and I gonna have a face to face on my ground. 
Find someone in Warbeast Kraal who cares for young direhorn.	The Orphaned Hatchling	<The surviving hatchling bleats piteously as it gazes at its mother's corpse. It inspects you hopefully and seems to want to follow you. Perhaps you can find someone in Warbeast Kraal who can care for it?> 
With Hanzabu's Ritual Fetish, draw the ritual circle and sound the Drum of the Spirits to complete the ritual.	A Tribute for Death	Everything for de ritual is together. Now, it is time to begin. For dis to work, I must chant de words of old. It is an exhausting task, so I need you to take my mojo fetish and draw de ritual circle, then beat upon de drums. If all goes well, Bwonsamdi may invite us into de temple. If not, our souls are forfeit. Let's not make any mistakes. 
Acquire the powercore schematics from Bondo Bigblock.	Knock His Bot Off	I need to rebuild the main powercore. It's a 500S Mekronic so I'll need the operational schematics to get the work done. Only person I know who has a copy of that is Bondo Bigblock. We're going to need Bondo's help to finish this. Maybe if you ask him, he'll lend us his schematics. 
Meet with Zekhan in Swamp of Sorrows.	Grim Tidings	Ey mon, dat dark ranger, she be lyin' to ya! Saurfang knew dey'd be comin' for him. He sent me to watch da pass, see who his assassins be.

Use the attuned Scroll of the Missing to track and find the lost explorers.	Perfect Tidings	Your timing is most convenient, Mechanic. Our team had a check-in planned for this place, two days past. None have yet returned. I did not want to be brash and send word to the city too soon. However, I cannot leave this place empty, nor can I abandon young Koba. Take this scroll. See who, or what, you can find. Bring back those you can. 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Encrypted Black Market Radio	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a highly encrypted radio transmitter. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Return to Newhome in Nazjatar.	Back Out to Sea	Now that things're under control here, I'm sure they could use your help back in Nazjatar! Why don't ye head back out tae sea, err, or under the sea, tae lend a hand with the new folk there? 
Find out where the Crushblow Peons went.	Where Are the Workers?	Look at this axe, $p. There's still sweat on the hilt. The workers were here not too long ago. Let's see if Sasha can track their scent. 
Aid the Rustbolt resistance.	Rustbolt Rebellion	Aid the Rustbolt resistance. 
Defeat Lady Waycrest in Waycrest Manor.	Waycrest Manor: The Fallen Mother	This is all a lot to process...The Marshal... gone? My mother... the leader of the coven? It's just too much......but we have come too far to turn back now. It is clear that my mother and father, as I knew them, are gone. It is time we cleansed the taint from this land. We must take the inquisitors and find them in Waycrest Manor. We will end this, once and for all. 
Return to Katherine Proudmoore in Boralus.	Lost in Darkness	If people are being pulled somewhere else, it would explain why no one has ever returned. I also choose to believe it means Lady Jaina might be able to be saved as well. Go back to Lady Katherine with all speed! She will want to know of this development. 
	A Steamy Situation	 
Report to Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner in the Undercity.	The Warchief Awaits	George,There are important matters I would like to discuss with you, but discretion is of the utmost importance. Meet me in my chambers in the Undercity where I can assure our privacy has not been compromised. Ensure that you are not followed; Orgrimmar has become riddled with SI:7 spies. It would seem that that King Anduin and Mathias Shaw are desperate to know what our next move is. How admirable. 
Slay Harlan Sweete in the Freehold dungeon.	Freehold: A Pirate's End	Hey, uh, I don't usually ask for help with personal business, but I know when I'm outmatched. Someone's gotta take down Harlan. He's a maniac. The things I saw him do back in the day... that's why I left Freehold in the first place. H-hey don't think of it as a favor for me--even though it would be a HUGE favor--think of it as making the seas safer for everyone, or something noble like that.<Flynn leans in and whispers.>Plus there's a big fat bounty on his head! 
Inspect 5 Marked Goods in the Ashvane Foundry.	Suspicious Shipments	Normally I wouldn't tell you nothin'... but I'll spill it for Cyrus. Ashvane's onto somethin' big. They got guys workin' round the clock in there. Even brought in some muscle to keep everyone uh... ""motivated.""I don't know anything about what they're makin', but I know it ain't passin' through here to Boralus. If I were dumb enough to go snooping around in there, I'd look at the goods themselves. See if they got shipping labels. But I ain't that dumb, so you gotta do it. 
Look for Handler Bazkoji near Warbeast Kraal.	The Missing Handler	I just received word from Warbeast Kraal dat one of their handlers is missing. Dis is not usually a problem, but dey are expecting a large hatching dis year. Dey will need all de hands dey can get! Go on and see if you can find de handler, name of Bazo or something, and tell him to get back to de Kraal. 
Enable War Mode and slay 1 Horde Player within the world.	Do Your Part	The b-b-barber shop? I'm sorry, what? You want to know where the barber shop is? I'm sorry Human, do you know there is a W-A-R going on right now? Speaking of which, what have you done for the Alliance lately? Get out there and slay some Horde, or I'll shave your head myself. 
Return to the Chamber of Heart.	Do It the Azerite Way	Incredible! Ye stopped the wound from spreadin' before it could get out o' control! Nordrassil should be safe again, fer now. This is a good sign that we may just be able tae reverse all the damage done tae Azeroth. Let's get back tae the Chamber o' Heart, an' see if we can put any o' that azerite ye absorbed tae good use. 
	Sputtertube	 
Obtain a Drenched Mainspring.	Haywire Harvesters	See the golems down there? Farmers use their sharp claws to reap the harvest, but these are cutting timber... Why would they need them here when they have so many laborers on hand? I think the militia is using them to intimidate their own people! See if you can get ahold of an intact mainspring from one. I've helped repair a few back in Boralus. I should be able to figure out who is messing with their innards. 
Accept a gift from your companion.	Good Girl	I have learned so much by your side, I can't believe how many naga we've taken down! When you first arrived, I was skeptical that you'd make a difference. We've been down here, fighting, for so long. I had almost lost hope. But now, we see a way out of the darkness of the depths, finally! I took in a snapdragon pup when we formed Newhome, been training her ever since. I think... I think I'd like you to have her. She'll make a great mount... and loyal friend. 
Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore above the waterfall.	Upheaval	So many lives lost... And the attacks from the naga are relentless! I apologize, $p. This attitude is unbecoming of a king. We have no time to lose musing of our own plight. Let us meet with Jaina and descend from this perilous place into the unknown. 
Speak with a nearby bouncer.	Dueler's Guild	I figured a war-torn Human such as your self would benefit from training in the Dueler's Guild. Speak with a nearby bouncer to participate in the carnage. 
Join Falstad and Swiftwing on a bombing run over the Horde ships.	The Wildhammer Specialty	Well, if ye didn't find Blood Prince Dreven on yer ship, he must be hiding on the other one. I can take ye down to it, but the Horde knows we're here now. What do ye say we create some distractions to hold their attention while we hunt down Dreven? Me Wildhammers are itchin' tae let the hammers fly. Ye want to join us for the first round? 
	Make Loh Go	 
Find Kua'fon in Talanji's Rebuke and bribe him down with fish.	Mast Effect	Kua'fon was peering over de edge and managed to fall off de cliff again. Normally he gets back up here on his own, but it be taking too long this time. Best go down to de beach and find him. He is probably stuck up one of de ship masts out there. If he will not come down, you can try bribing him with more fish. 
Collect 60 Lost Coins.	Fun With Magnets	My last time in Tol Barad I had to leave in a big hurry, but I grabbed a few gadgets on the way out. This device is one of my favorites, so don't break it! It'll suck the treasure right out of the mud. It may make you tingle some, that's just the radiation. Find lost coins using the metal collector near the signs I've placed. 
Assist Brann Bronzebeard in Nazmir.	Foothold: Nazmir	The swamp of Nazmir is home to the notorious blood trolls. Captain Conrad has been dispatched to determine how we can use their hatred toward the Zandalari to our advantage. Reports from the jungle have proven disconcerting at best. - Mathias Shaw 
Destroy 5 Profane Totems with Kajosh's scroll of inferno.	Profanity Filter	I hate this place! I just want to go home, but I can't because that oaf, Shoak, is missing. Listen, Humant, I'll make it worth your while if you help me find that dunce. I've got a way to find Shoak, but of COURSE these stupid totems are blocking my magic! Why wouldn't they? Take this scroll and use its magic to burn these totems. I'm going to look around to see if that bonehead is just sleeping somewhere. 
Survive Jani's prank on Nesingwary. If you lose your saurid disguise, return to Jani for another.	Big Hunter Mon	In these valleys, the Mon be kepin' beasts alive only to serve as sport. For his entertainment. The lives of others not be so cheap. Even the smallest creature can cause a whole lotta trouble. The Mon gonna be learnin' to respect that. I think this be a good time to teach this Big Hunter Mon a lesson, don't you? Be you my faithful messenger? 
Take a key from a Hexwood Binder and free Master Ashton.	Saving Master Ashton	I believe I see Master Ashton in a cage. He must be freed! Those witches with the long masks appear to be in charge. I bet they would have the means to open his cage. I will remain here to protect Apprentice Webb and keep the area secure. 
Speak with Dread-Admiral Tattersail to sail to the Great Sea.	Journey to the Middle of Nowhere	Our tidesage, Thomas Zelling, claims to have found the wreckage of Marshal Valentine's ship. Took him long enough. Marshal Valentine's body is the final piece of our plan, and it lies within that shipwreck. When you're ready, let us depart for his resting place. 
Speak with 4 Proudmoore Guards in Unity Square.	Prepare for Trouble	With the evidence you've gathered, we can prove that the Ashvane Company was behind the attack. I would have preferred to do this in private, but I don't think we'll have the luxury. Look around - company men everywhere. Priscilla's got something up her sleeve...Let's get some backup before we go in there and cause a scene. 
Defeat Yazma in Atal'Dazar.	Atal'Dazar: Yazma the Fallen Priestess	Zul knows dat we cannot let de first king rise from his grave. Dazar would be more than a figure head for Zul's dream troll empire, he would be a force dat could rival de very loa. But I cannot just let Zul get away. I and mine will follow Zul, but I want you and yours to enter Atal'Dazar. Yazma is trying to buy time and keep de tombs sealed away. You will need to fight your way through to her and you will need some allies to do so. Slay her. 
Present the Glaive of Vol'jin with Talanji to the people of Zandalar.	The True Leader of Zandalar	Now, take me glaive and walk with Talanji. Let her present your victory to her people. Let da trolls know justice, and the strength of a leader. 
Retrieve Mgglurky's Mugglrgl from Bloodfin Village.	Mgglurky's Mugglrgl	My cook, Mgglurky, lost his mugglrgl and he's refusing to work until he gets it back. I've got a bar full of hungry murlocs and nothing to feed them until Mgglurky starts cooking. If Mgglurky doesn't find his mugglrgl soon, we're going to have a riot on our hands! I don't know about you, but I definitely don't want to be the main course tonight. There were some Bloodfins lurking around earlier. Search Bloodfin Village for the mugglrgl and bring it back to me once you find it. 
Defeat Azerite elementals and seal Azeroth's injuries at Nordrassil.	Healing Nordrassil	Azerite elementals are runnin' wild, driven mad by Azeroth's pain. They're menacin' the spirits o' nature that protect the World Tree. The roots o' Nordrassil run deep, nurtured by these sacred waters. For the sake o' Azeroth's world soul, the tree must be defended. Quiet the restless elementals and use yer Heart o' Azeroth tae mend the wounds ye find. We cannae let Hyjal become another gapin' scar like Silithus! 
Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.	Vinyl: Depths of Ulduar	<This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Depths of Ulduar.""You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.> 
Meet Brother Pike and Taelia at Mariner's Strand.	House Stormsong	I have little information to offer, I'm afraid. I've scarcely left Brennadam as of late. What they said is true. Our militia now enter town only to collect rations rather than guard traders or keep the quilboar at bay. They say they are under orders, but those orders would only come from my brothers at the Shrine. We take oaths to serve our people... it simply does not add up. Brother Addington is nearby at Mariner's Strand. Perhaps he knows more than I. 
Assist your hatchling in fighting 12 creatures.	Headbutting 101	Your beast is looking well fed. Good. Try and keep it dat way. Now, next you need to teach your little one to defend itself. Direhorns in de wild are prey for much larger creatures and de young are easy pickings for saurid and their like. Go out into de Savagelands and show your little one how to fend dem off. It's all in de horn, George. 
Slay Carentan.	The Long Con	Hello again my young friend! I have good news. Our mutual acquaintance Carentan -- the man who scammed us in Freehold -- has finally come out of hiding. I have been communicating with him in letters delivered by various middlemen and even completed a few proxy trades to earn his trust. In our last correspondence, he agreed to meet for an in-person trade. He thinks he is meeting with a Ms. Pixy Spindlespark, gnomish hairdresser with a weakness for poached furs. But he'll be meeting you instead. 
Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.	Vinyl: Mimiron's Brainstorm	<This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Mimiron's Brainstorm.""You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.> 
Destroy 4 Corrupted Energy.	Blood Purification	<You see a strange blood orb that emanates whispers of suffering and destruction. These must be the source of energy for whatever corruption Hezrel is hunting. They appear easy enough to destroy. You can see more of these orbs around the temple grounds. Perhaps destroying them will help to weaken the corruption in the area.> 
Inform Baine Bloodhoof of what has transpired.	The Price of Victory	Saurfang... I...<Lor'themar takes a moment to compose himself.>...Thrall will wish to honor Saurfang's sacrifice. And so shall the rest of us. Recall our forces. Let them know what has transpired. Tell them that the great warrior Varok Saurfang is dead and that the warchief has abandoned us. Speak to Baine when you arrive in Thunder Bluff. You will find him on the Elder Rise. I am certain he will want to pay his respects to Saurfang as well. Let us stand as a united Horde once more. 
Kill Bondo Bigblock.	The Final Act	Those of us with enough mechanization survived, but it didn't matter. Bondo Bigblock sold us out. In exchange for full mechanization, he built giant bots and attacked Rustbolt. He will continue to act against us, till those few of us left are dead. We must remove this threat immediately. 
Meet Kalecgos in the Twilight Highlands.	Investigating the Highlands	When I first sensed these essences, I did not anticipate the importance of the role they would play. It is only a matter of time before all of the dragonflights are brought into the fold. Though I have reached out to the other Aspects, I have yet to hear from Alexstrasza. It is odd that she would be silent while these powers manifest. She was last seen in the Vermillion Redoubt in Twilight Highlands. I fear she may be in trouble. We must hurry. 
	Whiplash	 
Connect power lines from Bondo's Yard to the Quickcharge laboratory.	More Power	Welcome back, dear test subject. My dear sister has kindly asked me to administer today's experiment, which falls below our typical standards of legality...You may, as always, choose not to participate and we will acquire sufficient replacement test subjects. Our new project requires more energy than our generator can manage. We must supercharge it with a jolt of power from the outside. Bondo's Yard has the best power line in Mechagon, so we shall siphon what we need from those rapscallions. 
Seal the Azerite Fissures in The Dragon's Spine.	Calming the Spine	It is plain that the situation here is dire. The power of the black dragonflight echoes around us, and the earth is reeling in response. I have heard tales of ruptures like these on Kul Tiras and Zandalar. The elementals have been driven into a frenzy, and they bar our way from seeking the essence. If we are to preserve the tenuous balance of the elements here, the wounds must be mended, George. 
Take the Dagger to the Makeshift Altar.	Orders from Azshara	<Kojo studies the medallion and grimaces.>Ugh... naga. This medallion is inscribed with orders. Looks like naga have been commanded to invade our shores and seize artifacts of great power. You know, I recently came upon one such object. See that dagger over there? Nasty thing. Gives me the willies. I swear I hear it whispering to me. I found it on an island in Stormsong Valley, on a makeshift altar. Maybe if you take it there, you'll get an idea of how the naga intended to use it. 
Recruit tortollans to your cause on the way to Gloom Hollow.	To Gloom Hollow	There's only one safe area in Nazmir that this Rokhan and your other Horde friends could be in. Gloom Hollow. Lucky for you, it's also close to Krag'wa's den. We used Gloom Hollow as a last stop on our pilgrimage. Make your way to Gloom Hollow along the path I've marked on your map, and tell any tortollans along the way to meet us there. They'll be interested in seeing the end of this story. We'll make our way there and grab anyone else we find. 
Explore the nearby town with Tinkmaster Overspark.	Princely Visit	This is it! The fabled Mechagon! The greatest discovery of our age, and you're here to witness me accomplish it!<Tinkmaster Overspark puffs out his chest, brushes off his robes, and smiles confidently.>I am ready to address the Mechagon people. You may accompany me. 
Search the Banshee's Wail for signs of Blood Prince Dreven.	Behind Enemy Boats	This is where our information ends, $p. Blood Prince Dreven is lurking in one of those Forsaken boats, but we don't know which boat or which section of that boat he's in. We'll split up and hit the boats simultaneously, so the Horde has less time to react. If Dreven isn't on the boat you scout, abandon it and join me on the other one. If he's not on my boat, I'll do the same. We'll take down Dreven together. Don't get distracted. Our resources are limited. Dreven is our only target today. 
Report to Jaina Proudmoore near Proudmoore Keep in Boralus.	The Gathering Storm	While I deal with the naga incursions, Lady Proudmoore is going to take on handling the Horde in Stormsong Valley and figuring out what happened to our spies there. You'll find her near Proudmoore Keep. 
Speak to Merithra to travel deeper into the Emerald Dream.	We Must Go Deeper	These shards can only do so much in their current state. They are broken and scattered... not unlike my kin. We must bring them together. Let us go deeper into the Emerald Dream. I know of a place where we can reforge the shards into a dragonscale. With it, you can empower the Heart of Azeroth with the essence of my dragonflight. We must go to the ancient heart of the Dream, where my mother once rested. Speak with me when you are ready to delve deeper. 
Deliver the item to Marvelous Martini.	Paint Vial: Lemonade Steel	<Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.> 
Slay the Crimson Cutthroats near Falconhurst.	WANTED: The Crimson Cutthroats	For numerous and sinister crimes against the Lord Admiral: smuggling, forgery, sailing under false colors, looting, poaching, brigandage, sacking, pillaging, vandalism, impersonating Kul Tiran Naval officers, arson, kidnapping, torture, piracy, perjury, theft and ransacking multiple mead shipments. A reward is placed on the heads of The Crimson Cutthroats to be paid in full upon proof of their demise. 
Set up the calling conch and make the rounds.	Settling In	Whatever Azshara is up to, this *ahem* great new landscape we have found ourself in is terribly inconvenient. Too many getting too close to our home. We have moved most of the refugees deeper into the cave. Could you ask Telur to move our calling conch inside? Grab some of Slen's Elixir and check in with Vim. Once it is set up, test it out! I'm off to do a progress check! 
Enter the vault.	Looking Inside	This vault screams of ancient gnomish tech! I believe this could be the key that leads us to King Mechagon! I can't risk putting myself in danger though, so you will lead the way into the vault. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's see what's inside! 
Deliver the item to Marvelous Martini.	Paint Vial: Overload Orange	<Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.> 
Meet with the Rajani at the Silent Sanctuary.	Time-Lost Warriors	According to the scouting report ye found, the Rajani are holed up in the Silent Sanctuary, overlooking Mistfall Village. They are described in the report as seclusive and dangerous, so we'd had best take caution when approaching them. I'll meet ye there. 
Mount a Proudmoore Charger and chase Priscilla Ashvane.	Hot Pursuit	Priscilla's escaping on horseback! Grab one of our chargers and chase her down! 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	Operation: Water Wise	Rexxar has reported back with news of a new... ally. Report to the Banshee's Wail for your briefing. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Tiny Madness	 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Holographic Digitalization Relay	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be some form of holographic teleporter. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
20 Pristine Hound Bolts, 4 Steel Tibia XS, and 2 Machined Heel Nut.	Adapt, Improve, Overcome!	Izira Gearsworn is still alive, she is Rustbolt's strongest fighter, but her legs are broken. If we're going to survive I need parts to repair and upgrade her. There are machines all over with parts we can salvage. With some perseverance we should be able to fix Izira's legs. Help me obtain the following parts. 
Find the scouts. If you lose Neri, return to the conch to call her.	Scouting the Pens	Some of our scouts have not returned. They have been keeping an eye on the Zanj'ir Slave Pens. The naga there take our people. They break their minds. Our scouts watch them, and when there is a window, they rescue them. Something is going on. We need to get them home! 
	Fathom Ray Feast	 
Collect resources from around Nazjatar.	Requisition: We Need It All	We are dangerously low on all of our supplies. Please, you must go out and collect as much as you can. Please return with any resources you find to the quartermaster! 
Recover 3 crates of Stolen Supplies.	Trinkets and Baubles	Beneath the tides, these terrors do not see fit to stay within their warrens. They have emerged in the night, stealing away to the villages and indulging in their avarice. They will use the provisions against us, to serve in their rituals. Rituals of summoning and communion with powers too terrible to comprehend. The populace is no concern of mine anymore, but I would not see these briny thieves to have their way. Relieve them of their plunder, and let them learn a bitter lesson. 
Slay Nol'ixwan and Ten'gor	WANTED: Ten'gor and Nol'ixwan	To any hunters worthy of the challenge: Find and defeat the dueling giant direhorn and devilsaur, named Nol'ixwan and Ten'gor. Their never-ending battle has disrupted travel throughout Zuldazar. Glory for any that succeed! 
Assign new roles to Micah Broadhoof, Boss Mida, and Nomi.	Playing to Their Strengths	Iltheux isn't properly utilizing the help he's been given. Let's fix that. Assign new roles to the workers, ones more suited to their strengths. If you need suggestions, I'm happy to help. 
Bring the key to Lorewalker Cho in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.	Ancient Crypt Key	<A magical device found on the mogu island invaders, it contains no more power. You are aware of similar devices that were used to activate ancient titan machinery in the mogu vaults of Pandaria. This particular one teems with a foreboding presence. The Lorewalkers may know more about this device.> 
Kill Nebbik Megafuel, collect Azerite bombs, and bring them to Jaina on top of the seagate.	Stopping the Sappers	The ice should keep the Horde out while we handle the sapper teams gathered on the beach. I'm going to keep those Horde galleons busy. I need you to handle whoever is in charge and bring all the Azerite bombs you find back to me. Then we'll handle disposing of their weapons. 
Choose a weapon for Nisha.	Armed and Ready	You must be special if the sethrak didn't kill you right away. Either that, or you'd fetch a good price at the slave market. Don't worry though. We're getting out of here. I have a wagon at the entrance, but no weapon to fight with. Luckily, it seems the sethrak have plenty. 
Slay 15 Dockside Ruffians.	Shakedown	Where are de guards? Princess Talanji has convinced King Rastakhan to permit outsiders in our port. For de first time in centuries, we have allowed non-trolls to set foot on our shores and peddle their wares. And now trolls of lesser tribes seem to think dey can take advantage of these merchants? I will not allow dis sort of behavior. While I investigate why de merchants are not protected, I want you to work your way through de bazaar and slay any thugs you find. Send dem a message. 
Recover 75 Family Jewels	The Family Jewels	Darn pirates stole my jewels... err, I mean my sister's... uh, mom's jewelry. Yeah, that's the story! Point is, they stole it, and it's all out there strewn around in the mud, and treasure chests. Maybe on a few of the robots and murlocs. My mom's not greedy, she just wants a few of the necklaces with gold and lots of diamonds. I'd pay ya for those. 
Return to Boralus with Taelia.	Bearers of Bad News	We must report this attack to Lord Admiral Katherine Proudmoore and prove to her that Lady Ashvane is behind it. It won't be easy... Lady Ashvane and Katherine Proudmoore have been close friends for years. Quickly, let us make for Boralus! 
	Kelpstone	 
Meet Xal'atath at the Precipice of Oblivion.	Twist the Knife	The relics are ours... as it was meant to be. There is but one more step needed for the great truths to be revealed. The naga sought to summon their storm from a place that echoes with ancient power. Though this site has had countless names over the ages, you mortals know it as the Precipice of Oblivion. I will go on ahead and begin preparations. Join me there. 
Collected a Ritual Knife, Ritual Lantern and Ritual Robes from the Fallen Hullwardens and Abyssal Prophets in Tempest's Edge.	Ritual Effects	I will need some assistance in conducting the ritual to allow us to gain passage to Fate's End. To help me with that, you will require the proper items and attire. Normally I have free access to these things, but the recent upheaval has blocked myself and many of my brothers and sisters from obtaining them easily. However, the fallen tidesages across the span have all you will need. Collect a ritual knife, lantern and robes from the fallen and these so-called prophets. 
	Hungry Hungry Hydras	 
Destroy 12 Heartsbane objects in Arom's Stand.	Implements of Ill Intent	<It looks like some careless witch made a poor attempt to hide this grimoire from sight. No good could come of leaving the possessions of the coven for a hapless villager to find. It would probably be a good idea to destroy any trappings of the coven that you find in Arom's Stand.> 
Meet Inquisitor Cleardawn in the Crimson Forest.	Into the Crimsonwood	Master Ashton has been taken into the forest. He isn't the only one. Mayor Royston's headcount came up short. It seems our next steps are clear. We must go into the woods and save Master Ashton. Marten and I will sneak into the forest and meet you near some ruins further in. 
Complete the mission ""Spy on Warfang Hold""	Spy Versus Spy	Naga attacks are on the rise, but that isn't all we have to deal with. We've received word of increased Horde activity near Warfang Hold in Stormsong Valley. Send some of our operatives to investigate what they are doing. 
Examine 6 Corlain Citizen's Journals in Upper Corlain.	The Fall of Corlain	<This discarded journal looks like it belonged to one of the residents of upper Corlain. Within it details some early signs of the Heartsbane's appearance in Corlain. If you can find more writings like this, you might be able to piece together the events that led to Corlain's current state.> 
Mount Cooper and practice your Kul Tiran riding skills.	Beginner Equitation	You may know how to ride already, but you don't know how to ride like a Kul Tiran! We'll let you borrow a horse for the festivities. Take one of our lesson masters, Cooper. He's trained many a beginner in his day! Mount up, get in the ring, and show us what you've got! I'm sure you'll be a quick learner! 
Speak with Wardruid Loti in the Zocalo.	The Zanchuli Council	You there, Speaker of de Horde. My spies have told me of dark heresies being practiced in our sacred temple of Zanchul. De king sent Loti and Raal to deal with de situation, but those two bickering council members are soft on their own followers. We need someone more... ruthlessly neutral. Go meet Wardruid Loti down at de Zocalo and she can tell you de rest. 
Kill Chief Engineer Grizz.	Grizzled	I saw a particularly ugly and quite agitated goblin barking orders at the rest of the miners. I'm willing to bet he's crucial to their entire operation. If you can get into the mine and eliminate him, hopefully it will throw things into disarray. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	This Little Piggy Has Sharp Tusks	 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Blue Spraybot	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a small robot capable of showering an area in colored paint. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Slay the 3 Corrupted Guardians of Zanchul.	Competitive Devotion	Okay, I know dis situation is serious, but she gave you de power of her loa? Sounds to me like Loti is more big on recruiting than on dealing with dis blood troll threat. Inside de temple behind me are three guardians. When I walked in dere, de things tried to kill me. Me! Someone has corrupted our own guardians. Here, I will lend you de voice of my own loa, Pa'ku, de pterrordax. Use it to crush dis corruption. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Add More to the Collection	 
	Supplies Needed: Tiragarde Perch	 
Investigate the disturbance.	Getting the Message	Da loa be powerful, but we be needin' soldiers if we gonna have a chance of stopping dem blood trolls from building dat giant of theirs. If we not be able ta destroy dat thing before it be finished, den Zuldazar and all of our people gonna be dead! We need da help of da Horde! Word of da situation already be sent to da warchief. As soon as we be hearin' her reply, we can mov-- Wait... what be dat noise? 
Use Ticker's Rocket Launcher to slay 4 Vilescale Behemoths.	Revenge: Served Hot	Look, the boss might be keeping a level head here, but we should show these naga what happens when you mess with the Gob Squad. Don't you agree? The naga are sending their behemoths to destroy what's left of our ship. Why don't you take my rocket launcher and make an example out of them. That'll send the message loud and clear! 
Travel to Fate's End and search for signs of Jaina.	Fate's End	Fate's End is a place in turmoil. The seas froth, the air cracks with thunder. We tried to settle there once, but each settlement disappeared into the mists, every soul never to be seen again. The island did not want inhabitants. Now we send our most vile exiles there. They never return and no one knows why. Should we find and recover Jaina, she will be the first. I hope we are not too late. 
Collect Priscilla's Orders from Forgemaster Farthing and Taskmaster Williams.	Message from the Management	<This letter from Priscilla Ashvane to her employees appears to be posted all over the foundry. It sounds like Cagney's information was accurate, Ashvane is working their people around the clock. Priscilla mentions a Forgemaster Farthing and a Taskmaster Williams. They may have more information about her plans.> 
Witness the Horde gathering.	A Gathering of Foes	Before I was distracted, I was able to find out more about this Horde gathering. Sylvanas has summoned the leaders of the Horde and its allies. For what purpose, I cannot say. We aren't in a position to strike her down--she is too well-protected. But perhaps we can learn something that will prove useful in the ongoing war. Keep your head low and take a look. I'll keep an eye out for more guards. 
Confront Ma'haat the Indomitable in the Dragon's Spine.	Dominating the Indomitable	With the wounds healed, I can clearly sense the dragon essence. Unfortunately, it seems to emanate from the earthen giant before us. I will address the creature. Let us hope it listens to reason... but be prepared for anything. When Deathwing shattered the World Pillar in Deepholm, he earned the ire of the Stonemother and her forces. I fear this being may blame me for my father's crimes. 
	Junkyard Treasures	Everyone here needs to work hard to find resources for our cause. Locate and open ten mechanized chests on the island. 
Gather 5 Evermoss Clumps.	Numbing the Pain	The medics here are doing their best, but they've suffered heavy casualties and are strapped for healing supplies. With a few clumps of evermoss I could mix a painkilling tincture to ease the suffering of the injured. Can you forage some from the nearby trees? I'll help get Flynn stabilized. The last thing these people need is another wounded man howling in pain. 
Collect 15 Sandstinger Venom Glands.	Restorative Venom	Meerah here found your friend in the dunes. The lightning strike nearly killed her. It might still, without treatment. The wasps within the grove have a painful sting, but their venom also has restorative properties. I can extract what I need from their glands. With an ample amount of venom, we should be able to soothe your friend's wounds. 
Use the Lightspawn's light to dispel nearby necrotic energy.	Freeing the Light	Ah... you are not in league with the ogres. Please, you must aid me. I have been bound against my will by dark magic. I ask only that you free me. Take a piece of my light. Use it to dispel the necrotic energies that are keeping me captive. 
Build the Hundred-Fathom lure.	Build A Bigger Fish Trap	With those minnows and some spare parts, you should be able to build a Hundred-Fathom Lure. Visit Pascal-K1N6 in Rustbolt and build one. Then come back here, and we'll catch a huge fish! 
Destroy 8 Jambani stockpiles.	Preparing for the Fall	<A large quantity of supplies are scattered throughout the temple grounds, much of it under heavy guard. The Jambani appear to be preparing for a siege or another significant event. Zul would likely think it wise to stymie their efforts.> 
	Soul Goliath	 
Take Bloodfire Ravine from the Blood Trolls.	The Battle of Bloodfire Ravine	It is time to strike out and end de blood troll threat once and for all! We travel back to Bloodfire Ravine, and dis time it is de blood trolls who will be sent running. Mount up, and together we will show dem we are a force to be reckoned with! 
Retrieve 8 Horde Explosives and use them against the Demolishers.	Bombs, Away	By the sea's foamy beard, what a blast! They've brought goblins, and if there's one thing I know about goblins it's that they like to blow things up. I saw a few of them carrying large bombs, and I presume that they are going to blow up the town. I would like to keep the town, so how about you head out there and steal as many of those explosives as you can find? After that, let's blow up their demolishers and stop this infernal bombardment! 
Speak with MOTHER to establish the Tenebrous Gateway in the Chamber of Heart.	Opening the Gateway	The fabric of reality is torn. But there's no need for me to tell you that, George. You've seen it firsthand. It's only a matter of time before these realities become one, veiled in eternal darkness. Instead of hiding, perhaps it's time we embraced the darkness. With the help of our titan friend here we may be able to thread the needle of this reality through the fabric of another, creating a bridge of sorts. After all, the key to understanding an enemy's weakness is to understand their intentions. 
Tell Talanji about your experience with Bwonsamdi and Hir'eek.	Catching Up	Good to see you in one piece, George. Nazmir is a place of nightmares, but you seem to be surviving. Rokhan and I convinced your Horde dat we need more support. He is getting ready to meet with reinforcements. We still need to get de loa's aid. What happened with Bwonsamdi and Hir'eek? 
Reveal Lady Ashvane's treason to Katherine Proudmoore.	Make Our Case	Katherine has trusted Priscilla Ashvane as an advisor and a close friend for many years, even before they both lost their husbands at Theramore. She's heard the rumors about Ashvane, just like anyone. Whether by fear or loyalty, she's chosen to ignore them. It's time to finally open her eyes. 
Bargain with Gonk.	Gonk, Lord of the Pack	You can find Gonk in his lair west of here, in de Garden of the Loa. You should be able to see his totems. Run near dem to improve your speed. I will continue to purge de heretics from dis temple. Mind your manners around de loa, or he may rip your throat out. 
Meet Zul the Prophet in Tal'gurub.	Tal'gurub	My prophet is a loyal servant, but he has his own ideas of how things must be. I am sending him to Tal'gurub to deal with a mess of his own making. One of his pupils, a witch doctor by de name of Vol'jamba, has taken de Gurubashi enclave as his own and has ousted my guards. Meet Zul at Tal'gurub and ensure dis nuisance is dealt with. Do not let him get... distracted. 
Defeat the Alliance at the Battle for Darkshore.	Heroic Warfront: The Battle for Darkshore	Darkshore belongs to the Horde! We must hold that ground to maintain our dominance over Kalimdor. Prepare yourselves. Battle awaits! 
Make the necessary preparations at the Zoram'gar Outpost.	Zoram'gar Outpost	Saurfang shall establish our troops here, now that Astranaar is ours. I shall continue my hunt for the only creature that can stop our march to victory: Malfurion Stormrage. Our next order of business will be to establish a foothold at the base of Darkshore. Commander Grimfang of the Zoram'gar Outpost should be able to accommodate an incoming army. Inform him of our arrival and ensure the necessary preparations are made. 
Take the Medallion to Collector Kojo.	The Azsharan Medallion	<On the naga's body you find an ornate metal disc. The writing on its surface resembles elven script, but you cannot decipher it. You suspect the words are written in the Nazja tongue. Perhaps someone with a knowledge of naga artifacts could translate the text.> 
	Solar Collector	 
Witness Kiro's declaration to join the Horde.	A Declaration of Intent	Our caravan is ready to explore the world beyond the sands, but Nisha's blade can't be our only defense against the dangers we know await us. This is why we've come. To declare our intent to join the Horde. 
Use the Ultra-Safe Electrified Alpaca Lasso to obtain a Lost Alpaca, then bring it back to Explosioneer Zoidfuse.	They Have Alpacas Here	Did you see? Did you see them? The floofy alpacas?!I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A... I mean, ahh, ahem! I would like to acquire an alpaca. To study. For scientific reasons. Nothing to do with floofiness at all. Here, this should help you wrangle one back here. 
Speak with Zolani, Blade of the King.	Evidence of Evil	Jakra'zet refused to patrol dis area. Yazma's spies did not warn us of de evil lurking beneath our city. And Zul did not foresee blood magics festering under our noses. These are serious allegations, and de evidence is in your hands. Present dem to Zolani, Blade of the King. She will know best their meaning and how best to present dem to de king. 
Collect the Dockmaster's Records.	Papers, Please	All this legwork will be for nothing if we can't show Katherine hard proof linking the Ashvane Company to the freebooters here in Freehold. Ashvane might have been careful to encrypt their books, but I doubt the dockmaster here has any reason to be so secretive. Check his office and find us something--anything--that connects him to Ashvane. 
Escort Gallywix and Eitrigg on Gallywix's War Trike. If you become separated from Gallywix and Eitrigg, you can find them at Anyport.	Profit and Reconnaissance	This was supposed to be a covert operation. Unfortunately, our Trade Prince insisted on coming along... with the loudest, most conspicuous vehicle the Horde has ever conceived. At least you're here with me, George. Let's get going, then. We know next to nothing about the Drustvar territory. It's time to do some recon. 
	Picturesque Norwington Estate	 
Accept a gift from your companion.	Wild Tame	In our time together, I have learned much. Both about my own abilities, and about your people. You are selfless in the face of challenge, much like our own. I consider us kin. For some time, I have been training a snapdragon I found as a pup. He is a worthy mount, and I have been waiting for a worthy hunter to ride him. I believe I have found that hunter. Here, he is yours. 
Rescue the Rustbolt Resistance members.	Rescuing the Resistance	King Mechagon is ruthlessly efficient. He only expends resources to kidnap those he deems worthy. The rest, he... discards.<Prince Erazmin grimaces.>We will deal with my father, King Mechagon, another day. This information is more immediately relevant in that my father's predictability means our top scientists, engineers, and tinkerers should all be trapped, alive, somewhere in this depot. We will find them, and break them out. 
Kill 10 Zandalari soldiers on board the Gral's Call.	Leave None Alive	Our initial assault was a success. The Dark Iron dwarves are holding the line. Now it's our turn. You and I must cleave a path through these Zandalari and eliminate them. Our forces will handle any that remain. Our goal is to weaken their forces and find two important targets: the ship's captain and its advisor. Let's go, George. If we fail here, all of our efforts will be thwarted. 
Return to Merithra in the Chamber of Heart with the Dreamglow Dragonscale.	The Long Awake	There is nothing more you can do for us here, champion. You have the power you sought, and the Emerald Dream is fighting back against the Void. Bring this dragonscale back to Magni and the others. I will meet you in the Chamber of Heart to help infuse it into the Heart of Azeroth. As for my flight, our long vigil must continue... or we will be lost to the Void. 
Start the mission ""Casting the Bait"" then report to Nathanos Blightcaller aboard the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	Under False Colors	If we wish to stay the executioner's axe, we'll need to throw Sylvanas off of our scent. You'll need to have your men take the ship to Chandlery Wharf, where they can disguise it as a pirate's bounty. Your task will be to ensure that Sylvanas' forces find the ship there. You must report to Nathanos that you spotted a stolen Forsaken vessel in that area. You have no connection to Derek Proudmoore, so it should raise no suspicions. 
Stop 5 Street Scamps from stealing.	The Scamps	You there! You have legs and a need for money? I wish to hire you. Confounded, despicable, parentless children have been stealing my scrolls again. Those scrolls are dangerous in the wrong hands. What is worse, I believe these junior vagabonds to be organized. Find these street scamps and relieve them of their bounty, and I shall pay you for it. 
Walk with Garona Halforcen belowdecks on the Banshee's Wail.	Mission from the Warchief	Lady Sylvanas issued orders for Garona Halforcen to take on a task of great import. She will orchestrate missions from the Banshee's Wail, and is to assemble a strong force to execute on our plans. This effort will be vital to our war against the Alliance, and your assistance will certainly be necessary. 
Slay Headhunter Jo.	Headhunter Jo	He said he's hunting you. I'm not the prey, I'm the bait! Behind ye! 
Meet with Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus Harbor.	Operation: Gryphon's Claw	SI:7 has procured some interesting intel. I request your presence on the Wind's Redemption immediately to help decide our next course of action. 
Collect 45 Azerite Dust and Walters' Chemistry Kit.	Pinch of Azerite	I don't have time for idle chit chat! If you haven't noticed, rocks are running around doing who knows what?!How about you help out and retrieve my chemistry kit. While you're out, smash some of those creatures and collect their dust. Prim will need both of those for the next step of the plan. Maybe we can figure out what has animated the Azerite. 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Utility Mechanoclaw	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a feisty robotic hand. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
	Azerite Madness	 
Speak with Dennis Grimtale at Talanji's Rebuke.	Keep Them On Task	Princess Talanji's actions have thrown off our pursuers. Her loa is powerful indeed. We need to be certain if there were survivors, they do not gain a foothold on Zandalar. I am concerned that our Forsaken compatriots might get... overzealous. Please keep an eye on them, and remind them of what is honorable. 
Meet King Rastakhan.	Rastakhan	You stand before General Jakra'zet, lord of de armies of Zandalar, enforcer of her seas and bringer of war. And I do not like you. It took years to earn my place here after your Horde laid waste to my people. You will not undo what I have built. I will see you kneel before King Rastakhan. I will watch you beg as he lets me take your head for a trophy. I will fling your corpse into de wastes of Vol'dun. Her ""Highness"" may object... but she is not queen yet. Come. Let us fly to your fate. 
Use the blowgun to weaken 5 Bloodhunter trolls.	A Poisonous Touch	You... I saw you speak with Zentimo. Please, I don't have much time left...These trolls, they came for our blood. I was already nearly bled dry before this one succumbed to my poison. Search it's body, the blowgun and darts should still be there. Dip the darts into my blood and use them to weaken as many of their number as you can. I will not let my death be in vain! If these trolls want our blood so badly, then they shall have it! 
Help Lorewalker Cho discover the origin of the Mysterious Mogu Sigil at the Seat of Knowledge.	Clans of the Mogu	You say a mogu asked for your help? This is quite uncharacteristic. I'd be happy to help you uncover the origins of this sigil. To be honest, the prospect of a mogu clan that isn't openly hostile interests me greatly. Just think of the possibilities! Let's get down to business. We'll need to consult the volumes on the various mogu clans in the vale to narrow it down. 
Open the Eastern, Southern, and Western Gates in Upper Corlain.	To the Other Side	It looks like the coven is using Corlain as a base of operations. There's no way we'll be able to cut through this many of them without the rest of the Inquisitors. They must still be stuck behind the wall. Mechanic, there are three smaller footmen gates along the walls into Corlain. See if you can get them open so our allies can make their way through. 
Slay Blood Troll forces.	The New Frontline	Kill anything ya see dat not a Zandalari! 
Defend Vassandra Stormclaw as she summons Goldrinn.	Waking a Dreamer	This should be all I need to call upon the Ancient. Some unwanted visitors may answer the call first. Protect me as I perform the ritual! 
Search Vol'dun for Horde activity.	Comb the Desert	It's time to mobilize, then. I'll stick with you, George. Keep an eye out for Horde activity. 
Meet Bladeguard Sonji at Sandscar Breach.	Sandscar Breach	I heard some mutterings about sand and snakes. The plea comes from a tiny village on the very fringes of Zuldazar- hardly more than a few farms. Dol-something I think it was called. Don't know what they be calling it now. Go see what the fuss is about. Bladeguard Sonji was sent ahead some time ago. She should be able to get you up to speed on that... situation. 
Speak with Baine Bloodhoof in Dazar'alor.	Zanchuli Disbanded	I would like to say we are doing well, but we are not. De Zanchuli Council is broken. Raal and I are all dat remain who are still loyal to King Rastakhan. You best bring news to your Horde and tell dem what transpired here. Raal and I will rally what support we can and head for de Zocalo. And hero, thank you for saving my life and my loa. 
Speak with Spiritwalker Ussoh at Fargaze Mesa in Camp Narache.	The Spiritwalkers	As you know, the spiritwalkers commune with our ancestors and maintain balance within the spirit realm. It is a sacred duty that links our present to our past. But lately the spiritwalkers have been troubled by visions of chaos and turmoil. Of a rising darkness. They tell me that the spirits have whispered your name. We are unsure why, but Spiritwalker Ussoh means to find out. Seek Ussoh on Fargaze Mesa to the south. Good luck, George. I believe you may need it. 
Weaken the Norwington Estate defenders.	Cleaning Out the Estate	We must keep moving forward. Our goal is to weaken the Alliance, destroy their weapons, and steal their Azerite. The three of us will carve a path of destruction through our enemies. Let us go! 
Speak with Merithra to enter the Emerald Dreamway.	Enter the Dreamway	We have little time, so I will be brief. The Emerald Dream is under attack. The shadows of the Void are on the rise, and not even the Dream is beyond their reach. Many of my kin have already been slain, and still more are at risk. We must enter the Dreamway and save what remains of my dragonflight before it is too late. 
Meet with Dark Ranger Lyana in Elwynn Forest.	A Way Out	My spies report that our High Overlord did not leave the way he entered, nor any other way we know of. No signs of him were seen at any of the known exits from the Stockades or the sewers. He simply was in his cell one moment, and gone the next. Begin your investigation around the city of Stormwind. There must be another way out that we do not know of. Dark Ranger Lyana will meet you there. Her tracking skills are second to none. Do not fail me, my champion. 
Collect 3 Azerite Cutlasses and 2 Horns of Azerite Powder from Irontide Cutthroats and Irontide Trickshots.	The Irontide Crew	You see those salty looking guys in red? That's the Irontide crew. They're the worst of the worst. Cutthroats and brigands, to a man. Irontide wouldn't be guarding the docks if they didn't stand to gain something...Lighten their pockets. See what kinda hardware they've got. 
Find out what troubles Commander Dresh, Bladeguard Sonji, and First Arcanist Thalyssra.	New Allies, New Problems	Baine certainly has his hands full. Taking on new allies means taking on new problems. Let us find out what troubles those within the Horde and see what we can do to help. Perhaps when Baine isn't so overwhelmed, he'll be able see our true value. 
Slay 10 Zalamar Zealots in The Fall.	Zealots of Zalamar	We're surrounded by the enemy, George, and it's got me blood ragin'!I'm fit as a fi... instrument... and ready to help get us outta this forsaken cavern. Let's show 'em the end o' their miserable lives, eh? 
Use the Zandalar Campaign Map to choose a foothold.	The Ongoing Campaign	We have made excellent progress on Zandalar, George, but we must continue to expand our influence. It is time for us to cross the sea once again to exert pressure on enemy lands, lest they fall fully into Horde hands. Which location shall we secure next? 
Follow the residue trail to locate the Azerite Weapons Cache.	Let the Residue Lead You	I've fashioned a device that will emit bioluminescent light when toggled on, allowing you to see any Azerite residue that lingers. It should give you a clear trail to the weapons cache. Good luck, George. 
	Enemies at the Gate	 
Find Vorrik and free him from his captors.	A Powerful Prisoner	It appears the Faithless broke through our defenses while I was away. They must be after Vorrik's key. It's the only reason they would have taken him alive. Please, George. You must secure our leader's safe return. 
Meet King Phaoris in Ramkahen.	To Ramkahen	It looks like we're gonna have tae wait a spell while MOTHER figures out what tae do with the forge. In the meantime we'll want tae try to make sure nobody tries tae do any more damage here. Ye should check in on the tol'vir in Ramkahen. I know ye've helped them in the past, so they might be able tae help us keep the forge out o' the wrong hands. 
Destroy 4 Mole Machines.	None Shall Escape	De Alliance are using de Dark Iron's mole machines to transport troops in and out of Zalamar. We need dose machines destroyed. We are going to establish Zalamar as our forward base to attack de Alliance's main fleet. Take out dem machines, den find Rokhan within Zalamar. He be tracking down where de Alliance general be hidin'. 
Slay Urda Direflame and then place a telemancy beacon near the Eye of Xibala.	Grand Theft Telemancy	They must not keep the Eye, George. Fortunately I am more than an archaeologist. I am a telemancer. Chief Telemancer Oculeth himself trained the woman who trained my master. I can retrieve the relic with these arts. All you need to do is place a telemancy beacon near the Eye. I can then retrieve both it AND you safely back to camp. The Alliance will find themselves empty-handed. While you're at it, do deliver my ""thanks"" to the individual responsible for snatching the Eye out from under us. 
Meet Shandris Feathermoon outside of Zo'bal Ruins.	Meeting of the Minds	We're in luck. The missive details a meeting in Zo'bal Ruins between Talanji, Rokhan, Areiel, and Blood Prince Dreven. This is our chance to gain more intel on Dreven and his next move. He killed our soldiers in Vol'dun, it's time for him to pay. Meet me outside of Zo'bal Ruins. We're going to sneak into the ruins, listen to their plans, and decide what to do next. 
Protect Archaeologist Firebreaker.	Backup While I Pack Up	I came in here tae try an' reclaim as many relics as possible. Sneakin' in was easy, but I'm worried about things noticin' me while I pack up. Mind watching me back while I get the relics stored in a safe place in my bag? 
Visit Derek Proudmoore and Calia Menethil.	...And Following Seas	My brother Derek died in the Second War, only to be raised against his will by the Banshee Queen. If not for Baine Bloodhoof's courageous act of defiance, Derek would have been turned into a weapon against my family. He's lived in torment since his awakening. I feared he would be lost to us, but he has received help from an old friend of mine who has also been recently raised--Calia Menethil. She has guided him back from the brink of despair. I am on my way to pay them a visit. Care to join me? 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Rustbolt Requisitions	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a military-grade supply cache with the Rustbolt Resistance insignia on it. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Speak with Nisha.	Allies in Anarchy	Even after all these years, I can feel the ancient power of Sethraliss in this place. My loa endures. Our task ahead is great and I will need a clear, focused mind to accomplish it. Allow me a few moments to meditate here, like I did in ages past. In the meantime, you should help the vulpera stir up trouble however you can. They seem to know you, and a large enough disturbance will distract the Faithless from our mission. Meet me back here when you're done and we'll proceed together. 
Use the Portal to Stormwind.	From the Ashes...	We must return to Stormwind, quickly! 
Find Sergeant Calvin in Brennadam Square.	The Days Are Just Packed	Hello there! Would you mind checking on someone for me? Sergeant Calvin was supposed to meet me here. We were going to go out looking for new alchemical reagents, but he hasn't shown up yet. I know the militia has been really busy lately so I guess he's busy, but he should still be in Brennadam Square. Would you mind checking in on him? 
Find Meerah within Suramar's Twilight Vineyards.	Meet with Meerah	It appears we're making good progress. Would you meet up with Meerah? I want to be sure she's found her way to the vintner in Suramar. 
Speak with Explosioneer Zoidfuse to initiate the Vol'dun Explosion Protocol.	The Big Boom	Still, we've placed all those explosives, and there's nothing stopping us from detonating them and laying waste to the Horde's excavations. Speak with Zoidfuse when you're ready, and we'll get this explosive gnome tech going! 
	PvP Event: Battle for Nazjatar	 
Learn how to dismiss, tame, and stable pets from Austin Huxworth.	The Art of Taming	I'm quite surprised to find this beast still alive and kicking. It appears to like you. Before we finish, you had better learn how to wrangle multiple pets. I'll give you one last lesson. 
Speak with Baine Bloodhoof.	Prepare for a Siege	It would seem we must make ready for a siege. For now, return to your Horde in Dazar'alor. Prepare for de coming conflict. Should de forces of Nazmir surge, I will send word. 
Acquire a Sixteen-Servo-Actuator from Bondo Bigblock.	Ready to Rumble	We're going to need a new Sixteen-Servo-Actuator if we're going to fix the controls on this thing. Bondo's gang at the yard probably has one, but they usually aren't too helpful. Talk to Bondo, see if you can get us one. 
Fly with Hexlord Raal to the Garden of the Loa.	Midnight in the Garden of the Loa	Yazma and her henchtroll Vol'kaal have pulled most of their forces back to de Garden of de Loa. Something bad is afoot, I can feel it in my spirit. Pa'ku is in danger, along with all de loa who have followers dere. Come, let's fly dere and put an end to dese heresies. 
Search for clues to the location of the loa, Bwonsamdi.	The Shadow of Death	We have four loa, but we only know where one is: Bwonsamdi. As uncomfortable as it makes me, I am prepared to do anything to stop de blood trolls... even if it means dealing with de loa of death. Ages ago, Bwonsamdi had a temple here in Nazmir. My scrying has revealed a few locations to de north where I sense a magical presence. Search dem for clues. Hurry, George. Zuldazar will fall if we cannot obtain Bwonsamdi's help! 
Collect 8 Durable Seashells in Rockskip Falls.	Safety First	The connection between horse and rider is fascinating to me, and I will never truly understand until I experience it. But, well, you know... armor! How could I possibly even think to mount one of these beauties without some proper protection? I saw some waterfalls nearby. There must be shells near the banks of its pools! Would you entertain an old Tortollan by collecting some for his safety? 
Test the Wicker Charm on Dormant Ravagers in Fletcher's Hollow until you successfully control one.	Charming the Lifeless	<You've seen a charm like this in Fallhaven being used to control a wicker construct. If you can figure out how to use it, you may be able to take control of one of the coven's wicker constructs.> 
Investigate and defeat what lies within 4 structures in the Forgotten Cove.	Flush Them Out	They lurk in the shadows, in the salt-soaked caverns. The dark brine beneath the pure gleam of the surface. I have seen them. They plague my dreams, their whispers are maddening. They speak of their master, clawing at the barrier...Search the cliffs for their warrens. Find what lurks within and obliterate them all. 
Slay 8 Thieving Snappers in the Zocalo.	Pests	Let me guess, de saurid stole something of yours as well, eh? Look, I don't have de time to run down every little thing dese ankle-biters snap off with. You want some coin? Help me kill some of dese snappers. Otherwise, leave me be. 
Acquire 15 Abyssal Shards from Finder Pruc.	An Abyssal Opportunity	I believe, George, we can use this thing to make our armor stronger. By redirecting its power, we can take the strength of our crafts to a new level. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The first thing we need to do is repair this device. It'll require some powerful materials to fix it, and those are usually carried by the stronger creatures of this region. However, Finder Pruc is great at collecting materials like the ones we need. I'd check with him to see what he's got. 
Evacuate 8 Anglepoint Fishpackers.	Evacuate the Premises	The people of Anglepoint need me to stand tall, to not panic in the face of the unknown. I will admit to not being the best at this. Even now, the fishpackers are handling the tainted product and preparing it for shipment. They are in great danger, and we cannot allow them to stay in harm's way. We must get them to safety! 
Gather the team members.	A Small Team	I've determined the single attribute that is most important for a team member to survive an expedition to Mechagon. That attribute is...being a gnome! Gather these gnomes and meet Tinkmaster Overspark and myself at the departure point. 
Meet with Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind's Redemption in Boralus Harbor.	Operation: Cutpurse	It is time to reconvene for our next mission, though Shandris and I disagree on what exactly that should entail. Meet us on the Wind's Redemption. 
Collect 20 Eternal Ornaments from the most powerful creatures of the Eternal Palace.	The Eternal Palace: We Can Make It Stronger...	Now that it's functioning, it occurred to me while repairing it that it has the capability to output even more energy. Of course that'll require stronger materials to upgrade and the only place I can think of is in the Eternal Palace. Azshara's army and even herself carry items of extraordinary power. If you could bring some of those back, I could at the very least test my theory and see if it's viable. 
Speak to Navarrogg to travel to the Dragon's Spine in Neltharion's Lair.	Take My Hand	Beneath us lies the former home of the dragon Neltharion. You may know him as Deathwing. If your titan watcher friend detected an essence of dragon magic coalescing nearby, it may be an echo of the power of the dragonflights. Such power will be coveted by others as well. This force is likely originating from the most potent area within the lair--the decaying bones of my kin slain in the throes of Deathwing's fury. We must go before the essence falls into the wrong hands. 
Deliver the item to Marvelous Martini.	Paint Vial: Mechagon Gold	<Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.> 
Inform Ralston Karn to prepare for the assault on Darkshore.	We Are Coming	We must press our advantage before the Horde can further its hold on Darkshore. The kaldorei stand ready to fight for our home, and the Gilneans stand alongside us. We will show our enemies our fury. They will learn to fear us. Rally any you can. We march at once. 
Kill 10 Irontide Pirates.	Iron Low Tide	A few years ago I tried to join the Irontide. They said I wasn't ""Irontide material"", not cruel or heartless enough! So I teamed up with Nedly and Moxie here in Deadwash, and we started looking for treasure on our own. Let's show these Irontide they're not ""Deadwash material"". 
Collect Emerald Shards in the Dreamway.	Shards of Emerald	Kalecgos tells me that you seek the power of the dragonflights in its most essential form. There may be something here that can help you. Fragments of our latent power have coalesced here in the Dream. They are scattered about the Dreamway, where my kin have fallen. Within the Dream, you should be able to wield those fragments in their raw state. 
Collect the tongues of Ghaz'ragon.	Punishment of Tal'farrak	De Sandfury tribe may have had a hand in some crime around here, but it is really their false belief system dat makes dem do dis sort of thing. Enter Tal'farrak, bang de gong within, and face de hydra dey keep as a sacred pet. Bring me dis thing's tongues. 
Kill 8 Sawblade Clearcutters and use the Living Sap of Nordrassil to regrow 8 stumps.	Aid From Nordrassil	Look at what they've done to this island, George. Nature is nearly extinguished, its death cry falling on the deaf ears of mechagnomes. But I have heard the teeny tiny animals of Mechagon, and bring aid from afar! It won't be easy to restore balance to a land so severely wounded. Nature's scars run deep here. Thankfully, we are not alone. I've brought living sap from Nordrassil, the World Tree of Mount Hyjal. Use it to regrow the forests and speed nature's recovery in this land. 
Rescue Gonk.	The Hunter	Gonk is in danger. I can hear his call. My loa has saved my life so many times, it is about time I return de favor. Come, join me at de Lair of Gonk on de west side of de Garden of the Loa, and we will save a god. 
Meet Captain Tread Sparknozzle in New Tinkertown.	Shifting Gears	George! The Alliance has made a new request for Gnomeregan's might in the coming war. It is my honor to inform you that Captain Sparknozzle wishes for your expert assistance in the matter. You are hereby requested to meet him in New Tinkertown. 
Follow the tortollan pilgrimage path to reach Torga, loa of the turtles.	Torga, the Turtle Loa	Name's Lashk. We're not here to join any cause, we just want to hear Torga's legendary stories. I don't know if he'll help, but you can try persuading Torga, loa of the turtles, and see if he'll help you fight these blood trolls. You can join on our pilgrimage to Torga, just keep quiet. Follow the path and find Kisha, she'll tell you where to go. 
Collect 12 Chitterspine Spines.	A Little Edge	In the darkest cavern. Below the naga city. You will find them. Creepy little crabs with sharp and pointy spines. I think we can find a way to use them. Projectiles didn't work so well in water, but now...Harvest some for us! Be careful, some of them are much sneakier than they have any right to be. 
Defeat 12 Zandalari forces within the Fallen Outpost.	Showing Our Might	We are within reach of the Blood Gate in Zandalar. Once we take that, the Horde and Zandalari will believe our full invasion has begun. Our forces have already engaged the Zandalari within the Fallen Outpost. We'll need your help to push them back. I'll be focusing on finishing off what remains of the Horde and Zandalari back in Zul'jan ruins. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Living Statues Are Tough	 
Upgrade a piece of Benthic armor through Voidbinder Zorlan.	Create Your Own Strength	For something that has been sitting on the ocean floor, there is still power to be found in this item. Take your piece of Benthic armor to Voidbinder Zorlan. He has been eyeing it with great curiosity. Go ahead and humor the ethereal and let him have a look. Maybe he has something to offer. 
Learn about the threats facing Uldum in Ramkahen.	The Uldum Accord	You seek assistance defending the Forge of Origination? It would seem that our goals align. The Halls of Origination are but a small portion of the forge's true scope. Any threat to Uldum would be a potential threat to the forge, and Uldum has found itself with many new enemies of late. We were about to convene the High Council when these Wastewanders arrived unannounced. Perhaps you could join us in learning about these threats? 
Use the Deepflame Campfire, choose an ally, and complete 3 ally quests.	A Worthy Ally	Some of our bravest ankoan have volunteered to join you on your expedition. You will find each have their own special interests and they will mark your map with different opportunities every day. Use the Deepflame Campfire when you are ready. Choose a noble ally to join you, and explore what remains of Nazjatar. Choose wisely! You may only select one friend per day. 
Take the Collected Tidebloom Honey to ""Nasty"" Buck in Brennadam.	Unbeelievable Quality	<Now that your harvester has matured, the Honeyback hive is creating additional honey. Someone in Brennadam could certainly find a use for this honey.> 
Deliver the item to Marvelous Martini.	Paint Vial: Big-ol Bronze	<Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.> 
Meet Kaza'jin the Wavebinder near the Terrace of the Chosen.	Terrace of the Chosen	This betrayal has cut deep into the heart of Zandalar. Half of the Zanchuli Council and their followers have sided with Zul and his... blood god. Lucky for us not all of Zandalar is behind this betrayal. We need to topple Zul's cultists before they can rally too many to their cause. Zanchul is the place to start. Go and see if you can muster any of the Zandalari still loyal to their king. 
Collect 4 Mechaspider Leg and 12 Toe Springs.	A Little Leg Work	The legs and shocks on this mount are shot! We'll need some new ones if we're going to get this mount crawling. A few weeks ago, Bondo and his gang rode into the Scrapbone Den hoping to scare the Troggs off. The Troggs tore their crawlers apart! The parts for those crawlers are still laying all around Scrapbone Den. See if you can get us some of those parts from the Troggs. 
Slay 10 Roughnecks in Timberfell Outpost.	Our Mountain Now	George, go take care of those ""roughnecks."" They might fashion themselves as tough, but a bit of your unique brand of Horde savagery should have them running in no time. Lilian, scout the area. We need to know about any nearby threats. Rangers, secure the perimeter. We'll reconvene in the roughneck camp once George's work is done. 
Destroy Horde Zeppelins in Anglepoint Wharf.	Zero Zeppelins	The Horde zeppelins proved to be problematic for our forces here. I tried to construct something quickly, but while the weapon had power, it didn't have the range necessary to take them out. The Lord Admiral has provided us with an expedient solution to the problem! Use this jury-rigged hand cannon on the zeppelins. A quick application of high energy and heat will cause thermal shock and critical failure! To simplify, blow them up while they're grounded! 
Accept a gift from your companion.	Beauty in the Deeps	We have slain many enemies, spilled much blood on the sand. My skills have improved tenfold fighting at your side. Yet let us not forget that once, this was a place of peace. Once, my people walked amongst the caverns and reefs undisturbed. There is beauty, here, in the depths, all around us. Take a moment, sit, and enjoy your serene surroundings. Look here, a crab with a shell of brilliant colors. You see? There is beauty here, even now. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Small Beginnings	 
Take the root to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade.	Strangling Root	<The root twists and struggles in your grip, attempting to wrap itself around your arm. The keepers you encountered must be powerfully attuned to nature to imbue their creations with such longetivity. Remembering the ferocity with which they fought against you makes you suddenly uneasy. Why would these guardians of nature behave this way? Surely, someone must have the answers.> 
Bloody the Glaive of Vol'jin in G'huun's corpse.	Justice for the Fallen	Justice for da sons and daughters of lost loa. Justice for da heart of Zandalar. G'huun must be slain, and a symbol of his death displayed to those who need see it most. Take me glaive, drive it into da corpse of dat beast, and let Talanji show it to her people. Let peace be started in da hearts of da Zandalari. 
Speak with Baine Bloodhoof.	Informing the Horde	General Jakra'zet has been defeated, but his plan to summon Mythrax succeeded despite our best efforts. Were it not for the mercy of Sethraliss, I doubt we would have made it out of Atul'Aman alive. We must inform our allies of what has transpired in Vol'dun. I'll speak with princess Talanji myself. You should go and speak with the Horde. We need all the help we can get now. I'm sure our paths will cross again, George. It was an honor fighting with you. 
Examine 4 Grave Plaques in Barrowknoll Cemetery.	Examining the Epitaphs	Without Stone's knowledge, this mission shall require some extra legwork. Read the plaques in the cemetery. Find the corpse of the most import. The rest should be quite simple. 
Kill 25 Horde players in Nazjatar while in War Mode.	Drowning the Horde	We must strike now before the Horde have a chance to gain a secure foothold. Attack their champions and knock them on their heels. 
Ride Swiftwing to the Isle of Fangs.	Under the Cover of Swiftwing	Aye! So we be the first in this crazy operation. We'll be hitchin' a ride on Swiftwing to tha Isle of Fangs. The Zandalari got one of their main ships there, called the Breath of Pa'ku, whatever that is. Hop on ta Swiftwing when yer ready te go. It's gonna get real cozy on there with all of ye comin' aboard. 
Collect 8 Pricklevine Juice.	Freshly Squeezed	Is this troll a friend of yours? I'm so glad Kiro let me keep her. He's a bit wary of outsiders, but he's a great healer. She'll wake up, I promise. And when she does, she'll be thirsty. The sands are short on water, but you're in luck. The grove that surrounds this camp is filled with pricklevines. You wouldn't want to eat the flesh, but the liquid inside can quench any thirst. Just give them a good squeeze to collect their juice. 
Hunt down Ayame and obtain its head.	WANTED: Ayame	Well equipped exterminator wanted. Huge snake seen lurking north of Fort Victory. Reward offered for anyone who brings in the head of the pest.-Garrick Blacksteel 
Witness Baine welcome the vulpera into the Horde.	New Allies Among Us	Even in times of peace, the Horde is not without its problems. Although they can be overwhelming at times, our struggles should never stop us from remembering what it means to be a part of the Horde. We don't turn people away when times get tough; we band together and endure. For a moment I forgot this. Burdened by the troubles facing our new allies, I hastily dismissed the vulpera. My only hope is that they still see as much value in the Horde as I see in them. 
Recover the Fetish of Loti.	Rescuing the Taken	We are doing our best to contain de fighting in Zanchul and not let it spill out into de other terraces, but we can't hold for long. If you are going to help, start by freeing Wardruid Loti. Dey are trying to break her on de platform above with a dark ritual. Her soul is bound to a fetish. You must find dat fetish if you are going to free her. 
Find Tyrande in Darkshore and lend her aid.	In Darkest Night	George, I will not mince words. Tyrande foolishly risks her life with the ritual she intends to perform. If she falls, our entire war effort will fall with her. We must set off for Darkshore and come to her aid. Only then can we march forward and reclaim our homeland. We have lost Teldrassil. Fool or not, our people cannot afford to lose Tyrande as well. 
Put on the Irontide Hat and enter Freehold with Flynn.	Dress to Impress	Freehold used to be open to anyone, but now it seems the Irontide Raiders have declared themselves the owners. They're locking the place down and turning away anyone who isn't part of the crew. Fortunately, they're also hiring. Put this on. Don't think about where it came from. We'll pose as new recruits, get in, gather some information, and be back in Boralus in time for supper! Cyrus may be salty, but he's a decent cook. 
Find the source of N'Zoth's whispers in the Chamber of Heart.	Whispers in the Dark	Did ye hear that as well? That cannae be good. If N'Zoth gains access tae this chamber, we'll all be done for! We need tae figure out where he's accessing the chamber and shut it down, before he does more than just whisper at us! 
Report to Captain Delaryn Summermoon in Astranaar.	A Disturbance in Ashenvale	The damned Horde! Clever bastards, I'll give them that. They diverted at the north fork of the Barrens and are now marching on Ashenvale. The kaldorei forces already set sail for Silithus--must be halfway there by now. The only defenders still in the area are the Darnassian City Guard. They are en route to Astranaar, but they won't last long against an army. Their commander goes by the name of Delaryn Summermoon. Find her, George, and buy us time. We will get our fleet there as soon as we can. 
Punchcard Satchel recovered.	First One's Free	The pocket-sized computational device can accept punch cards to upgrade and modify its performance. I could give you a punch card, but a particularly crafty trogg, Moch'k Eight-Thumbs, stole my satchel full of cards. Kill Moch'k Eight-Thumbs, recover my satchel, and I'll set you up with a punch card for free. 
Lead the Alliance assault into Zuldazar.	Ritual Rampage	The Alliance has launched an assault into the very heart of the Zandalari empire. Defeat the Horde on their own soil to show them our strength! 
Meet Taelia in the Harbormaster's Office in Boralus.	A New Dawn	House Stormsong may be lost, but this valley still holds so much hope. Sam knew that from the beginning. We have to continue to help the Storm's Wake in any way we can. There are still remnants of the fallen house everywhere, and whoever turned them to this darkness is out there as well. Cyrus and the others will want to hear about everything that happened. We should tell them together. 
Collect 20 Empty Energy Cells	Emission Free	We're going to need a few Empty Energy Cells to fill out the battery pack on the mount control assembly. See if you can find me these. 
Kill 20 Grimestone troggs in Norwington Estate.	No Party Like a Trogg Party	Troggs? At my party? My grandfather pushed them back to that cleft years ago to build this estate. To think that they would attack in such force after all these years? This is just what we needed to make this year's festival the greatest ever! Show us your heroism firsthand, George! Mount Cooper and defeat these troggs! Drag them behind you, jab them with your harpoon... whatever it takes! 
Repair the device.	Let's Get It Started	I theorize this to be a communication relay. It is non-operational, but gnomish ingenuity and your strong back shall soon solve that problem! I need you to help get this device functional. 
Slay Greenstalker.	Greenstalker	The mighty wolf Greenstalker was once a protector of these forests. He has fallen under the sway of dark forces. My brother and I attempted to calm his spirit, but he is too far gone. Use the charm I have constructed to weaken him. I ask you Mechanic, please, end his suffering. My brother is still weak and I must stay to protect him. Go now before the wolf consumes us all! 
Drive it to the check point, reach Maximum speed, and test the emergency brake.	Test Drive	There's still a lot of work to do, but it's running! We need to give the engine, brakes and gyro-balance actuator a good test. You want to take it out for a drive and see how well they work? 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Snakes on a Terrace	 
Slay 8 Kao-Tien Marauders, Subjugators, or Charged Sentinels.	Wrath of the Zandalari	Dere is no reasoning with de mogu. Dey only value one thing: strength. Dat is something de Zandalari have like no other, but our forces are spread thin. We are simply not prepared to fight dem. You have proven yourself a capable warrior, for |5Human. Would you be our ""ambassador"" to dese brutes? Show dem dat de Zandalari do not stand alone! 
Gather 15 Zandalari Water Jugs and 15 Zandalari Rations.	Improvised Survival	The entirety of our copter's hold was reserved for bombs. There's actually still a lot of bombs left inside. Unfortunately, that meant that we weren't able to pack sufficient water and rations for our survival. Desert natives hoard supplies efficiently. I'm certain the Zandalari trolls up ahead wouldn't miss a few lost supplies. 
Defeat 12 blood trolls within Zalamar.	Repurposing Their Village	Myself and Shaw will provide support for Telaamon's army until our distraction is set up. First, we need to clear the blood trolls out of their nearby village, Zalamar, in order to move our army forward. That's where you come in. We need you to assault the blood trolls there to weaken their forces, then our army will arrive. Telaamon will be on site to help you, meet with him once you've weakened their forces. I will be here with Shaw ensuring our forces aren't seen. 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Emergency Rocket Chicken	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be an aeronautically inclined poultry unit. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Return the Child of Torcali to her nest in Warbeast Kraal.	Torcali's Blessing	<Torcali's voice enters your mind.>Your actions speak to your intentions, George. I can see that my child will have the care she needs to grow strong, and grow she will. In the coming days she will recover the strength that would have been hers, if nature had been allowed to take its course. Tend to her, earn her loyalty, and I will allow you to keep her at your side. This is my gift to you. You may go now. She will bring you to me when it is time. 
Find the Warchief's Orders.	You Have Their Orders	The Horde is an army, make no mistake. And armies need orders. Someone must be giving orders here. They know the plan, and I want to know the plan too. Look for the people who seem to be in charge and see if you can uncover any intelligence so we know what to do next. 
Find and rescue 7 Captured Farmers and Farmer Deal.	Boaring Company	I don't see her body anywhere. That means she could still be alive. The Briarback have been taking prisoners, and anyone who has ever been taken by them was never seen again. We have a single chance here and we need to take it! Come with me into the kraul and free as many of the survivors as you can. And if you can, find Farmer Deal. See if she's still alive. 
Speak to MOTHER to travel to the Maelstrom.	An Old Scar	We've got a new problem, champion. Another grievous wound has opened up, this time at the Maelstrom! The shaman there are in deep trouble, an' they need our help! Speak tae MOTHER. She'll get ye tae the Maelstrom. I'll meet ye there. 
Drink the Humanizing Potion, then question the citizens of Redridge Mountains.	Corner Crossing	If Saurfang was headed in this direction, it would have been difficult for him to avoid the Three Corners watchpost. We could simply walk in there and demand information, but I have a feeling that they would not part with it willingly. So we will take another approach. I have procured this potion from our alchemists. It will turn us into--ugh--humans for a while. We can then question the guards. Perhaps someone saw something. 
Meet with Boss Mida at Warfang Hold in Stormsong Valley.	Securing Warfang Hold	The Dark Lady has important work for you, George. Preparations are beginning for a meeting of the Horde's leadership at Warfang Hold. I trust I don't need to emphasize that security is of the highest import for this gathering. The goblin, Gallywix, has sent his underlings to make sure the area is swept of any... unwanted guests. I need you to make sure they succeed in their task. 
Locate the Brass Key at the bottom of the lagoon.	The Sunken Chest	<This waterlogged chest appears to be in salvageable condition, but it is too heavy to move due to the contents within. The lock on the device appears to be operational. Perhaps there is a key nearby...> 
Fill Zelling's Void Font by slaying enemies in Port Fogtide and unleash his devastating wind magic.	Zelling's Potential	<cough> My body won't last much longer, but Miss Voss insists I display what my powers truly are. I can instill within you a <cough> <wheeze> magical font that will absorb void essence from slain creatures. When the font is full, you can unleash devastating wind magic. Go to <cough> Port Fogtide. There you will find those tainted by the Void. Slay them, fill the font, and you will <wheeze> see my magic at work. 
Report to Master Mathias Shaw for further instruction.	The Horde Uprising	Given the potential of Azerite to change the face of warfare, it comes as no surprise that the Warchief seeks to lay claim to it. Reports indicate that she is mobilizing an army to march on Silithus--the site of the great wound. Heroes of the Horde and the Alliance fought side-by-side during the Argus campaign. To think that Sylvanas is ready to cast that unity aside...Speak with Mathias Shaw. I want you to oversee our presence in Silithus. 
Defeat Telaamon's mirror images within Zalamar.	Breaking Mirrors	We have reports dat Telaamon, de Lightforged in charge of dis attack, can create mirror images of himself to strike us down. Two Zandalari, Witch Doctor Kejabu and Jo'chunga, have offered to go in and help fight his mirror images. I want you to ensure dey survive. Eliminating dese strange images should make Telaamon weaker, allowing you and Rokhan to slay him. 
Recover the Murloc Treasure Bag.	Go For The Gold	I've heard lot's of stories about dead fathers, mothers, and family treasures. Don't believe any of it. We're all here to get any pirate gold, before these mecha-fools get it first! If there's gold to be had here, it's in that fat chest the murlocs are guarding. Kill their chief, empty out the chest, and we'll split it fifty-fifty, since I'm telling ya about it. 
Destroy Pummeller Red, Pummeller Orange, and Pummeller Grey	Unprofitable Ventures	This land is already a monumental disaster, but it could get worse! The Venture Company is here, and will exploit this land for every ounce of profit they can make. We must make their venture here unprofitable, so they will leave. Destroy the three expensive security units with them, and they may leave for more profitable ventures. 
Seek revenge on Sister Ava.	The Rising Tide	This mainspring wasn't altered by an engineer. These runes on the surface can only have come from a tidesage. Their aquatic magic is unmistakable. I'd bet whoever did this is also responsible for Addington's death. Whoever they are, they're likely still nearby. Keep an eye out... they won't be hard to find. 
Meet Princess Talanji in the Hall of High Priests at Zanchul.	Wisdom of the Warchief	Champion. For a brief moment after the battle with G'huun, the spirit of our old warchief, Vol'jin, appeared in view of all in Zuldazar. I had a hundred questions to ask my old friend, but his spirit faded before I could muster my voice. I have asked Talanji to perform her seance once more, so that I might speak with the spirit of Vol'jin. Will you collect the Glaive of Vol'jin from its resting place at the base of the pyramid and then join us at Zanchul? 
Upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database.	Blueprint: Microbot XD	<This blueprint details how to build what appears to be an adorable miniature robot. You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.> 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Not So Bad Down Here	 
Retrieve Lord Norwington's favorite horse Rose from his hilltop estate.	Equine Retrieval	I like the cut of your jib, friend! I'll tell you what. The rest of the partygoers should be arriving any time now. Would you do me the honor of retrieving my favorite horse from the estate on the hill? Imagine, our guests' first impression of you to be on the most regal horse in all of Tiragarde! Wondrous! 
Find treasures hidden away by magic within Nazjatar.	Scrying Stones	I have a gift for you, George. This stone is unlike anything you may have seen before. To the uninformed, it appears to be a simple rock, but it is far more precious than that. This is a scrying stone. It reveals objects that have been hidden by magic. When near an anomaly, the runes etched within will begin to glow. Use the stone to reveal treasure hidden away by ancient magic. 
Collect 8 Ashenwood Relics.	Those Who Remain	<The runes on the wooden plaque glow faintly with an ancient magic. It looks like it is a small piece of a larger record.><One of the Thornspeakers at the Teller Farm would probably recognize what this is.> 
Get everything needed to launch the expedition for Mechagon.	Only the Best Will Do	You heard Gazlowe. The boss wants this expedition to go smoothly. No cutting corners, no slush. I know you've worked with Gallywix in the past. We don't run our operations like that. We expect the best from our crews, so we pay 'em what they're worth and treat 'em well. In return, we got the best goblin crews on the planet, and they ain't goin' over to any competition. Here's a list of who and what we're gonna need to pull this off. Don't worry, Gazlowe'll cover all the costs. 
Investigate the villagers' writings in Fallhaven.	Signs and Portents	<The bulletin that Mayor White was posting at the time he was struck by the spell indicates that there have been some strange happenings in the town lately. It is likely these events are connected to whatever cast this spell on the village. Perhaps there might be records from other villagers that could shed some light on the source of this magic.> 
Report to Halford Wyrmbane aboard Wind's Redemption in Boralus Harbor.	Changing Course	Champion, the time for action is upon us. Developments are underway that will change the course of this war. Report to me aboard Wind's Redemption as soon as possible. 
Collect Valentine's Key from Brutus Thornton.	The Crypt Keeper	I've been keeping my sights on the cemetery. There is one ghost that walks with a purpose, unlike the others. He is the crypt keeper, the keeper of the keys. If we want to get to Valentine's body, we will need to go through the ghost first. 
Feed your hatchling.	Direhorn Daycare	Handler Bazkoji had a real gift with de little ones. If dis hatchling is following you, it must mean Bazkoji is dead. I don't have time to find another handler. Are you up to de task? It's a lot of work, and de little ones get attached real fast. If you're going to care for it, it will be a commitment. That baby will be depending on you. I hope you will be up to de task of feeding and protecting it. First things first: food. Dere is plenty of fodder in de pens and river below. 
Use the Poisoned Mojo Flask to Poison 5 Tamed Warspawn.	Poisoning the Brood	Now we have room for our plan to kill Hir'eek. You see, George, my specialty is in making potions and poisons. I am working on a poison to use on Hir'eek, when de time comes. I have no idea if it will work or not. I want you to take what I already made and use it on de bats around here. It should kill dem instantly. If it works, den I can make it stronger with my voodoo and give us a chance at killing Hir'eek. 
Collect 20 Salvaged Azerite Ammunition.	A Pocketful of Shells	You see the problem? No you don't. Problem isn't all these dang quilboar. Quilboar I can shoot all day. Been shootin' em all my life, since my pappy gave me my first gun. Problem is these pigs are tough. Tougher'n they've been before. Can't kill em like I used to, see? My new modified bullets just get stuck in them and they refuse to die! Here, take my knife. Go out there and kill some of the quilboar and get my ammo back. Then I can shoot the rest! I won't stop 'till there's none left to shoot! 
Help Rexxar track down a tidesage.	No Price Too High	I have tracked a tidesage to a camp nearby. He has been staying there with his family. Be warned, tidesages are powerful foes. They have mastery over all the elements, and some even manipulate the Void. If this man is with his family, it means he may not give up so easily. Let us hope he's smart enough to keep them out of this. Come. 
Assault the naga camp and seize control of the Tidestone of Golganneth.	Changing Tides	We are out of time. We must gain control the Tidestone of Golganneth and the Javelin is our best shot at piercing the barrier surrounding it. The guardian is formidable, but must be defeated if we are to take the fight to Azshara. What forces we have will be arrayed below, just outside their encampment. I would trust you with the Javelin of Suramar, George. We will need your strength in the coming battle. 
	Mindshackle	 
Summon Krag'wa to ask for his help.	Petitioning Krag'wa	Nothing! I cannot believe de weapon had no effect! Damn Ateena and her dark magic! We must get up there somehow, kill her for good, and remove dat barrier! But how can we get to de top of dat building... ah, of course! Krag'wa! De loa of frogs hates de blood trolls. I am sure he will lend us his aid. Then, finally, we will be able to put an end to Ateena's madness. 
Bring Mrrl a Sweet Sea Vegetable, an Unidentified Mass, a Flatulent Fish, and a Slimy Naga Eyeball.	No Backs	<The murloc seems hungry. Next to it is a series of crude drawings which seems like a shopping list. Perhaps you can help the creature.> 
	Undana, Chilling Assassin	 
Sail with Jaina to meet Baine off the coast of Theramore.	My Brother's Keeper	While I trust Valeera believes she is not leading us into a trap, I do not trust this isn't a Horde manipulation. George, I want you to come with me. I will meet with Baine, but I will not do so alone. 
Evacuate MOTHER from Uldir	A One-Way Ticket to the Heart	These titan facilities never cease tae amaze me. I can only imagine how many of their secrets Brann has yet tae uncover. I just hope that one o' them holds the answer tae saving Azeroth. It's time tae bring MOTHER tae the Chamber of Heart. Be prepared for anythin', champion. Ye can never be quite sure what will happen when ye activate a titan machine. 
Deliver 5 Disintegrating Sand Sculpture to Steelsage Gao.	Other Interests	Madam Goya is interested in many unusual items other than just rare metals. Keep your eyes out for these particular items during your travels in Nazjatar. Deliver them to me and Madam Goya will consider you for special access. 
Destroy Vol'jamba's masks.	Arrogance of Vol'jamba	Vol'jamba thinks his Sight has surpassed mine. I warned against such arrogance many years ago, but we see how well he listened.<Zul chuckles.>No doubt he will attempt to deter us as we encroach upon his sanctum. Listen if you like, but remember dat he is desperate to save himself. His truth is distorted by fear. Destroy his masks and we will walk unharmed through dis passage. 
Collect 8 Bunches of Seaweed from Harbor Seaweed.	A Cure from the Sea	You may not believe it, but seaweed is one of the most important gifts the sea grants to us. Without it, my tonic shall be useless. I know it is much to ask, but can you go into the harbor and collect some for me? The water is tumultuous in this trying time, but I will give you my blessing. 
Collect 20 Zeth'jir Harpoons on the coast south of Fort Daelin.	Any Ammo Will Do	I'll have some men move some cannons down to the sea wall in preparation of whatever ritual is going on down in that delta. We could use some extra ammo before we spread ourselves too thin though. Luckily, those naga harpoons work well enough with our mortars. Take down those lances and bring back any harpoons that you find. 
Accompany Kelya Moonfall into the Highborne Estates to search for the spirit of her father.	The High Life	You there, I require some help. Everyone where I once called home lost their lives to the flood. I still don't know what became of my father, Corin. It pains me to return to the estates, and there are vengeful spirits who haunt the once pristine grounds. Will you help me find out what happened to my father? 
Travel on Galeheart to Stormsong Valley.	Time to Leave	I knew it! I knew the fleet wasn't just lost! We may be a little in over our heads here. Let's leave before things get out of hand. Galeheart can take us to Stormsong Valley from here. No point in following tradition at this point, right? 
Report to Ralston Karn in Boralus Harbor.	The Warfront Looms	We cannot myopically focus all our efforts on Zandalar. Horde treachery simmers all across the globe. One particular hot spot lies in the Arathi Highlands, near the storied citadel of Stromgarde. The Horde has set up an encampment nearby, and intends to capture our territory. Speak with Ralston Karn, the recruitment officer for the division in charge of this particular warfront. He could use a good Mechanic like you. 
Collect 4 Venomous Barbs from Barbtail Stingrays.	Stinging Barbs	The Outrigger hunters exhibit the pinnacle of Kul Tiran brawn. But they would indubitably be unable to succeed in taking down the most impressive of their prey without my own inventions! I present to you, the most ordinary of harpoons. However, with just a tad of gnomish ingenuity, this average weapon can become so much more! All that I need are barbs from the rays in the harbor. Using them, I can fashion a poison that can stun even the most colossal of sea monsters! 
Bury 8 Remote-Detonation Deathbombs.	Delayed Deathification	While we can handle the assassination portion on our own, I suppose there's no harm in distributing these gnomish bombs around the enemy's digsite. They're designed to be detonated remotely, so try to bury them in the sand where they won't be noticed. 
Slay a Sabertusk Empress	WANTED: Sabertusk Empress	To any and all brave enough to seek the challenge: Find and defeat a ferocious Sabertusk Empress, the strongest and most vicious of all sabertusks in Zuldazar. They can be found up and down the road from the Village in the Vines. A reward for any that succeed! 
Use the Magister Umbric's Void Portal to join him in Atal'Dazar.	A Greedy Goblin's Paradise	The Zandalari have many powerful and ancient artifacts tucked away on this island, hidden from view. But some of their treasures are more... conspicuous. It is no surprise that Trade Prince Gallywix was unable to resist the allure of Atal'Dazar, a massive city made entirely of gold. Come with me and we will hunt him down together. 
Ride Kelsey's Enlarged Miniaturized Submarine to Warport Rastari.	The Enlarged Miniaturized Submarine	Our next target is a ship docked in a place across from here, the Warport Rastari. Lucky for you, I can get us all there in my enlarged miniaturized submarine. Shandris Feathermoon and Magister Umbric should be waiting for you on the coast of Warport Rastari. Let's get going! 
Free Samuel Williams.	Forced Labor	<The laborer struggles to speak through the magic binding him.>H... help... us...<He achingly lifts a finger, gesturing towards the nearby anchor.>Please... 
Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller on the Banshee's Wail in the Port of Zandalar.	Operation: Hook and Line	Thanks to the help of our new allies, we have devised a plan to extract a powerful tidesage artifact from Boralus. I have already sent Valentine to get us started. Report to the Banshee's Wail posthaste. 
Make a donation to the war effort. You can donate gold, War Resources, or crafted equipment. Only some NPCs will accept donations each day.	Warfront Contribution	A well-trained army will only get us so far, George. We also need money, food, and supplies to keep our army funded, fed, and ready to fight. Show some pride and give what you can. For the Horde! 
Help Shandris assassinate Elisa Veilsong and Daxx Bombhand, then find out what they know.	Classic Reliquary	Another goblin surveyor, and this one's reporting to a blood elf overseer of some sort. We're closing in on them, George. You know the drill. 
Install the vinyl into the Rustbolt Gramophone.	Vinyl: Gnomeregan Forever	<This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Gnomeregan Forever.""You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.> 
Confront Helena Gentle in her home outside of Fallhaven.	The Wayward Crone	<The ledger indicates that an old woman named Helena Gentle recently took up residence in a house down the road from the town. The villagers' writings point to her being involved somehow with a variety of maladies that struck the village recently. It's possible that she may know what's behind this spell, if it hasn't afflicted her as well.> 
Escort Mrrl back to Mezzamere.	A Safer Place	<The murloc seems to be in rough shape. Perhaps it would be safer with your allies in Mezzamere.> 
Defeat the Horde at the Battle for Stromgarde.	Heroic Warfront: The Battle for Stromgarde	If the Horde thinks it can assault Stromgarde, it is sorely mistaken! We will not let Arathi fall! Prepare yourself for battle. 
	Cursed Chest	 
Slay Dregada.	Dire Situation	Good news, we found de source of de corruption. De bad news, it is a ritual on de apex of Zanchul. Blood magic wielding heretics are empowering some sort of dire troll up dere. How it made it all de way to de apex without us catching it is something I am sure Raal and I will be arguing about for de next year. Come, let us stop dis heresy. 
Follow Bladeguard Kaja.	Rumors of Exile	Talanji sent you, didn't she? De princess needs to know dat it is no longer safe to ask such questions so openly. Warguard Rakera spoke out, and no one has heard from her since. Rumor has it she was exiled to Vol'dun. 
Solve the riddle.	Battered Twilight Scale	<The worn scale of a twilight dragon, it has seen many years of fighting. The twilight dragons were thought to have been defeated with the fall of Sinestra, how were there so many on the island? And who is leading the flight?> 
Kill Advisor Ko'jan.	Silencing the Advisor	The ship's captain is nowhere to be found. Shandris and Falstad will handle locating him. We must go after the ship's advisor. Kelsey's logs indicate her name is Ko'jan. She may have methods to reach out to the mainland. We have to move before she tries to use any of them. 
Bring Vol'jin's ashes to Atal'Dazar.	Atal'Dazar: Ashes of a Warchief	I have learned much of de Darkspear lately. Truth is, I have quietly admired dem since I was a little girl, hearin' of Vol'jin's defiance of Zul's reckless call to action. Vol'jin was Warchief of the Horde, chieftain of de Darkspear, and more troll den most can claim to be. His ashes should be honored in a place of kings and queens. Take de ashes to Atal'Dazar with my blessing and honor your former Warchief as he deserves. 
Defeat Foreman Razorgnarl.	Sic 'Em!	Humphrey's a good tracker, to be sure. He's also the orneriest, angriest, most dogged dog if he sets his eyes on a quilboar. This will certainly be useful. Below our very noses, the foreman organizes and directs the tunnelers to cause the most mayhem and destruction. If you can put an end to him, it should make things a lot easier for us to move around the farmlands. Humphrey looks a bit hungry, wouldn't you say? Why don't you bring him with you to take care of business? 
Deliver recruitment orders to Captain Cleardawn, Ensign Yorrick, Ensign Mace, Lieutenant Sterntide, and Falconer Notley in Arom's Stand.	Changing of the Guard	I have no doubt that you're a quite capable Mechanic, mainlander, but we will need some help if we want to make it to Waycrest Manor in one piece. A small group would be ideal; strong enough to face the coven's threats, but small enough to remain largely unnoticed.<Reade produces a bundle of letters.>I have written new orders to some of my finest soldiers to join your Order of Embers. They will report to you and the lady Waycrest. Please deliver these to them, so they can be prepared to move out. 
Use Jaina's Water Elemental to clear out Zul'jan Ruins.	Zul'jan Deluge	Through the mists is Zul'jan ruins, a major Horde outpost in Nazmir. We need to take it over to help our forces push forward. The Horde needs to believe a large Alliance army is here, so we're going to throw everything we've got at taking the ruins. Our army will charge forward to attack, while you join them using my water elemental. Meet me outside of the ruins when you're done, we'll need to keep pushing forward. 
Speak with MOTHER in the Chamber of Heart to track Ra-den's location.	Into Dreams	I cannae believe that Ra-den sacrificed himself to save us. We cannae give up on him! There must be a way tae find out where he went. Let's see if MOTHER can track him down! 
Find Mathias Shaw in The Screaming Pit above Warfang Hold.	Shaw's Shank Redemption	Hmm. Shaw said he'd check in when we got communications back but he hasn't. He's probably run into the same trouble the rest of our spies did. I'll stay here and guard the listening post. You find Shaw. He was headed for the cliff above Warfang Hold near the top of the waterfall. The peons called that area ""The Screaming Pit"" for some reason. I bet it's a real pleasant place. Stab whatever he's fighting for me, okay? 
Confront Gorak Tul.	In the Hall of the Drust King	I've been watching a lot of activity going on at the ruins at the base of the massive tree by the lake. What Master Ashton reported is accurate - something important is going on down there. We've disrupted their rituals but I worry we might have been too late. We need to go over there. If there is anything remaining, we must destroy it. 
Collect the Chemist's Notes and a Raw Azerite Sample.	Sampling the Goods	Bridgeport is a major trade hub for this area. Naturally, Ashvane has offices and workshops here. Check around town and see if you can learn anything about this new material and how they're using it. If you can lift a sample for us to send back to Boralus, even better. I gotta stay here and keep an eye on someone. 
Complete the Brinestone Cove event.	What Will It Mine?	<Although worn from repeated use, the pickaxe still seems salvageable. Perhaps there's something nearby that can be mined?> 
Collect 8 Voodoo Totems.	Fuel for the Voodoo	Dere be no time! Dey be draining our spirits... using us... dark voodoo...<Loa Priestess Izita's spirit grows dim, and her voice is soft and distant.>Da totems... burn dem...Den we be free...! 
Read 3 Stormsong Proclamations.	Proclamation Investigation	My lord seldom leaves our holdings along the northern coast, and visitors are expressly forbidden. For most, tidesages like myself are their only connection to the house proper. Lord Stormsong usually delivers orders through proclamations posted throughout the valley. None have reached Brennadam, but if there are any posted here we may be able to find some answers. 
Collect 3 Worldvein Intelligence Reports.	Worldvein Rumors	Gather intelligence to assist SI:7 in identifying the location of the Fluctuating Worldvein. 
Collect lumber to build forward barricades.	Building Defenses	We'll be able to push those monsters back now, but my defenders won't stand a chance unless we build a forward barricade for protection. There should be plenty of lumber to build a barricade near the entrance to town. 
	Champion: Lilian Voss	 
Catch 200 Ionized Minnows.	Tidying Up	Ionized Minnows are a scourge of these waters. They strip the ocean floors of any food, making it difficult for other species to survive. These fish have little to offer other than being a food source for larger fish. I want to see these larger fish, so I have a plan to clear the waters of these minnows and lure the bigger fish out from its hiding place. Let's start by using my Minnow Vac to catch Ionized Minnows for me. 
Collect 30 Ounces of Soul from enemies within Tal'gurub.	The Urn of Voices	Vol'jamba does possess de Sight, and so even now he is taking precautions against us. Regrettably his vision is incomplete. You will help me prepare for his demise and deal with his followers simultaneously. De tool you will use is called de Urn of Voices. Take it and venture into Tal'gurub. Slay his followers, destroy their golems and masks. Their spirits, once released, will fill de urn. Oh, and try not to die while holding it. De Urn of Voices is not discerning. 
Recover 12 souls using the Dead Ringer.	Lost, Not Forgotten	I know not what madness has overtaken my people, but we must stop it together. Take this bell. It calls the souls of the recently deceased to it for later release. We Stormsong do not bury our dead in the earth. The tides claim all. If they will not answer to reason, then we must give them eternal peace. Fallen or not, they are Stormsong. 
Investigate the first expedition warlock's corpse.	A Warlock's Bargain	While scouting the area, I saw an open portal near the bridge up the hill. That does not bode well for any of us. It seemed like another warlock tried to seal the portal, but failed. I know you dabble in such... affairs. Perhaps you could put your knowledge to good use and close that portal. 
Accompany Shadow Hunter Ty'jin to Tiragarde Sound.	Shiver Me Timbers	It seems our resident shadow hunter has managed to seize a small pirate sloop. We have sent him to Tiragarde Sound in a search for a foothold, and it seems that he has concocted a plan. Ty'jin has requested your help, personally. Do not keep him waiting. 
Kill Anthemusa.	Can't Hear A Thing	These snake wenches show up and everyone loses their minds! All my men are head over heels for these things. Personally, I don't see it. I mean, I sort of get the appeal, but the wings for arms and snake tails are a big turn off. There's a big one in a cave to the east. She's got a whole heap of suitors. I need them back to work. Go give her a wallop and get everyone back here. 
Speak with Angus Ballaster to create a silver weapon at Watchman's Rise.	An Improvised Arsenal	I don't know much about blacksmithing, but I'm pretty sure this won't be enough silver to outfit all of the Inquisitors. We will need to find another way to use this. Let us hope that Ballaster can come up with something... creative. 
Escape with Eitrigg and meet up with Saurfang in Razor Hill.	Not My Warchief	There is little time. Sylvanas likely knows of my intentions and sent you to deal with me accordingly. I doubt she will be pleased with your decision. We must make our way to the wyverns and take to the skies. 
Rescue 6 Uninsured Goblin Workers.	Avoiding Lawsuits 101	Yo, George! I leave the A.M.O.D. for two seconds to deal with old Gallywix and now I'm knee-deep in Azerite goo! Listen, here's the deal. I need ya to rescue some of these goblins from these monsters. I'll be honest, I skimped on the money that covers their insurance in the event of Azerite-monster-related injuries. What? Who knew that these slimes would appear and attack these guys! Do me a solid and get these goblins outta there! 
Recover the Horde Missive from Captain Areiel.	Ending Areiel	The tortollans have given us Captain Areiel's location, as well as new information. She carries a missive from the Horde. Any missive the Horde would send to Areiel must be extremely important. We must recover it and deliver the information to Halford. Areiel and I once fought side by side. She's incredibly powerful, Keeshan and I will be there to help you bring her down. Good luck, George. 
Use the Rod of Tides to open the Path of Storms.	A Bridge Too Far	The bridge that once crossed this span is the only land route to the Shrine. It appears Lord Stormsong has sealed it to buy himself more time. We have been attempting to reopen the way to no avail. However, the Rod of Tides you recovered may prove our solace. Veteran tideguards use it as a key of sorts to maintain the Path of Storms across these dangerous waters. We will begin the ritual once more... if you will wield the rod. 
Convince the House Stormsong militia to clear the blockade.	Border Issues	They've closed off the entire valley! No wonder so many people have been complaining about trading with the Brennadam market. We have to do something about this. These people need to make a living! You're going to have to be an honorary cadet for me here, George. Tell these ruffians to clear the road! 
	Frenzied Knifefang	 
Kill 12 Mechagon forces in Junkwatt Depot.	My Father's Armies	My father was once a good leader. He envisioned a brighter future for his people, and did everything in his power to help us acquire it. But when his vision became misaligned with the dreams of his people, he failed to adapt. Instead, he grew rigid, forcing his will on others. In secret experiments, he began fully mechanizing the bodies of those who resisted him. It was horrible to watch... there was nothing left of the original gnomes who followed him willingly. Only robots remained. Slaves. 
Place Volatile Explosives on naga Harpoon Launchers, and then detonate them to create a distraction.	Explosions Always Work	The area surrounding Tidecaller Nezara is heavily guarded, so I'll need you to create a distraction. Take these explosives. Plant them on the naga's harpoon launchers. Once they've been detonated, the blast should be more than enough to send the guards running! 
Assist Alliance forces in Vol'dun.	Foothold: Vol'dun	The desert of Vol'dun has a promising harbor for our fleet. An indigenous snake people known as the sethrak occupy the area. They are aggressive and cannot be negotiated with. We have little choice but to eliminate them. - Magister Umbric 
Tear down 6 Irontide Recruiting Posters.	Recruiting Efforts	The captain of the Irontide Raiders, Harlan Sweete, has it in his tiny head that he's in charge of Freehold now. He's been forcing the smaller crews to pledge their loyalty, and littering the whole town with his damn recruiting posters. Do me a favor and take down any of them posters you find. Just don't let them catch ya doin' it, or it's a long walk off a short plank. 
Meet Lilian Voss at the Ashvane Foundry.	Explosives in the Foundry	I'm most interested in those explosives, though. Meet me in the foundry, east of here. You probably passed through it on your way from Plunder Harbor. 
	Supplies Needed: Blood-Stained Bone	 
Speak with Hobart Grapplehammer to dive to the ocean floor, then test your headlamp.	Deep Dive	We need you to retrieve Marshal M. Valentine's body at the ocean floor below. I should warn you: this part of the ocean is going to be very deep, and very dark, and very cold. Speak with Hobart at the starboard side of the ship. He's brought all the machinery you'll need to get to the ocean floor. 
	Azerite Wounds	 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Desert Survivors	 
Speak to Lieutenant Bauer at Seabreeze Village.	Bauer Backup	We've not heard anything from the coast since the Horde attack started. I need you to check in on Lieutenant Bauer at Seabreeze Village and see that they're safe. 
Stabilize the Unstable Magma then use the Magma Elemental to defeat 200 Bilgewater Goblins.	Fragment of the Firelands	The rumors o' yer capabilities seemed overblown, but it appears yer indeed a competent one, aren't ye? I underestimated ye, George. For that, I apologize. Don't tell Thaelin. The components for the ritual are now prepared. All ye need to do is add the Firelands Slag to the Unstable Magma an' a great bein' from the Firelands will heed our call. You'll gain control o' it and can eliminate the nearby goblin threat with nigh invincibility. 
Ride with Gonk to the Temple of the Prophet.	The Warpack	Zul began a coup, but he did not secure de pyramid for himself. Nor has he done anything to rally more to his banner outside of those who were already conspiring with him. Dis concerns me more than if he had carved his face into Dazar'alor itself. We must learn what he is up to. Join de disciples of Gonk and ride ahead to de Temple of the Prophet. Look to Wardruid Loti for further orders when you arrive. 
Go over the plan to weaken the Zandalari naval fleet with Halford.	How to Sink a Zandalari Battleship	Let's go over our plan of attack, but remember above all things, the Zandalari cannot know our full forces are here. If they were to discover an Alliance base within the shadow of their empire... we would be wiped out in an instant. 
Eliminate 10 Venture Co. Flame Starters and 2 Venture Co. Oilers.	Don't Play with Matches	These Venture Co. thugs set flame to the very oils they harvest. They hope to drive us from this land. Their plan has a flaw. If a great wave extinguished every torch, their oil could not be lit. You can be our great wave! Extinguish all the flames here, and we shall be victorious this day. 
Take the Runic Power Cores to Ulfar.	The High Thornspeaker	My teacher, Ulfar, the High Thornspeaker, must be informed of what's been going on here. I can't leave just yet. There are too many wounded and we'll need to handle the last few remaining constructs. You have proven trustworthy, friend. Take a few of these runic cores to Ulfar for me. Arthur will meet you at the head of the path to Ulfar's den. 
Kill Warlord Xiar, and light the signal fire.	Against the Tide	De mogu are growin' desperate. Ha! Maybe dey hope to get away from here before de fury of de loa rain down on dem! De warlord's pet sorcerer set up blockers and dey have taken de tower. If you can avoid the sting, de lightning rods can have ya feelin' pretty good. One could even say energized. Get to Warlord Xiar and relieve him of his life privileges. Then let our people know we have taken back de Breath of Pa'ku! Dis mojo is empowered to ignite de tower with a mighty blast. 
Assist Majo in choosing and mounting a horse.	The Perfect Horse, of Course	With all that you've collected for me... I guess it is time to mount, isn't it? Hoo! I haven't felt such nerves for three hundred years! Would you mind assisting me in finding a suitable equine partner? I could not trust myself to make the decision alone! 
Speak to Nedly.	Treasure Hunting	The workers are digging day and night out there to find the lost treasure. You'd get an equal share like everyone else, if ya wanna help out. Talk to Nedly about joining up. 
Slay 15 Alliance soldiers within the Blood Gate.	A Path of Blood	De main fleet of de Alliance and Kul Tirans are off de coast in Nazmir. But we cannot ignore de forces here. Dere seems to be a strange fog coming in from Nazmir. De Kul Tirans must be using some of their voodoo to weaken us. We must carve a path of blood through dese Alliance fools. Help our forces by weakening de Alliance. 
Kill 8 Veiled Deathstalkers.	No Survivors	Do you see the encampment on the beach below? The Horde followed Tyrande here. No doubt some of them have remained here in the shadows in case she returned. Kill them. 
Destroy 6 pirate Rum Stashes.	The Proof of Piracy	One thing pirates love more than gold is rum. So we're going to find their rum stashes and blow them up. With the rum all gone, a lot of the pirates should move on. Use my special barrel busting bombs to destroy the pirates' hidden rum stashes. 
Follow the trail of Eddie Norwington.	Following Eddie's Trail	My life is equestrian. I'm not a fighter. I could maybe take a trogg or two, but not a whole tribe. Please, go into Mistfall Cleft and see if you can find Eddie. Lord Norwington would be furious if something happened to him, and nobody wants to bear witness to that! 
Destroy 3 Skeleton Mounds with Da'jul's Fire Mojo.	Projection Destruction	Dis lich, Zardrax, be tryin' ta corrupt us ta join his side, George. I not be fallin' for it, and I know how ta be stoppin' it. He be gatherin' power from dem mounds of skeletons. We gotta burn 'em ta cut Zardrax off a some power. I be strong in da fire mojo. I can be impartin' some of me connection to da fire to ya ta burn dem mounds. I be stayin' here with Kal'dran. I tink Zardrax be gettin' ta him. 
Man the Vigil Hill Cannon and use it to slay 20 looters.	Hands Off My Booty!	We are dealing with lawless, no-account thugs. As soon as they gained ground, they started looting! Looting right in the middle of a battle! Well I, for one, am not giving up our booty that easily. Get up to the top of Vigil Hill and man the main cannon. Rain hellfire down on those blaggards! Dismissed! 
Ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and blow up the undead army.	The Re-Deather	I got the perfect plan. You're gonna ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and BLAST those walkin' cadavers from the sky! I hereby dub the Re-Sizer the ""Re-Deather."" We're gonna show them where the undead belong! Er, except for OUR undead. They're totally fine. Anyway, hop on the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and I'll pilot it. Once we save Shuja Grimaxe, we'll blast our way to all the other survivors! 
Speak to Baine Bloodhoof within Zuldazar.	Halting the Empire's Fall	Nazmir be havin' problem after problem, George. I not be knowin' how it can get much worse dan an Old God tryin' ta take over. I be makin' me way back ta Zul'jan ta lead our efforts ta keep Nazmir safe. Ya should return ta Zuldazar and let Baine know what be goin' on here. Maybe he be likin' dis here underrot, who knows? I can get ya outta here and back ta Zul'jan, if ya be needin' it. 
Ride with Princess Talanji and Rokhan to Zalamar.	We Have Them Cornered	General Rakera has already begun mobilizing our forces to our next target: Zalamar. Once we destroy de Alliance dere, we can push forward to de coast and destroy de source of dis fog. De Alliance will have nowhere to hide. We will surround their fleet and end dis war, once for all. Dey will wish dey never stepped foot in Nazmir. Come. We shall ride together to Zalamar and ensure our victory! 
Speak to Beastlord L'kala in Warbeast Kraal.	Side Effects May Include...	<Your direhorn companion hiccoughs repeatedly. Each time, it either shrinks or grows by a perceptible amount. It whines at you in distress. You could use some help.> 
Collect 20 Microcogs.	Upgraded	Well, look at you, Human...<Christy's mechanical eyes quickly scan your body.>Not as impressive as I had hoped. King Mechagon's armies are fully mechanized. But, you... you have a severe excess of flesh and matching machinery deficiency. Yes, we simply must make a few changes... Maybe a neural-cranial upgrade! Bring me a few microcogs from the motospiders nearby and I'll fix you up! 
Collect 8 Rugged Boar Tusks.	An Element of Danger	These nobles really think killing weasels is the mark of a good hunter? Ha! It ain't hunting if there isn't a bit of danger involved. There are boars in these woods. That's more our speed out in the mountains! Why don't you kill some of those, then bring me their tusks as proof? 
Use the rowboat in Talanji's Rebuke to travel to Xibala.	Xibala	George! How's things going over here? Oh. Wow. There's Horde soldiers everywhere. And Zandalari trolls. And hardly any machines at all. We should DEFINITELY head back to Xibala, with the dark iron dwarves. It's perfect for our foothold! 
Kill Director Deepwarden in Krakenbane Cove.	Eldritch Invocations	This is my fault, my friend. The leader of these cultists is none other than Director Deepwarden, a man who I once trusted as an advisor and business partner. It seems he did not approve of how I ran our operation... to a ludicrous degree. He gave his humanity for power, using his frustration to overthrow the village from the inside. Who knows what he plans next. I can no longer stand idly by. Take out Deepwarden. Show him that Anglepoint will not fall to his madness. 
Speak with Hanzabu in the courtyard of the Necropolis.	The Necropolis	A deal is a deal, and I pay my debts. Bwonsamdi is a mighty loa and you are going to need a powerful ritual to obtain his attention. You are in luck. I already know exactly what needs to be done. Bwonsamdi's temple, de Necropolis, is just to de north. Meet me in de courtyard and we shall see about obtaining an audience with de loa of death. 
Craft the Sapphronetta Flivvers Action Figure at Pascal-K1N6.	My Punkin, the Action Figure	Heya, George.<Grizzek leans in close and whispers.>I'm workin' on a surprise for Saffy. Hopin' you can help me out. I overheard her beggin' Jepetto Joybuzz to make her into one of his fancy new action figures. That ol' jerk told her no. Can you believe it? My Punkin! Well, we don't need him. I reverse engineered a few of his toys and found out what makes them tick. I got a blueprint ready to go. We can make Saffy's action figure ourselves and surprise her with it! 
Defeat the Ascendant Nightmare.	A Mote of Cosmic Truth	We stand on the brink, you and I. The final act looms over us, casting a terrible shadow. Deep we plumbed, seeking knowledge of the world. Deeper still we delved, until our fate was inevitable. Minds were shattered, my comrades ran screaming into the night. We are all lost, to that terrible Thing...Now, the malformed syzygy beckons. Complete the ritual and bring about the end. 
	Tempest-Speaker Shalan'ali	 
Protect Jaina Proudmoore.	Stand Fast	The Horde will pay for what it has done, but first I have to attend to the people here. George, I need to hold a portal open so the injured can evacuate to Boralus. Keep the Horde's forces off me while the wounded get to safety. We can deal with them once the civilians are safe. 
	Give 'Em Shell	 
Speak with King Rastakhan.	The Bargain is Struck	Now dat you have declared a patron loa for your time here in Zuldazar, you should inform de king of your decision. He will appreciate dat you chose to follow de great Pa'ku. 
Rescue Rokhan.	No One Left Behind	De warriors here tell me Rokhan made a heroic stand, holding off de Alliance and their champions before being defeated. Rokhan is still here within de Blood Gate, held captive by some strange creature called a Lightforged. I must stay here and help hold de line. I need you to rescue Rokhan! 
Deliver the Hundred Year Bourbon to Carentan in Freehold.	Aged to Perfection	Greetings, young one. I am Roko. I trade in specialty goods and exotic wares.<Roko pulls a small wooden cask from beneath his shell.>This bourbon is one hundred years old. I know, because I bought it one hundred years ago. A man in Freehold is prepared to trade me a rare scroll for this, but alas I am barred from entering. It seems this town is not so ""free"" anymore. If you can get in, perhaps you could make the trade on my behalf? I would be in your debt. 
Kill Trade Prince Gallywix.	We Have Him Cornered	Did you hear Gallywix barking orders to his servants and thugs? Still concerned with frivolities as we edge ever closer. He feels safe in his petulant palace of profits. He should not. Even here, we will strike down Trade Prince Gallywix. For the Alliance! 
	Champion Qalina, Spear of Ice	 
Use the Grease Trap to collect 12 Cog Grease from slimes around The Outflow.	Grease The Wheels	Kerchunk said you guys was working on getting that mechaspider running again. Well I'm not gonna let you have all the fun! That rusty old thing's gonna need a lot of grease to get moving again. So I jury-rigged a special Grease Trap to help you gather grease from the slimes nearby. 
Repel the Horde forces assaulting Drustvar.	A Drust Cause	Horde armies are pushing into the heart of Drustvar. Hold the line and drive them back to the holes they crawled out of. Kul Tiras is ours! 
	Arclight	 
	Sabertron	 
Rescue Pa'ku.	The Ancient One	Dis is far worse than I thought. Pa'ku is crying out in my mind. Dey are doing something to her. Something old and terrible, smelling of de old ways. She is nearby, just south of here. Come, $p, meet me at Pa'ku's roost and we'll rescue her. 
Use the Re-Sizer on 3 Wandering Boars.	Re-sizing the Situation	I call this gadget ""the Re-Sizer."" It's what I used to unshrink the Choppy Booster Mk. 5. Look, I'm gonna be honest. I got, at best, a passing understandin' of how this thing works. That means I'm gonna be pushing a lot of buttons to see what happens. I'm sure we'll figure out how to upsize one of these boars. Then we'll use it to trample those undead goons! You hold the Re-Sizer while I fiddle with it. Then just press the button and, uh... hope for the best? 
Defeat Lieutenant Cole.	With Honor	The Alliance and Kul Tiran forces are in disarray. I can hear the Azerite tank powering up. Lieutenant Cole intends to fight us... now that his forces are destroyed. Let me know when you are ready to fight. The three of us shall destroy this tank while our warriors watch on! 
Give promotions to a few of the Crushblow Peons at Peon Hideout.	Peon Promotions!	I agree with the plight of the peons. They should be rewarded for the work they do. It's unlikely that the Horde will agree to increase their wages, but there's no reason they can't be given a promotion. Any title other than peon would help build some confidence. 
Slay Hjalmar the Undying. You must use Execute in order to truly kill him.	Hjalmar's Final Execution	You now wield my most powerful skill, young warrior. Now use it to finish me! These ogres trapped my spirit here long ago for daring to defy them. Only through a glorious death will I finally be allowed to rest. It is the only way I will see my brothers and sisters in the afterlife. 
Return to Baine in the Royal Chambers.	King or Prey	My loa has seen fit to question my resolve. For my people, my pride, and my faith, we will correct dis. Return to your Horde. Ready your forces, and I will ready mine. When de time comes, we will strike back against de traitorous snake, Zul. 
Assist in the ceremony by the statue in Arom's Stand.	Everburning	My people have suffered loss and pain, struggling in the darkness that covered Drustvar. But now we have some light back. We have the means and the will to reclaim our lands from the lingering evils. Your help has brought much of that about. I will miss my parents. Though their end was dark, they were family. But my duty as the head of House Waycrest is clear. The dead can handle themselves. I must attend to the living and lead. There is a short ceremony I need to conduct. Would you assist me? 
Feed 6 Runaway Macaws.	Flew the Coop	Yes, yes, you can ride the pretties. They like it! They're good pretties. They like helping! Do you like helping, too? Maybe you can help me! Some of the loud men came here and threatened me. They don't scare me! But they made the pretties fly away. If you see any of my pretties out there, please feed this to them! It's my special treat. I know it will make them come home. 
	Herding Children	 
	Szun, Breaker of Slaves	 
Defeat the A.M.O.D.	The Mech of Death	We have reports of a goblin machine causing havoc among our troops up ahead. They call it the A.M.O.D. It is a crude machine compared to what the Lightforged have aboard the Vindicaar. Together, you and I will bring down this machine. Go, I will await for you near the machine and engage it when you are ready. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Rogue Azerite	 
Kill Chartusk in Foxhollow Woods.	Settle the Score	A year ago I lost my daughter to the largest boar in the forest. I have tracked him since, trading blows back and forth. But this time...Let's just say I don't have much time left. All I wish for is vengeance. Please Mechanic, avenge us so that my soul can leave this plane and join my daughter, wherever she may be. 
Drive back the Amathet Assault in Uldum.	Assault: Amathet Advance	The Amathet seek to claim the Forge of Origination for their own. We must not allow it to fall into their hands again! Our men are defending the entrance, but they will be overwhelmed if the entire might of the Amathet advances upon them. Do what you can to route their forces before its too late. 
Place an Idol of Rezan at Jamil's hut and persuade Rezan to retrieve Rastakhan's soul.	The Will of the Loa	Jol's remedy healed Rastakhan's flesh. But his spirit is still lost. Dere is only one thing stopping him now. Death. He is walking in Bwonsamdi's shadow. For most, dere would be nothing to be done. But... he is bound to another loa. A loa who gives life to his faithful. You must call on Rezan, loa of kings, and ask him to claim back Rastakhan's soul. Up de path, you will find my tent. Place dis idol and wait dere. If we are lucky, he will aid us. If not... It was nice knowing you. 
Meet with allies in the Cleft of Shadows in Orgrimmar.	Old Allies	Sylvanas Windrunner was once my ranger-general. Now she is my warchief. Through peacetime and war, I followed her orders. Until now. Baine is a noble soul. His execution would drive a blade into the very heart of the Horde. We must save him, George. It is the only way to preserve who we are. What we stand for. I have reached out to allies who will help you. But in siding with them, you will put your own life in peril. If you feel as I do, then meet them in the Cleft of Shadows. Good luck. 
Complete the Fall of the Sunwell scenario.	The Fall of the Sunwell	The flame of the lantern dims. Your final task is to rekindle it. In order to do so, you must walk one remaining path. While we are fortunate to hold the Sunwell once again, we must always remember that it was yet another part of us that Arthas took away... and that our late prince was forced to find us a new way of life. Enter the Sunwell Plateau, and witness its fall. 
Rescue Shoak from the Natha'vor trolls.	Shoak's on the Menu	I don't know what stupid thing Shoak did to get captured by the Natha'vor trolls, we'll find out once you rescue him. I bet they're getting ready to make a meal out of Shoak. You need to work fast and get him out! Shoak's one of the largest oafs that I know, those trolls won't be happy that you're taking their ""meal"" away. 
Collect 12 Ocean ""Infused"" Lagers.	Drunk Angry Murlocs	Those no-good Bloodfins ran off with all of the beer! I've been experimenting with brews that only use ingredients native to Nazjatar, but it's still a work in progress. For now, I must rely on whatever I can scrounge up from the shipwreck. My supply of beer was already limited, but now it's all gone thanks to those thieving Bloodfin murlocs! We're going to have some very angry customers here if we don't get it back. Please recover the stolen lager from Bloodfin Village before it's too late! 
Find Angus Ballaster at the Corlain Armory.	A Steady Ballast	The Armory presents us a ripe opportunity, Mechanic... one I suggest we take. If this battle were to draw out, we have little means to repair our arms and armor. A blacksmith is invaluable to any war effort, and Ballaster is one of our best. The Armory is but a short ride from here. I suggest you get to Ballaster before it's too late! 
Collect 10 Nazeshi Weaponry from forces within Dreadpearl Shallows.	We'll Use Their Weapons	We're going to need special weapons to take down Tidecaller Nezara. Good thing it looks like the naga have plenty. We'll use their weapons against them. You and I know a thing or two about that. Grab an assortment. We'll need more than one. 
Plant the Germinating Seed within Fertile Soil.	What Will It Grow?	<The small seed is starting to sprout. Perhaps there's a place nearby that it could be planted.> 
Administer the Antivenom to Serrik.	Effective Antivenom	The salve is ready. I work fast. Hopefully faster than the scorpid poison. Take this antivenom to your friend and see that he swallows every last drop. You should know within moments if it's been effective. 
Save 8 stranded battalion soldiers.	Reclaiming our Defenses	We were holding off the naga up until the latest attack. A few of our forces are still out there. The tidemaidens seem to be slowly torturing them to death. If you could save as many as you can find, we'd be one step closer to gaining the upper ground again. 
Deliver the Words of Zul to various individuals in the Port of Zandalar.	The Word of Zul	I have a mundane task for you. Our esteemed Prophet Zul has words to distribute to very specific individuals in de port. And he requested you be de one to deliver dem. Don't ask me why he didn't just have you deliver these when you were here de first time. De prophet is notorious for not sharing all of his visions. 
Enter the Temple of Sethraliss and heal the avatar of the loa.	Temple of Sethraliss: Avatar of the Loa	We cannot let Mythrax bring his destruction upon this world once more. We need our loa now more than ever, but she has yet to return to us. The time of her rebirth has passed. Someone, or something, must be preventing her awakening. Enter her resting place and see what you can uncover. 
Defeat Telaamon.	Telaamon's Purge	Telaamon, de Lightbringer leadin' dis assault, be in Hir'eek's cave. He must be thinkin' he can take us all by himself. When he is dead, we be sendin' dis assault force into chaos, allowin' us ta be marchin' on de Alliance along de shore. And hopefully, we can be findin' de source of de fog and destroyin' it. Da three of us be ambushin' Telaamon once ya start fightin'. He ain't gettin' outta here alive. 
Slay Zuvembi Brewer Zekal.	Zuvembi Brew	Zuvembi brew is arguably a witch doctor's most insidious concoction. Driven by de cauldron master's strength of mind, Zuvembi brew takes de will of those who breathe its fumes. It makes dem compliant, easily manipulated. It is low magic, relying upon ancient cantrips and recipes known only to witch doctors of a certain skill. If we want to eradicate dis brew, we must slay those dat brew it. Find de Zuvembi brewer lurking here and see dat dis knowledge is erased. 
	Supplies Needed: Frenzied Fangtooth	 
Collect 20 Mechanical Giblets and repair the OOX-Bomber/MG.	My Chickens are Not for Eating!	If you've spent any time with that arrogant nitwit, Overspark, you know why I'm here. To silence his boasting and finally prove that my inventions are better! I've released countless mechanical chickens across this island to analyze the technology here, adopt it, and evolve their own circuitry. One of them will become my ultimate battle chicken! But those idiot troggs think my chickens are edible and keep bashing them. Protect them, so my techno-evolutionary experiment can run its course. 
Brawl with Usha Eyegouge's forces on Mechagon.	Off-the-Books Brawlin'	*buuuurrp* Arrrright, listen 'ere. We got ourselves a bit o' a predicament. Besides this dump's ale tastin' like oil, that pigheaded Usha here been sayin' some unfortunate stuff about our troops. Unfortunate FOR HER, 'cuz now *uuuuurp* gonna needya ta rough up any Horde swine ya end up runnin' into out there. Loosely speakin' we ain't supposed to be brawlin' out 'ere, so this ain't a formal order or nothin'... 
Speak to Rokota and ride a pterrordax to Princess Talanji's camp in Nazmir.	Nazmir, the Forbidden Swamp	Da Horde promised Princess Talanji dat we be dealin' with dese blood trolls in Nazmir before dey can attack Zuldazar. Grab a pterrordax and get over ta Talanji's camp in Nazmir. We be waitin' for ya there. Make sure ya ready, George. Dere be no civilization in Nazmir, just us and whatever be lurkin' dere. 
Defeat Akunda the Exalted.	Ending the Madness	Akunda the Exalted is not who he seems. He poisoned the eternal spring, sickening all who drank from it. Even I was not immune to his abhorrent alchemy. Now he drains my power, abusing my gift to wipe the minds of all who might try to stop him. We will not let him succeed. What little power I have left, I will lend to you. Use it to call the storm and end the madness that has taken over my temple. 
Slay First Mate Trixie Tornsail.	Trixie Business	Usually this is the part where I hand you the scroll and send you on your way. Sadly, friend, these are unusual times. How's a man expected to run an honest business dealing in highly illegal goods when the Irontide Raiders are shaking down good folk like myself? I'm prepared to offer you a handsome sum - and the scroll for our shelled associate - if you rid me of the damnable woman who collects these tributes. You'll surely find her at Harlan's table at the bar, getting drunk on MY gold! 
Use Vorrik's Bulwark to defeat 75 Faithless within the Sacred Sands.	Infuriating the Emperor	It seems I underestimated Korthek's cowardice. I expected him to be behind the barrier, ready to ambush us. Yet, still he hides. That allows us a few moments to prepare. We musn't waste them. While I siphon power off of these immense crystals, you must thin the numbers of the Faithless here. I will grant you a powerful boon to speed you in your task. When Korthek arrives, he will require our full attention. 
	Pitch Black Scourgestones	 
Survive Jani's prank on the Amaki trolls. If you lose your saurid disguise, return to Jani for another.	Taking the Loa Road	This road not be traveled much anymore. Except by those that serve the blood Loa. They be fools. I be wantin' my fun from those fools. Go to the spot I be markin' for you and plant this cursed coin. The silly blood trolls be seein' it and give us a laugh when they try to pick it up. Just be makin' sure that no other creature see you. Or else it be a quick trip back to the arms of Jani. 
Contribute Spare Parts and Energy Cells to the Broken Drill Rig construction project.	Drill Rig Construction	<Prince Erazmin sifts through the resources you both collected.>Yes... This appears to be sufficient material to repair that drill rig. I'll do what I can with the parts that I have, but you will need to complete the repairs with yours. When you're ready, return to that broken drill rig we found and open it up. Together, we'll have it up and running in no time. 
Rally 12 Rastari Defenders.	No Troll Left Behind	Dis is de primary port for de Zandalari fleet. Thankfully most of our ships were out when de mogu came, but Rastari is still an active fortification for de city. De mogu did not land on abandoned shores, Mechanic. Dere are all manner of brave warriors stationed here, fighting for their lives. Take dis whistle and rally all you can. Our warriors will hear its scream and know dat dey are not alone. 
Find and kill Sandscout Vesarik.	WANTED: Sandscout Vesarik	To any and all who wish to see the Faithless empire fall: Sandscout Vesarik was spotted patrolling the dunes to the east. Gather a formidable force and strike him down! Those who succeed will be granted a fitting reward. 
Look for a shipwreck somewhere to the east, apparently.	Seafloor Shipwreck	<static>... look for shipwreck ...<static>... east ...<static> 
Observe Sylvanas's discussion with Princess Talanji.	The Return of Derek Proudmoore	I'll admit, I did not think the Little Lion had it in him to kill King Rastakhan. Blood has been spilled, and vengeance must be had. Give me a moment to express my condolences, then come with me. We have more to do to win this war. 
Follow the trail of Varok Saurfang in Elwynn Forest.	On Track	Keep your head down. We do not want to be seen out here. Our spies keep watch over Stormwind day and night, and saw no signs of Saurfang. Nor did we notice any oddly-oversized carts or strange ships in the night, if that was what you were thinking. How then, did he make his escape? Let's look around. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Night Horrors	 
Rescue Krol'dra the Wise, Wok'grug the Clever, and Wag'shash the Bold.	Krag'wa's Chosen	Dis be a real mess, George. Da naga be drainin' da magic of Krag'wa's frogs ta feed demselves! Dere be three frogs, Krag'wa's champions, dat dey be torturin' as we speak. Take dis potion, it be returnin' da power of dem noble frogs. Dey deserve better dan bein' drained by dese snake bastards. I be stayin' here. Da naga got in some lucky hits on me. All me life, I wanted ta see Krag'wa, and I let meself get hurt by some naga! 
Search the Goldfield Farmstead for additional keepsakes.	A Reason to Stay	<You find a pocketwatch on the ground. It is dirty, but still works. It was taken care of well. Perhaps there are other objects that Goldfield wasn't able to grab before he had to hole up in his house. He might appreciate it if you brought them to him.> 
Speak with Tallis Skyheart.	Trouble at Greystone Keep	A friend of mine, a fellow military courier, had a job at Greystone Keep. The fort lies just outside of Boralus, so I would've expected him to be back by now. I have another job lined up, so could you go check out the fort for me? I'm probably just being paranoid. 
	The Lords of Water	 
Help collect baseline stats for Grong's speed, intelligence, and strength.	Bring the Base	We'll need to collect some baseline statistics before we use the Embiggifier. Grong will be asked to perform basic tasks pertaining to speed, intelligence, and strength. This will help us measure the increase once he's been embiggified. 
Find an intact Zeth'jir Channeling Rod.	Piercing the Shield	I've been talking with Rikal, and the tortollan says that our problem in the delta can probably be solved by turning the naga's magic back on them. A few of the sorceresses on the south coast have a channeling wand that we may be able to use to break the head priestesses' ritual channeling. Find one, and bring it back here. 
Speak to Conservator Olem and give him the good news.	A Return to Grace	<With the temple restored and its defenses back online, the Wellspring should be safe from the devourers. Conservator Olem will want to know what you've done here.> 
Acquire a Runecarver Memory, an Armor Rune Vessel suitable to your class, and two different Missives. These items can be obtained through crafting, or can be found on the Auction House.	The Final Pieces	The final components you'll need to acquire are... vessels... rune vessels! Armor to hold the might that will be imbued. And... powers? No... missives? Yes! Missives will allow your item to enhance your own personal strengths. But they cannot be the same. No, the two must offer different benefits. All of these can be obtained from souls with the correct crafting knowledge. And lastly, more of my memories. Memories of the runes, of the powers... of myself. 
Speak with Tal-Inara in Oribos.	Souls Entwined	I must confess, at first I thought Pelagos was making a horrible sacrifice. But now I see--he was giving the Shadowlands all the hope and compassion he holds in his heart. We should go and see him. Speak with Tal-Inara when you reach Oribos. I will meet you there, my friend. 
Meet with the Primus within Keeper's Respite to form a new plan of attack.	The Primus Returns	The Jailer has four of the five sigils required for what he is planning. He is a fool for allowing us to live. His desire to see us bend to his will shall be his undoing. All is not lost, if you are willing to put in the work. There is still something that can be done. Come. I will meet with the rest of your forces and formulate our next attack. 
Complete the Mezzonic Protolock.	Your First Mezzonic Protolock	In order to aid me in my research, you will need to decode various Progenitor cyphers like the Mezzonic Protolock. Now, I will show you what you need to do. 
Throw Water on E'rnee.	Can I Keep Him?	Oh, no. I have created havoc in this sacred place. Look. E'rnee has bonded with you. It pains me, but you would be a better caretaker for him than I have been. Once we resolve this, you should take him. Now we know, at least, that the Falls have the ability to change the size of creatures. Let us try it again. 
Win the game of wits by using emotes to correctly answer the Playful Trickster's riddles.	The Games We Play	Do not worry about me. We have a bigger problem. I heard their leader around here somewhere during the attack. I have been keeping watch from here but I have not been able to see them. They must be using some sort of glamour to hide themselves. I have yet to meet a spriggan who can resist a game. If you find one eager to play and can win, then perhaps you can learn something about their leader. 
Collect 150 Protoplasmic Thread in Zereth Mortis, while in War Mode.	A New Deal	Ah, Maw Walker! Opportunities abound now that you have found a way into Zereth Mortis. Let us discuss further business, yes? We have an interest in observing the potential this new pathway has provided. I trust you will procure what we require. Do not let anyone get in your way. If this is not agreeable, I am certain I can find someone else to solve both of our problems. 
Press buttons on the console in the Slumbering Vault.	Technical Difficulties	The console is going haywire! We have to fix it! Maybe these buttons do something? 
Retrieve 6 Chromatic Rosids near Dimensional Falls.	Look Who I Found!	Behold this magnificent creature! Siloh says we have no resources for another of my ""abnormal pets.""But we may be able to alter E'rnee so that I can keep him. Strange interactions occur between creatures and this environment. Perhaps we can make him smaller. I know a spot where we can conduct our research. There are flowers nearby called chromatic rosids that might trigger a reaction. Why don't you collect some on the way? 
Find Tahli near the Arrangement Index.	Finding Tahli	After eons of tranquility, the Maw's influence has brought sorrow to Zereth Mortis. One of our acolytes, Tahli, has found it particularly difficult to process recent events. She left some time ago and has not returned. Will you check on her? She was last seen heading toward the ruins that are buried under the sands. 
Study the Locus Arrangements and use the Locus Shift to reach the Ultimus Locus.	Match Made in Zereth Mortis	The cyphers are the key. Each one, a step along the path. You must find them all. Enter the inner chamber. The Prime Locus Arrangement awaits. The first step toward ascension. Toward the vessel. 
Travel to Provis Esper.	Lost Grace	The waters of the Wellspring no longer flow. The designs of the First Ones have never before failed us. The pilgrims are beginning to wonder... are the First Ones displeased? Certainly they may question, but MY faith remains steadfast. And as I expected, it seems the First Ones have sent us a solution. You, of course. Ancient research and texts indicate that the source of the wellspring is in an underground temple in Provis Esper. Go, I have faith that you will restore the Wellspring. 
Read the rune stones of the five houses, then honor them by performing the correct /emote at each stone.	Repeat After Me	The Primus placed guardians in the area around the Sepulcher to protect the knowledge within. Each embodied the virtues of one of the five houses. To gain entrance, you must prove yourself worthy by besting these protectors. Seek out the rune stones that represent the houses of Maldraxxus. Pay attention to the words inscribed on each stone, then pay deference each house's values. If you honor the stone, its protector will come forth. Defeat each of them. 
Speak with Tal-Inara in Oribos to travel to the Arbiter's Chamber.	Call of the Primus	Though we fought to stop the Jailer in the Sanctum of Domination, we failed. He enveloped Oribos in the Maw, struck down the Arbiter, and opened the way to Zereth Mortis. The time has come to follow him. Within the Arbiter's Chamber, we will forge our own path. Hurry, Maw Walker. The fate of the Shadowlands, and all the realms beyond, is at stake. 
Assist your allies in Zereth Mortis by completing World Quests, Daily Quests, looting treasures, and slaying rare creatures.	Patterns Within Patterns	We stand at the origin of the Shadowlands. We must not allow this place to become its undoing. Work with our new allies, George. Their assistance will be the difference between our success and the unmaking of all things. 
Obtain a Champion's Coin from Mordretha in the Theater of Pain.	Trading Favors: Theater of Pain	Grandmaster Vole runs the arena in Maldraxxus, where the champions of each of the houses compete for glory. Naturally, prizes are often awarded to the victors. Those of our kind do not often participate in such battles. To find such a prize for sale by one of us would be quite unusual indeed. I trust I need say no more? Let us keep this transaction between us, and I will be happy to part with some valuable goods. 
Complete the Fugueal Protolock.	Your First Fugueal Protolock	In order to aid my research you will need to decode various Progenitor cyphers like the Fugueal Protolock. This is a most difficult cypher, I will show you what you need to do. 
Meet with Tal-Galan outside of Scholar's Den.	Vault of Secrets	You've helped us regain a semblance of order, Maw Walker, but the outlook is dire. The Jailer's forces have launched an all-out assault upon the ruins of our vault at the outer reaches of Korthia. Clearly the Banished One seeks something of value inside. The vault's defenses activate when the structure is threatened, so getting inside won't be easy. But we must recover whatever the Jailer is seeking before his Mawsworn do. I've enlisted the aid of a necrolord who can help open the vault. 
Thwart the Jailer's efforts throughout Korthia and the Maw by completing Covenant Assaults, Daily Quests, looting treasures, slaying rare creatures, and defeating Tormentors of Torghast.	Shaping Fate	The Jailer's power and malevolence continue to grow. So must our resilience. Stand amongst your allies, George. Push back against the darkness that would consume us all. Together, we will yet prevail. May the Purpose guide your hand. 
Complete the Cantaric Protolock.	Your First Cantaric Protolock	Maw Walker, it appears that Pocopoc has learned the Cachial skill. This grants you access to the Caches of Creation. You will find several types of these caches all throughout Zereth Mortis. In order to aid me with my research, you will need to be able to decode various cyphers such as the Cantaric Protolock. Now, let me show you what you need to do to assist me. 
Locate what is causing the Conduction Remnants to react.	Glow and Behold	Look, George. The remnants are faintly glowing! They must be reacting to something in Pilgrim's Grace. Find out what is causing this reaction! 
Figure out where to use the Key of the Forgotten.	Prison of the Forgotten	I discovered an interesting item off the Warden you killed in the tower. Best not to ask how I know what you do and where you do it within the tower. Let's just say, I have my ways. But this key could lead to something interesting within Torghast. Or something horrible. Most likely horrible. You ought to explore a bit and see what it unlocks. 
Rescue 5 souls and retrieve 60 Stygia. Stronger enemies will have a higher chance to drop large amounts of Stygia. Use the Stygia to purchase a Cypher of Relocation from Ve'nari.	Rule 1: Have an Escape Plan	Many doomed souls suffer within the Maw. You must be careful if you do not wish to join them. Your Soulkeeper can hold a small number of souls until you return to your covenant. But that will be of little benefit if you do not survive this place yourself. There is a substance, stygia, that is found on some creatures within the Maw. The stronger the soul, the more stygia they have. Collect some of it for me and I can fashion it into many things you will find quite useful. 
Speak with Saezurah.	Restoration Project	Without an Arbiter, the very purpose of the Shadowlands has been compromised. Souls flood the Maw with no direction. As Saezurah noted, Zereth Mortis would ordinarily craft a new being to take the Arbiter's place. I suspect the Jailer's forces have disrupted the land to the point where this is no longer possible. It is time to take action ourselves, and bring stability again to the Shadowlands! Speak to Saezurah, and see where we must begin. 
Collect 1 Cervid Lattice and 3 Protoform Tools and bring them to the Servitor Interface in the Protoform Repository.	A New Architect	The architects prototype designs to fulfill the purposes of the First Ones. This archive contained many such designs. A number of design entries are lost or corrupted due to the Maw invasion. An untouched design lattice and tools are detected nearby. The mortal will retrieve them to begin the synthesis process. 
Charge and cleanse the Progenitor orb.	Forcing the Cycle	The forces of Zovaal have been spreading their malign influence into the natural life within Provis Fauna. With the rate of their corruption, attempting to cleanse them one by one would be ill advised. Instead, we can just return their energies into the systems of Zereth Mortis to be used to create new fauna. Use this orb, let it absorb their energy as they die, and then cleanse it once it has been charged. 
Escort Pocopoc to the Protoform Synthesis Forge.	Protoform Synthesis	<Pocopoc jumps around anxiously. When you completed your research into the basics of Dealic, it got very excited and it is urging you to follow it somewhere else in this realm.> 
	Automa Ops	 
Name the traitorous house and enact justice.	Enacting Immediate Justice	There are likely many in attendance who wish me harm. I trust you have done your job in determining which house has been working with Andrei? Once they are named, I trust you will enact immediate justice. 
Meet with the mysterious contact in Oribos.	The Al'ley Cat of Oribos	Ah, Maw Walker. I have a message. An individual has a proposition for you, specifically. I know nothing of the details, only that they asked you meet them towards the back of the Idyllia. 
Speak with Bolvar to discuss what to do with the sigil.	Untangling the Sigil	The Primus's sigil is bound together with the magic of memory. It reminds me of something you have encountered before. You made an ally of the Runecarver, that poor soul trapped in the bowels of Torghast. He took those memories you found and helped you forge them into weapons and armor. Perhaps he can separate the sigil from this tangle of memories. It's our best chance to secure the sigil. But the way will be perilous. 
Kill the Lord Chamberlain inside the Halls of Atonement.	Halls of Atonement: Your Absolution	The depravity outside of these halls is only a whisper of the true horrors being committed under the Lord Chamberlain's guidance inside the Halls of Atonement. If you truly wish to curb this corruption, you must dethrone the imposter that you installed here. Atone for your own mistake. Kill the Lord Chamberlain, so that we may begin to restore permanent order to this place. 
Locate 10 Enlightened Provisions from chests, nests, relics and other containers about Zereth Mortis.	You Supply the Effort	The gear I provide is made available by the blessings of the First Ones and the... efforts of many other travelers. Each of us needs to provide for those that will follow later. Collect what provisions you come across in your exploration of Zereth Mortis. Keep a sharp eye out--they may be hidden in mysterious places. Return them here to me. I will in turn provide them to future travelers. 
Travel to the Catalyst Gardens and use the Creation Catalyst.	The Catalyst Awakens	Adventurer, can you feel it? High above the Catalyst Gardens, the Creation Catalyst hums with new power. This power while change the world itself. You must harness it at once. 
Go to the Terminus Platform and use the Ilskahorn to summon the Wrath of Odyn.	Focusing the Eye	The combination of grief and rage you have harvested is sufficient for your needs. Most likely. If you insist on seeing this ill-advised endeavor through, use the horn at the Terminus Platform, where the River of Souls flows upward to Torghast. The energies there are most potent indeed. The presence of your golden allies should draw the Jailer's Eye. I only hope this does not prove to be the end of you. I hate to see an investment wasted. 
Investigate the Shield Conduits around Haven.	Security Check	I do not understand--these are my brethren! How can they be so careless, so unconcerned with both greedy cartels and the Mawsworn at their doorstep? Their protective technology is antiquated. It will not keep danger out. If I cannot persuade them to leave, I can at least ensure they are safe where they insist on staying. I do not want to lose my friends again. There should be four hidden conduits around the edge of the shield. Take this kit. It will allow you to inspect and repair them, if needed. 
Collect 2 Depleted Goliath Cores from Forsworn goliaths, 6 Tampered Anima Chargers from Forsworn centurions, and 5 Soul Mirror Shards from Forsworn kyrian.	Humble Gatherer	Before your soulbinds step foot in the coliseum, you must challenge your first opponent. There is a tradition to this, as with all things. You will need to gather specific items, then bring them back here to fashion armaments to help execute your challenge. In the case of your first challenge, you will find the materials throughout Bastion. Return to me once you have collected everything, then we will continue. 
Go to Haven and deliver the news that Saezurah seeks a new Arbiter.	Arbiter in the Making	Maw Walker, I ... I do not know what to say. I did not expect this. She speaks of preparations and a new Arbiter. We must tell our friends in Haven. 
Meet Ysera at the Heart of the Forest.	A Cry From the Heart	<The voice of Ysera emanates from the scroll as you read the words.>George,There is a matter of great importance which requires your help. Please meet me at the Heart of the Forest as soon as you can. 
	The Burrowed Bufonid	 
Deliver the item to Firim.	Kismetric Disc	<Firim could make use of this item> 
Acquire a reward from the Great Vault.	The Great Vault	""The Purpose."" Utter nonsense, of course. The attendants are so blinded by devotion that you could drop stewards on their heads and say the Purpose told you to do so, and they'd ramble on about it being a mysterious portent of some grand destiny. Kah-Toll is the most insufferable of all. I've been observing that vault for quite some time, and I assure you it has never opened for anyone. Of course, if someone COULD open it, I'd pay handsomely to know what's inside. 
Travel to Exile's Hollow to witness for yourself what is happening to Saezurah.	Something Wonderful	George, I am so glad you are here! Firim sent me to find you. It's the oracle, it... well... it's hard to describe. You should come see it for yourself. Hurry! 
Speak with Polemarch Adrestes in Oribos.	The First Move	While the covenants labor to defend the Shadowlands, the Jailer has not sat idle within Torghast. It seems he intends to set the next phase of his scheme into motion. Polemarch Adrestes has brought us disturbing news from Elysian Hold. He will recount what he witnessed once you arrive. Make haste. I fear that time grows short. 
Collect 10 Eidolic Fragments and 300 Minor Enigmet.	Materials of Creation	The large metal spheres that litter the landscape of Zereth Mortis are spent forges, discarded during the creation process. The spheres near the Forge of Afterlives contain trace amounts of materials unique to that location. I have modified my Forge-Tap to harvest those materials. Use it near the forges I have identified. The rare Eidolic Fragments have the greatest chance to be found on the largest of Progenitor Forges. 
Talk to the Enlightened around Haven.	Enlightened Exodus	Hello, my friend! An expedition of Cartel Al was sent in search of this place long ago, and was believed lost. I entered Zereth Mortis in hopes of saving my splintered cartel from the dangers of the Maw that have preceded me. At last, I have found my old friend! And yet, she refuses to return to safety. Perhaps others can be convinced. Will you try? 
Throw 5 Soulforged Cores into Soulforges in Zovaal's Cauldron in the Maw.	A Suitable Demise	Surviving in this miserable place has been difficult, but I must confess... sending a few Mawsworn to a suitable demise does bring me joy. The soulforgers in Zovaal's Cauldron are among the cruelest minions the Jailer employs. I find satisfaction in disposing of their cores in the very forges which they maintain. This of course has the added benefit of temporarily slowing down their arms production, if you require more sober justification for your actions. 
Find any surviving jiro and convince them to meet outside the cave.	Broken Circle	The jiro of Circle Olea work here. We make...<The jiro pauses for a moment.>They... make new lands and creatures for the Forge. Devourers attacked, but some jiro still survive. You must find them. Tell them to gather outside the cave to the north. I will clear the way. Do not tell them I sent you. They will not want to see me. 
Investigate the Cypher Console.	Cyphers of the First Ones	The way is not quite clear, but the first steps have been made. It seems the divine construct has taken more of a liking to you than to me. Now that it has given you the beginnings of understanding, see what else it wishes to show you. The results should be enlightening. 
Track down the missing spirits of Ardenweald.	Tracking a Wild God	Dis be a dark place, George. We gotta track down da spirit who be trapped here. Me tink me can pick up its trail... but dat be all dis ol' shadow hunter can do. If me be tryin' ta fight wit' ya, da threads dat be tyin' me ta Azeroth might break. Den I gonna be stuck here, too. C'mon. We best be moving. 
Complete the Chosen Champions World Quest, the Theater of Pain Dungeon, or the Plaguefall Dungeon in Maldraxxus.	Challenges in Maldraxxus	Maldraxxus is a land of conflict and strife. There is little better place than to test yourself against the might of the Shadowlands. There, you will find warriors that are bred on combat, honed by the sword and hammer, tested in arenas and battlegrounds. Crash into them like the felling of a great branch, let them see the might of Ardenweald is no less terrifying. 
Rescue 20 Souls from the Maw.	Return Lost Souls	Souls continue to pour into the Maw, circumventing the natural order of the Shadowlands. The Jailer denies these souls their rightful eternities. Only you, Maw Walker, can set things right. Return to the Maw and save all that you can. 
Find a shipping manifest belonging to Cartel So.	Things Best Kept Dark	The leader of Cartel So represents a grave danger to the Shadowlands, Maw Walker. Her name is So'leah. She seeks to assemble an artifact of the First Ones and use its power for selfish ends. Pieces of the relic are said to be hidden on your homeworld. Brokers have never before found our way there. But if So'leah does, then Azeroth too is imperiled. We must intercept her. There is cargo nearby marked for Cartel So. Perhaps the manifest will give us clues as to their leader's whereabouts. 
Obtain a Secret Never Spoken from Watcher Vesperbloom's records.	A Secret Never Spoken	The first reagent listed in the scroll is a secret never spoken. Well, that's easy. I know who has tons of secrets! Watcher Vesperbloom, our resident snoop. She keeps the Wild Hunt informed of any nefarious behavior that takes place in the forest. I know she'd be willing to give us a secret to save Qadarin's soul from dissolving in excruciating pain. I'll have Thiernax meet you wherever she's hidden them. It'll keep his mind off what's happening to his husband. 
Break the Runecarver free.	The Weak Link	This ought to be enough to break the bonds that hold your newfound ally.<Ve'nari pauses for a moment.>Before you do so, I offer a word of warning. No creature imprisoned in that place should be trusted. Tread carefully, mortal. After all, it would be a shame to lose so valuable a business partner. 
Protect the Winter Queen's sigil in the Battle of Ardenweald.	The Battle of Ardenweald	With the betrayal of Sire Denathrius, and the absence of the Primus of Maldraxxus, we must assume that the Winter Queen is the Jailer's next target. And we won't let anyone take her sigil! Ardenweald has endured much, but it is a realm of great and mysterious power. Things aren't always what they seem. We'll use this to our advantage, no matter who comes for the Queen! 
Speak to Uther the Lightbringer.	News from Oribos	I bear important news that will grant us insight into the Jailer's methods. With faith and understanding, we may also execute true justice. There is much we should discuss, Hero. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Mighty Minions of Maldraxxus	 
Retrieve a Colossal Power Core from Perdition Hold in The Maw. Suggested Players [3]	Power of the Colossus	I have another task for you, Maw Walker. Deep within Perdition Hold, there lurks a menacing mechanization known as the Soulsteel Colossus. It must be destroyed before it wreaks havoc upon us. Travel to the Hold, and then across the bridge into the Altar of Domination. There, casting its vast shadow upon The Maw, you will find the Soulsteel Colossus. Shatter the colossus and bring me its power source as proof of your victory. 
Restore the Translocator Key at the Creation Catalyst.	Key Crafting	With those agitated automa quelled, there is but one task ahead. We shall ferry you and your Enlightened companion up to the Creation Catalyst. The rest is up to you. 
Speak to Conservator Olem about the Wellspring's problem.	The Wellspring of the First Ones	A mortal, here? How unusual! Welcome to Pilgrim's Grace. Would that you had arrived under better circumstances. Pilgrims usually travel here to visit the sacred Wellspring of the First Ones. Unfortunately, the wellspring has gone dry. I do not understand it. The creations of the First Ones should be infallible! This situation is as unusual as your arrival--perhaps you can lend your aid? Travel to the wellspring and speak to Conservator Olem. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Maldraxxus with your trainee.	Training in Maldraxxus	The forces of Maldraxxus are some of the most highly trained and well-regimented in all of the Shadowlands. Once, they defended us all, now we must fend for ourselves. There is little better place for our trainees to gain real combat and strategy experience than on their blood-soaked battlefields. Take this one with you on your travels today, so that they may see what real combat looks like. 
Obtain Honor in Random Battlegrounds.	Observing Battle	It is clear that you mortals thrive on conflict. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action. You seem to be fond of squabbling over contested ground. Observing such territorial behavior would benefit me, and could provide opportunities for you as well. Can I count on your participation? 
Meet Rathan and Emeni at Sixfold Recluse.	Rebellious Souls	Please hear us out, Maw Walker. When Margrave Gharmal launched his attack on Bastion, there were many, such as Emeni and myself, that opposed his actions. Fearing dissent, Gharmal removed many souls from their constructed bodies and imprisoned them. Emeni escaped the prison, but most did not. Help us free the other souls, and we can build you an army of constructs far greater than any that serve Gharmal. 
Obtain Honor in Rated Battlegrounds.	Observing Teamwork	It's truly fascinating how conflict drives your kind, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action. I am told that some of your most impressive martial demonstrations involve combat between predetermined teams. My people are unfamiliar with such contests. Would you be willing to offer a demonstration? 
Pick up the Protoform Catalyst and return it to the Protoform Repository.	The Lost Component	Maw Walker! Look. We have been studying this automa component for some time. Its cyphers are similar to those of the components near and within the Protoform Repository. Kodah's last effort should not be in vain. Please return this component to the repository that our friend restored. 
Complete the Destroy the Dominant World Quest, the Sanguine Depths Dungeon, or the Halls of Atonement Dungeon in Revendreth.	Challenges in Revendreth	I've never really trusted the Venthyr of Revendreth. Maybe it's those long coats they wear, or maybe it's those pointy teeth, but something about them creeps me out. Their leader, Denathrius, has sided with the Jailer against the rest of us, so I guess I was right. I want you to find his most powerful allies in Revendreth and smash them to a bloody pulp. Send him a message from Maldraxxus. 
Enter Tazavesh and defeat So'leah.	Tazavesh: Raiders of the Lost Artifact	It looks like you may need to show a bit of force once more, my dear friend. Tazavesh security will not let us simply walk in. But So'leah needs to be stopped. If that requires a bit of physical... persuasion... then it is a necessary evil. Bring some friends. I have a feeling the security here has tricks up their sleeves. 
Meet Kleia at the Court of Elation.	Trial of Ascension	The Forsworn threat is ever looming, and our forces are dwindling. Now, more than ever, we need more Ascended. Our generous Archon has blessed us with a portion of our anima stores to ascend our top aspirants to join our forces. Kleia is amongst the chosen, and thus must complete her final trial. As Pelagos is not yet prepared to ascend, I request you be Kleia's partner for this process. It is arduous and should not be embarked on alone. She must bear her first soul. 
Speak to the Fearstalker in Wanecrypt Hill and participate in the Penitent Hunt.	The Penitent Hunt	You will descend upon these poor souls. Remember, you are helping them and Revendreth through the terror you bring. When a soul is filled with fear, their resistances to our methods falter. The Master has requested that you hunt the Accuser yourself. But we must prey upon some of the others first. I will be able to guide you through your first hunt. 
Defend the jiro from devourers until they enact the dampening field.	Jiro to Hero	I have spoken to other jiro. Our orb can create a dampening field. It should close the rifts and stop new ones from forming. It must be done where the Maw magic is strongest. Between the giant chains. The power released by the orb will draw devourers. You and I must defend the orb until the field is set. I will escort the others. Meet us at the rift when you are ready. 
Kill Famos in the Eternal Forge and collect Mikanikos's Toolchest.	No Friend of Mine	Tools. I cannot work without my tools! Famos, my former apprentice, stole them all when she went to the Forsworn. It breaks my heart. She had so much promise. She must be stopped. 
Reclaim the Remnant of Justice from the Ossuary of the Banished in Torghast.	A Paladin's Soul	Bolvar Fordragon has seen visions of a vault hidden deep within Torghast where the Jailer keeps souls he deems valuable. Uther was struck down by a mourneblade. When such a weapon is wielded with rage, it can shatter a soul into fragments. If the Jailer holds a part of Uther's soul, it cannot be fully mended until the lost piece is restored. Take this attuned shard to Torghast, $p. It should guide you to the vault's location. Find the lost fragment of Uther's soul so that he can be made whole. 
Rally the covenant forces to go into the Maw.	Charge of the Covenants	Thanks to the efforts of you and other heroes of Azeroth, the covenants have grown strong. But we can no longer afford to wait for the Jailer to make his next move. The way to the Maw is open. Our forces stand ready. The covenants await your signal, George. 
	Mortanis	 
Subjugate the Abused Soul.	An Abuse of Power	The souls have suffered tremendously under the Lord Chamberlain. We venthyr subjugate souls to our will so that we may lead each to the absolution it requires--willing or not. The Lord Chamberlain, however, has been using our relics and rituals to abuse the souls under his authority. He binds the souls to their sinstones, perverting their very essence! Use these ritual chains on the abused soul and subjugate it to your will. We must attempt to absolve it. 
Use the enlightened broker device to remove the progenitor debris from vespoid nests.	Bzzzzt!	The vespoids of the region use debris in the area to form the core of their nests. While this is normally something we'd allow them to naturally do, they've started taking some of the relics we were studying. I have a device that should hopefully allow for the removal of such relics from their hives without damaging the core structure. Use it to retrieve these relics. 
Meet Flutterby at the Forge of Bonds.	The Forge of Bonds	To best serve the court and the forest, you must bond with another fae. It is an ancient ritual, one which will grant you great strength to face the many trials ahead. Flutterby below will guide you further. 
Speak with Vilo at Haven in Zereth Mortis.	Supplies from The Enlightened	Ah, yes. How I've looked forward to this moment for quite some time! Come, visit me. Let us share this achievement together. I've prepared something special just for you. 
Use the Automa Hand to activate an Automa Console and obtain the Repository Treasure.	A Mutual Exchange	It seems the other automa did not appreciate our appropriation of their colleague's hand. They have become hostile. Unfortunate, but we cannot allow this to impede our progress. The automa's hand should activate a console within the Genesis Repository. I believe it holds an object of great potential. After you acquire it, I will guide you to a place that may provide a means to reach the allies you left behind. Do we have an accord? 
	Flight School: Falling With Style	 
Defend Maldraxxus by completing Daily Quests and World Quests, looting treasures, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in the Plaguefall and Theater of Pain dungeons.	A Call to Maldraxxus	The forces of Maldraxxus have long defended the Shadowlands from threats outside of our lands. Now, they face their greatest threats from within. The balance of power between the houses is broken. It has led them to assault us, and others. Their problems are many, our solutions are just. Travel to Maldraxxus and slay those that would do the Shadowlands harm, providing shelter to your allies when you find them. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Airborne Defense Force	 
	Soul Well	 
Use Primrose's Pyrotechnic Powder to destroy 5 Ritual Altars.	Break It Down	I've seen the ritual. It's... terrifying. But the altars seem to be the key. If only I had my pyrotechnic powder, I could blast them to bits!<Primrose is silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath.>If you could get the powder and guard me, we could blow up those altars. I stashed as much as I could in our dwellings. They don't seem to care any more. You don't have wings, but a pinch of faerie dust should work for a short time. Let's do this before I change my mind! 
Search for Kivarr at Eventide Grove in Ardenweald.	Searching the Grove	It is clear that a struggle took place here. I fear that Kivarr may have been taken by the Drust. I scouted the surrounding area before you arrived. Eventide Grove has been overrun. The Drust cannot have taken her far. We may yet be able to find her. I just pray that we are not too late... 
Find a way to restore Locrian Esper.	Restore the Flow	Look! Devourers have penetrated the temple's defenses. Those ravenous menaces feed on any energy that they can find. They must have been drawn to the wellspring's power. With that kind of interference, no wonder the waters have been stalled! The solution must be inside Locrian Esper. Once there, see if you can find a way to reverse the damage that has been done. 
Help Keeper Ta'saran replenish stock by retrieving the items on the list he's provided you.	Ember Court: Mortal Reminders	For a reasonable renumeration, Ta Cartel can supply the decorations you require. Restocking unique and intriguing items is an important aspect of doing business. As you can freely return to your own world, you can provide me some new and exciting products to offer. Your world has captured the imagination of many of our clients. I have buyers looking for some specific things native to Azeroth. 
Go through the mirror, then collect the Countess's Sinstone.	Through Glass	The mirror frame rests at the bottom of Redelav Hall. Kleia and Pelagos wait there. With these shards, I can piece it together. We will go through, grab the sinstone, and go face the Countess. Let nothing stand in our way. 
Slay the variety of slimes to fill the tanks with fluid.	Filling the Tanks	<The containment pack appears to be intact, albeit empty. Perhaps refilling it with the appropriate mixture of liquids will render it functional once more. Slaying the correct combination of slimes should provide all the fluid necessary.> 
	Frog'it	 
Visit the Untamed Verdure with Glimmercane.	Mysterious Greenery	There's a bright power emanating from the place above. I'm drawn towards it, like a moth to a light! I want to check it out, whatever it is. Won't you join me, please? It'll be so fun! 
Purchase an Anima Supricifer from Ve'nari and recover 5 Molten Anima.	A Grave Chance	First you'll need a vessel to house anima and a way to expel it. I happen to possess such a device, which I'll be pleased to give to you. For a price, of course. You recall Zovaal's Cauldron, I trust? The denizens there were forged in unholy fire. Assuming their anima is of a similar nature, it should be able to melt even the metals of the tower. With my device and their anima, I believe you can achieve your goal, Maw Walker. 
Gather the Ingress Phrases on the Ultimus Locus that are needed to claim the Vessel.	Searching High and Low	Three locks upon the door, three keys hidden atop the zenith. Find the phrases. Speak the words. Secure the vessel. 
Disarm 6 trapped tools.	The Sweat of Our Brow	Ah, an outsider! You are perfect for this task. The spriggans are known for their mischief. They have been cursing our tools and supplies and trapping unsuspecting workers! Like our curses, they must obey the rules. You'll need shimmerdust for baskets, thread made of gossamer for harps, and minty fresh breath for the soulwebs. How odd. Good luck and let the Lady of the Falls know when you're done. She'll be delighted to hear it! 
Place the Progenitor Magic Sensors in the Catalyst Gardens.	Obvious Plant	The situation in the Catalyst Gardens is troubling. But most troubling of all is that we do not know more. If we had an understanding of the changing levels of energy emitted by the Creation Catalyst, we could make better decisions as to how to proceed. Take these sensors. Place them below the catalyst at the locations marked upon your map. 
Drink Feroz's solution and destroy the automa of the Catalyst Gardens.	Flora Frenzy	Those guardian automa will shoot down anything that attempts to reach the Creation Catalyst. May I suggest fighting fire with fire? Or rather, fighting the creations of the First Ones with the creation energy of the First Ones? I have had little time to adequately test my theory, but this potion should provide the boost you need to destroy them... ideally without dying from exposure to the creation energy in the process. 
Enter Plaguefall and recover 12 Poxedskin Samples and Margrave Stradama's Plasm.	Plaguefall: Knee Deep In It	There are many in the House of Plagues who survived its destruction only to later fall victim to the plagues released in the explosion. Margrave Stradama herself was driven mad from a mixture of twelve different airborne poxes! These dangers still remain and spread out from the ruins, infecting new victims daily. I need you to travel into the ruins and recover samples from the victims there. 
Observe Kowalskos' test flight.	Glimmerflight	This so exciting! Come, another test is in order. I can hardly wait! 
	Things Remembered	 
Investigate the offers of the Brokers to see whether a remnant of Aliothe's world may be found.	RSVP: Droman Aliothe	I serve my Queen and abide by my oath to guard this hollow and tend the spirits it encloses. Once, I might have enjoyed your Prince's party, but I am no longer suited to revelry. My world was destroyed long ago, and perhaps I have lost the joy I felt as its wild guardian. I would dearly like a reminder of my old home. I have heard those strange traders, the brokers, have unusual objects from other worlds. Perhaps they have something from mine? 
Defeat any inquisitor in Halls of Atonement. Archivist Fane can provide Inquisitor Sinstones to help you in your hunt.	Stop the Inquisition	The Lord Chamberlain's inquisitors still torment the poor souls trapped under their care. You must put a stop to their wicked deeds! Speak with Archivist Fane, whom you worked with before to defeat an inquisitor, to acquire the sinstone of another inquisitor in the halls. With their sinstone, you will be able to shatter that inquisitor's defenses and lead the charge to defeat them. Bring friends, $p. Many of the inquisitors are far too dangerous to approach alone. 
	The Patient Bufonid	Look, another magnificent creature of Zereth Mortis! By the glint in its eye, I would say it was playing along the whole time. Patience delights. Bud is pleased. Excellent work, Maw Walker. 
	Trouble at the Gormling Corral	 
12 Prying Eye's research data collected.	Portal Play	To aid in my studies, I have used a network of travel portals to install monitoring devices all over Zereth Mortis. My devices have been quite successful at collecting large amounts of research data. It's time now to collect the data they have obtained. Use my portal network to locate my Prying Eyes and collect any data they have gathered. I'll give you a portal initiator as well, allowing you to re-enter the portal network, incase you find yourself lost! 
Experiment with waterfall water in Dimensional Falls.	Cascades of Magnitude	Many of the creatures here at Dimensional Falls are particularly affected by the environment. Hmm... let us experiment with the waterfalls themselves! We have seen unique effects from various natural components here in Zereth Mortis. Why not the water as well? Collect some water, then sprinkle it on a creature in the Falls to see what happens. 
Find a stolen memory of the Runecarver.	Reawakening	If you can retrieve my memories, I can help you. At least I believe I can. Then, perhaps, we can help each other. 
Speak to Anduin Wrynn in the Geometric Cavern.	The Broken Crown	Our friends have returned from the Sepulcher of the First Ones with a familiar face. Anduin... What terrible things he has endured. But as difficult and painful as it is, we must uncover what he knows. The Jailer has blocked our way within the Sepulcher, and we risk falling victim to Domination ourselves if we blindly follow. He is our best hope. 
	Mor'geth	 
	It's Race Day in the Ramparts!	 
Kill Mawsworn Troops within Perdition Hold in The Maw. Suggested Players [3]	Forces of Perdition	Survival requires that we keep our enemies in check, Maw Walker. With Gorgoa overflowing, the Mawsworn continue to gain strength. Perdition Hold has been fortified with fresh troops. We cannot allow the Mawsworn to bolster their ranks any further. Make your way into Perdition Hold and decimate their forces. When the work is done, you may return to me for your reward. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Natural Defenders	 
Open the Waystone to Oribos.	This Old Waystone	The Jailer has withdrawn his forces. I should be relieved, but I fear this means he has found a way into the Sepulcher.<Elder Ara trembles.>Despite Elder Kreth's doubts, you have proven to be an ally. Something we need more of. When our expedition arrived in Zereth Mortis, we discovered a dormant waystone. If you are indeed a Maw Walker, then the prophecies tell us that you will be able to activate it. If your allies can save this sacred place, then the path to them must be opened. Come. 
Complete 3 Daily Quests from Mikanikos, Ta'nasi, and Kael'thas throughout Korthia.	In Need of Assistance	The inhabitants of Korthia have been through much. Were it not for our arrival, the Jailer's forces would have rampaged through the remainder of the City of Secrets, leaving destruction in their wake. To continue our efforts, we must assist those in need. Heed the call of our allies, Maw Walker. See to it no stone is left unturned and no ally of the Jailer left alive. 
Speak with Ta'nla the Identifier at the Night Market.	Seeking Smugglers	We brokers have found that it is in our best interests to remain mobile. And discreet. A number of our cities and outposts are tucked away in the In-Between, capable of moving from place to place. Much to my chagrin, it seems I have lost track of Tazavesh. I believe our best course of action is to ask Cartel Ta for access. They pride themselves on keeping track of such things. Let's try our luck with those at the Night Market in Revendreth. They may be more forthcoming than their Oribos kin. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Failed Experiment	 
""Sootible"" hats may be crafted by players who have the recipe and appropriate tradeskill.	RSVP: Rendle and Cudgelface	I heard about the prince wanting Rendle and me at 'is court. I aim to please 'im an all, but Rendle says 'e haven't got proper ah-tire. Says 'e needs a sootible hat, maybe somethin' posh that hints at 'is inner depths. He says the only good hats are: Red Noggin Candle, or one a them Fae Revel Masques. Or mebbe a Pink Party Hat, or a fancy Crown o' the Righteous. 
Enter the new portal in the Torghast Lobby.	The Jailer's Gauntlet	Maw Walker! I have been looking for you. Word is there is a new gathering of the Jailer's forces in Torghast. I'm not sure what they are doing, but it can't be good. Perhaps you should put an end to their plans? 
	Mirror, Mirror...	We have what we need to get you through, George. My medallion lies on the other side of the mirror. Once through, my medallion will be there... somewhere. Please be careful. My mind may be weakened, but I do remember working with the Accuser to protect the crypt's interior. I should be able to tell you everything about this place, but I am afraid that just is not the case anymore. 
	Tough Crowd	 
	Bad Samples	 
Collect anima sources for the Anima Reservoir at Elysian Hold in Bastion.	Replenish the Reservoir	Hail, Maw Walker. As our influence over Bastion grows, so too does our need for our most precious resource--anima. We must replenish our reserves. Scour the realms for all that you can find and return here with the anima. With our precious reserves replenished, we can direct the anima wherever it is needed most. Go in service, Mechanic. 
Obtain Honor in Arenas.	Observing Arenas	The denizens of your world seem to thrive on conflict, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action. Small-scale encounters in a constrained setting could prove informative for me, and potentially lucrative for you. What do you say? 
Meet Firim in Exile's Hollow.	A Monumental Discovery	Maw Walker--Pelagos stopped by earlier to give a report and said that the oracle's preparations were complete, and you were urgently needed. If this is something that can help our efforts, I want you involved. Head to Exile's Hollow and see what they need. 
Meet with Pelodis and Nemea, then pick a side.	Pride or Unit	You have made great strides with our pride. I hope you found value and fulfillment in working with the larion. The time to meet with Pelodis has come. You must decide whose way of life is more rewarding, and which you would prefer to pursue. 
Meet Highlord Bolvar inside the Chamber of First Reflection in Bastion.	Where the Memory Resides	I think I know what will be asked of us in Bastion. It will not be easy. With this half of the Helm, we have collected the first part of what is needed to resist Domination. But there are those of us who have also suffered from it. Lived through it. In a way, it has marked us. All of us. There must be something in those experiences that will help us break free from Zovaal's influence. Let us go to the Chamber of First Reflection in Bastion. 
Complete 1 quests in Perdition Hold and the Face of Oblivion.	Kyrian Assault	The Jailer's forces have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination! Your help is needed Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield! 
	Valinor, the Light of Eons	 
Deposit Anima into your sanctum's Reservoir.	Into the Reservoir	With anima in short supply these days, I've been entrusted to manage the reserves 'till they be needed. Go 'ead and deposit any anima you collect into the reservoir 'ere. Be assured, It'll be safe an' secure in me care. 
Collect 20 rune chits, then bring them to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Diviner's Rune Chits	<Inside the pouch is a single rune chit. It rotates and flips as if moved by an unseen hand. Runes vaguely reminiscent of the Vrykul language are delicately carved into the stone. On the back of the chit is an indication that it is part of a set.> 
Return to the overlook behind Pilgrim's Grace.	The Pilgrimage Ends	You have rescued many pilgrims, and I have restored your entrance to the Sepulcher. With that, our bargain is concluded--and so, too, is my pilgrimage. But your journey continues. Return to the overlook behind Pilgrim's Grace and open the translocator. My thanks, George. This adventure has been... enlightening. 
Enter Torghast and search for Baine.	The Search for Baine	I dare not step inside that accursed tower myself, of course. While I cannot tell you exactly where your comrade is being held, I offer a gift to assist you. Use it inside Torghast. It should take you somewhere near your missing ally. Baine Bloodhoof was his name, yes? Either that, or you'll end up trapped within the tower's ever-shifting halls for all eternity. But those are the risks one must take, I suppose. Best of luck! 
Retrieve the Prototype Aquilon.	Dead Drop	Ta'nla requested something very... specific... on behalf of a client. The kyrian have been working on a new type of centurion they call an aquilon. I sent some of our trade specialists to retrieve the prototype in question, but they have yet to return. Until I have the item, there is obviously no way I can ship it to Ta'nla. Perhaps we can help one another. If you can locate the aquilon and bring it here, I will help you reach Tazavesh. 
Deliver Gertie Jr. to Lillythistle.	Thread of Hope	<Gertie Jr. looks up at you with hope. Perhaps you can help get her to safety.> 
Speak with representatives from the Enlightened, Venthyr, Necrolord, and Night Fae.	Help From Beyond	If we stand any chance of breaking through the Mawsworn forces, we will need the help of all of the covenants. I will speak with the Kyrian. You and Pelagos can speak with the others. But before you go, ask Firim if there is any way we can gain the support of the Enlightened as well. 
Find and Catch Renny the Vulpin kit.	That Darn Fox!	You! You there! I, Clarion Song, need your assistance. Yes, yes, give yourself a moment to bask in my glory.<Clarion Song gives you a moment.>Done? Good. I need you to catch a troublesome vulpin kit. He is positively barbaric! Running amok, causing havoc, ruining my beauty rest! He's using a concealing charm to make himself invisible, but I know it's him! Make yourself useful and catch that kit! 
Discover a way to break the Runecarver free from his chains.	A Damned Pact	Yes... I begin to remember. Power. Power with a purpose. That is what I can offer. Runes. Runes are the key. I've recalled some of them, but to infuse them into your equipment, I require my hands. Well, one hand would suffice. Both would be better. Find a way to free me from my bonds, mortal. Then I can offer the power you seek. After that, freedom... and perhaps the downfall of the one who bound me. 
Obtain the Eye of the Scryer from Leerok the Scryer in The Maw.	Eye of the Scryer	Evading the Mawsworn's scryers requires powerful magical countermeasures. The prime reagent? A luminescent eye, pried from the skull of a scryer recently shaken from its trance. The scrying ritual begins as we speak. You will, of course, be compensated only for an intact eye. Restraint is advised in its procurement. 
	A Steward for Every Occasion	 
Rescue Archivist Roh-Senara.	Interrupt the Interrogations	Shhh... quietly! The invaders will kill me if they find me here, just as they have killed so many others!<Roh-Suir points frantically in the direction of the Mawsworn.>They're torturing the Archivist! You must find a way to rescue her. We cannot allow the Mawsworn to learn all that she knows! 
Find the Mawsworn presence at the Circle of Thought.	Doppelganger Duel	Something about this doesn't sit right with me. From what you reported, this seems like intentional sabotage from within our ranks... or the work of more dreadlords. If dreadlords are involved, then the obelisk may be at risk! Get to it--if we linger on this it may be too late! 
Lift 4 Mawsteel Shards and throw them off the cliffs.	Mawsteel, Maw Problems	Zereth Mortis is sacred. Rifts should not form here. Something creates them. The metal you found has Maw magic. Devourers use it to make rifts. This is how they skirt our protections. Mawsteel shards are strewn across the area. Take these shards. Throw them off our cliffs. Make sure devourers do not use them to create rifts. 
Obtain Honor in Epic Battlegrounds.	Observing War	Your appetite for conflict is a subject of much discussion here in Oribos, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action. Though I understand a great war recently concluded on your world, I am told large-scale conflicts continue to play out in certain locations. Any chance you could arrange a demonstration? 
Complete 3 World Quests in Revendreth with your trainee.	Training in Revendreth	A trainee is in need of your guiding hand. Take them to Revendreth, where you will find the armies of Denathrius thirsting for our demise. Wade in to battle with them against our mighty foes. Return victorious, as their shield and mentor, so that our armies will be bolstered this day. 
Speak to Elder Amir in Pilgrim's Grace.	Judgment Call	Oh no... No no no... What have I done? The elders will never take me back. They shall cast me out as they did Firim. Please, outsider, speak to Elder Amir in Pilgrim's Grace. Give him my thanks for sending you, and tell him all that has happened here. He will understand why I must never return. 
Recover Korthian Repositories from the Korthia Rift for Archivist Roh-Suir.	Lost Research	We have uncovered a promising source of Korthian research. Previous Archivists hid knowledge within repositories that were then placed within the rift. I fear that the repositories are no longer safe and that shades of that realm will consume them. It is imperative that we secure this research before it is lost forever. Use a Repaired Riftkey to enter the Korthia Rift. Recover the Korthian Repositories. 
Deliver three Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil to the Pool of Potions.	Pool of Potions	I shall teach you about the Pool of Potions. The potions we create here have a variety of beneficial effects. Kill the slimes in the surrounding ruins and collect the Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil they may drop. Each slime can produce a great quantity of oil, so you'll only be able to carry one slime's worth at a time. Deliver this oil to the Pool of Potions and toss it in. 
	Tea Tales: Theotar	 
Speak with Alexstrasza at the Vermillion Redoubt in Twilight Highlands.	A Token of Lost Love	My sister, Alexstrasza, lost her prime consort, Korialstrasz, towards the end of our war with Deathwing. She has loved many in her long life, but none as deeply as he. I know in my heart she loves him still. Find Alexstrasza in the Vermillion Redoubt and ask for a token of her lost love. It will surely prove a powerful reagent for the counter-curse. 
Use Pocopoc to defend the vessel against the devourers.	You Light Up My Life	Great power entices great hunger. The insatiable devourers scale the cliffs in search of sustenance. Soon they will swarm the plateau. They seek to consume all they encounter. The vessel. Its power. Us. This must not come to pass. Wield this automa. Silence their slavering howls. 
Take the portal at the Night Market and speak with Ta'oku.	Above My Station	While I indeed know the location of the Veiled Market, I fear I can do little in terms of providing you with transportation to it. In return for your assistance with a task, I can send you to someone who can assist us both. There is a bounty hunter at Transfer Station Ta, a broker enclave in Bastion. He is better suited to help you... and he owes me a shipment. Meet with Ta'oku and tell him that Ta'nla sent you. For your convenience, I can offer use of a portal. After all, we are partners, yes? 
	Flight School: Flapping Frenzy	 
Find Foreman Thorodir near the Banks of Life.	Trouble in the Banks	Ah, be welcome in my glade, Maw Walker. You are safe here. While it is regrettable that Sorcha must wait for her weapons, it is of paramount importance that I keep my charges safe. I will do anything to prevent them from suffering as the rest of Ardenweald. Perhaps I could ask a small favor of you. I have not heard from the gatherers at the Banks of Life in some time. Would you mind checking on them to make sure they are well? I would go myself, but I must deal with Sorcha. Seek out Foreman Thorodir. 
Search for clues leading to the missing loa.	Following the Trail	I got a bad feelin' about dis, mon. Wildseeds don't just go missing... especially da kind wit' powerful loa in dem! Even da bad eggs like Hakkar and Dambala be protected by da Winter Queen. Someone... or someting... must be stealin' dem! But why? Dey weren't even ready ta be reborn...Search da area and see if ya can pick up da trail. Missing loa be bad for business... and Bwonsamdi be in enough trouble wit' da boss already! 
Defend the Grove of Awakening from the Drust and slay Gorak Zhar.	Drust and Ashes	The Drust encroach upon the Grove of Awakening, George! We must fly in defense of Ardenweald! 
	Chosen Champions	 
Win any Battleground.	Observing Victory	The threads of fate have called you to the realm of conflict, $p. Will you rise to the challenge issued by your territorial rivals? Will you face them in combat and emerge victorious? If you allow me to observe your victory, I will pay you your worth. 
	Tea Tales: Vulca	 
Speak with Fatescribe Roh-Tahl and decide how you want to experience Shadowlands.	The Threads of Fate	It is my duty to observe the strands of fate. The wondrous possibilities that the Purpose lays before us. Fate flows around you, mortal. It shifts. It changes. But I have stilled its movements to offer you... a choice. You may journey through the Shadowlands in the same manner as those who came before you have done. Or you may choose a different path. One that lets you forge a bond with a covenant now, and move freely through the realms of Death to forge your own destiny. What say you, mortal? 
Defeat Wicked Wort.	Outplayed	Now we can strike down their leader, friend. It just so happens that I have a large pouch of puffpetal powder right here. Why don't you take it and toss a few handfuls around the workshop floor at the top of the falls? If they are still there, I imagine they will have an... unfortunate reaction. While you do that I will gather the other elders and make our way to Glitterfall Basin. Speak with the Lady when your task is done. 
	Tea Tales: Lost Sybille	 
Deliver any combination of Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil, or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities.	Callous Concoctions	I witnessed your success with the Pool of Potions and I think you could be of help. Within this larger pool, we create more dangerous mixtures! There are three different oozing ingredients we mix together in different combinations to create violent creatures. When enough ingredients have been added to the pool, the mixture takes shape and a creature will emerge! Bring any combination of these ingredients, Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil, or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities. 
Head to where Cudgelface thinks Huln was taken, and blend in.	The Big Squeeze	So our missin' blue got 'imself dragged off to the big squeeze. Fortunately I am wise to the prise. We'll soft foot it in like we work there, find your moose, avoid eye contact with the fangs, and chisel out of 'ere like we're masons. Follow? 
	Pupa Trooper	 
Summon an elder spirit of Maldraxxus through the Prime Arcanum and defeat it. Summoning requires three players.	Mantle of Mastery	You have done much to establish yourself as a promising acolyte. Your superiors have made it known that you are ready to be tested for your ritualist's mantle. When you are ready, begin the Ritual of Ancient Summoning to call forth an elder spirit of Maldraxxus. Conquer the spirit, and prove your mettle! 
Bring Kowalskos Ariella's Wing.	Broken Wings	You help me? Really? Wow! Look at me. What am I? I have beak. Feathers. Scaly toes. I am bird, yes? But birds have wings. And I have arms. Why I not have wings? I broken. I can not fly. Larion nearby, flies so gracefully. I must study her wings up close! You help me? 
Speak with various broker cartels around Oribos.	Insider Trading	I am the foremost expert on broker culture. However, relationships between cartels are complicated and unstable. Cartel So holds a small presence here in Oribos, which means the other cartels may have knowledge that I do not. Ask around; with your renown, surely they'll have whatever information that we are missing. 
Find the Proto Architect in the Chamber of Shaping and retrieve a Restoration Matrix.	Access Request	The architect alone possesses the Restoration Matrix required for the restoration. The architect will restore the Protoform Repository. The mortal will gain access to the Chamber of Shaping and inform the architect of recent progress. The architect will restore the repository. Fulfillment of the task is imminent. 
Allow Tal-Inara to examine your anima.	Opening the Maw	The Jailer has gained another sigil, and his forces actively assault Oribos. Bolvar Fordragon and Draka of Maldraxxus suggest taking the fight to the Jailer. To do so, we need a way for their forces to safely come and go from the Maw. This was considered impossible before you arrived, but now I believe we have a chance. I must examine your anima to see if this is truly what the Purpose wills. 
Travel to the floating island with a hookshot, then repair the anima conduit.	Hooking Over	I've made some solid hookshots and grapple points. Don't worry--if they hold my weight, they'll hold yours! They can get us across the chasm to the next anima conduit. I'll go on ahead and wait for you. No telling what might be lurking over there. The sooner we get the anima conduit working, the sooner we get into the vault and claim the Primus's sigil. 
Fly with Danica to Korthia to give Bolvar the news.	Good News, Everyone!	Come, friend. Let us be rid of this foul place. No doubt your comrades will be eager to hear the news of the defeat of the Eye. I will bear you to them. Give the word when you are ready to depart, George. 
Find and rescue the three loa trapped within the Maw.	Loa Rescue	We be here for Ashamane, but me sensin' loa bein' tortured up ahead. Three of dem, if me be right. Me don't know who dey be, but dey don't belong in da Maw. We need ta be bringin' dem back ta Ardenweald, too! 
Bring ease to the Soulfused Construct.	Unity	A unique construct has chosen to join us, but its unethical creation leaves it most unsettled. The fusing of fragmented Kyrian souls within this construct, gives it pain and suffering. We must find a way to harmonize these souls so they can live together in peace. Create the Bindings of Wellbeing and bring ease to the Soulfused Construct. 
Examine the missing relics within the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Missing Relics	Thanks to your aid, I have been able to recover more research regarding the lost relics from the vault. I have gone over the codex and believe there are more relics within Korthia that can still be recovered. These were sealed within chests that I believe have been scattered in Korthia during the initial attack. I have set up the missing relics in here. Commit them to memory. They must be recovered. 
Use the Gormherd Branch on Gloober, then collect gorm gris from the Gorged Gormlings.	Collection Day	Now, we can collect the gorm gris for Guardian Kota! Once the gormlings have eaten something, we can 'encourage' them to give it back up. What they produce, we call gorm gris! My Gormherd Branch should encourage them to do this safely. Go on, give it a try on good ol' Gloober first. What has me worried is how the other gormlings might behave. They have been acting so strangely lately! 
	Not Much to Goo On	 
Find Scholar Roh-Suir to learn more about relics.	Researching Korthian Relics	<You find a torn book regarding relics that were being kept within Korthia. A name written within its pages begins to glow: ""Roh-Suir.""The book spins in your hand and points in a direction while Roh-Suir's name pulses. Perhaps this Roh-Suir could help you discover more about the relics you've found.> 
Eliminate 3 nathrezim inside Sinfall.	"The ""Unwelcome"" Guests"	Chelra, I mean Nal'ragas, would not have been working alone. We must assume the worst, that not all of our friends and allies are who they seem to be. It will take time for the Court of Harvesters to render our detection ritual. While we do so we will be exposed. I ask that you use the techniques you employed at Dominance Gate within Sinfall to root out any nathrezim within our ranks. Good hunting. 
Defeat Costel and recover Laurent's belongings.	An Unfortunate Situation	Laurent, mirror maker to the Master. Pleasure to meet you. Excuse my disheveled appearance. It appears I've found myself in a most unfortunate situation. I was attempting to travel on royal business when my mirror sent me to this wasteland instead. Not a moment after I arrived, a band of exiles ripped the clothes right from my back, making it impossible for me to traverse this unforgiving terrain. Assist me and I will endeavor to create a mirror which will allow us to escape this wretched place. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Ardenweald's Tricksters	 
Select a steward to aid you, then return to Kalisthene.	Your Personal Assistant	Here in Hero's Rest, we have a beacon that is the fastest way to draw the Polemarch's attention. It has been quite some time since we have used it, and I am afraid that it has fallen into disrepair. I authorize you to receive a steward companion during your stay here in Bastion. I will call for some to convene here. You may select one to aid you. 
Report to Prince Renathal in Sinfall.	Sinfall	I knew you could be counted on. Revendreth's revival relies on forging pacts with those outside of our realm. The Prince never had any doubt that you would agree to join our cause. He summoned the Court of Harvesters in anticipation of your arrival. Renathal awaits you within Sinfall, where you will be presented to the court. 
Speak with the forward scouts in Korthia.	Surveying Secrets	Each of the covenants have provided their own specialists in their areas of expertise. A few of them have taken to the field to scout this unknown land. Speak with them. They should all be keeping a report of their survey. Return them to me. 
Obtain the Ring of Otherworldly Metal from Mordretha in the Theater of Pain.	A Valuable Find: Theater of Pain	The Theater of Pain in Maldraxxus is a brutal place, where only the strongest survive. With the houses so fiercely in competition with one another, it is considered a great point of pride to house a champion with a winning record. As such, the house lords often outfit their contenders with powerful arms, armor, and trinkets. Often these are storied items that have been passed down through many battles. I would very much like to see such an item. 
See to the needs of the Promenade Champions.	...Even The Most Ridiculous Request!	A fan of the competition, are you? Perhaps you would like to be more than a mere spectator? I will give you a small task... one that not only benefits me, but that also gives you a chance to meet some of the storied competitors here. As you can see, our three remaining houses have sent champions to attend the Contest of Conquest. Talk with them and attend to what needs they might have. 
	Gormling Toss: Spirit Glen	 
Examine the curious creature outside of Exile's Hollow.	Core Control	Your timing is most excellent. It appears one of my traps captured a rather curious creature moments ago. I dare not investigate, but you... you can do this for me. Take Pocopoc along with you. Perhaps there are secrets yet to be discovered. 
Use the Pouch of Spores to plant mushrooms on 15 masked fae in the Stalks.	Mushroom For Improvement	The mushrooms are under attack! I need your help, or we risk losing it all! Some fae wearing strange masks came in and demanded to gain access to the rings. When I told them they were closed due to the drought, they attacked me! I'm too weak to fight back now, and I'm cut off from the center ring. These fae have destroyed so much, but there is something we can do. Sprinkle some of these spores on their corpses so we can regrow the rings. Even when slain, our enemies can still serve Ardenweald. 
Attune 4 Energy Terminals in the Arrangement Index.	Maintenance Mode	The architect set forth these tasks: Stay safe. Restore the Protoform Repository when danger passes. The mortal knows the cyphers. The mortal will help with the tasks. Attuning of the energy terminals is required. Each terminal requires a codex. Invaders pilfered the necessary codices. Go. 
Ride the barge to Tazavesh.	The Veiled Market	Let me guess... Ta'oku sent you my way, yes? <Ta'meri looks at the coin you offer.>So, you seek travel to Tazavesh. Not something we'd typically offer an outsider, but since payment has been accounted for, it would be my pleasure to assist you. Step aboard, and do remember to keep any appendages inside the craft at all times. The currents of the In-Between can be fickle. 
	Flight School: Up and Away!	 
Search near Blackthorn Grove for Ara'lon and the lost hunting party.	The Fate of Ara'lon	George, I have an urgent request to make of you. Recently, the Wild Hunt has been encountering the masked fae in greater numbers... particularly in the area surrounding Blackthorn Grove. I sent a hunting party to investigate, but they have yet to return. Ara'lon was leading the hunt. You have offered him aid before, yes? I ask that you do so again. Search the area for signs of the missing hunters and report back to me. 
Smash the rubble barring access to the secundus locus arrangement.	Between A Rock & A Rock	<Piles of rock are scattered around the area. The devourers have done enough damage to obscure the cypher you seek. Perhaps one of the nearby servitors could be made to clear the rubble.> 
Kill 50 E'rnee Duplicates.	Culling the Maelstrom	Those little E'rnee duplicates were unfriendly. Some effect of the Falls created them. They are not stable. Did you see where they went? They must be culled before they harm the rest of the wildlife. You take care of that while I collect another sample from the Falls. 
Investigate the Genesis Fields.	Danger Near and Far	We have done all we can about the Jailer for now, my friend. Other matters require our attention. Like the devourer rifts I recently saw opening to the east! If we do not stop them, those beasts will wreak havoc on this place. Will you help me take care of them, George? 
Speak with Ve'nari at Keeper's Respite in Korthia.	A Show of Gratitude	Your presence here fulfils an ancient prophecy, Maw Walker. I am certain you and your allies will save us. Perhaps I judged your broker friend too harshly. She did escort you to Korthia, after all. Please extend our thanks to Ve'nari, and let her know we are happy to answer her questions. She... does seem to have quite a number of them. 
Find the Concordance consoles in Zereth Mortis.	Surveying Cyphers	There are many consoles such as that one scattered throughout Zereth Mortis. They have all been beyond my understanding, but perhaps that creature intends to reveal their meaning to us? Fortunately, I know where there are more. I will mark them on your map, and accompany you... for research, of course. Let us see what this creature's purpose is. 
Obtain Honor from Arena Skirmishes.	Observing Skirmishes	Fascinating how much entertainment your kind draws from conflict, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action. I am told that small-scale skirmishes allow your greatest champions to demonstrate their martial superiority over their rivals. No doubt my people would learn much from observing such a contest. Might I have the honor of a demonstration? 
Leashkeeper Helzid and 12 Dominated Jiro slain	Dangerous State	Enemies have attacked the jiro and severed them from the circle. The jiro are no longer stable. They are a danger to the order of things. They must be removed. 
	Antros	 
Return to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Haven.	The Way Forward	I see you have a new friend, Maw Walker! With Pocopoc at your side, I wonder what else you will discover about Zereth Mortis? The secrets we uncover here will be of great help against the Jailer. Perhaps they can teach us how to awaken this oracle. Highlord Bolvar will surely want to hear of them. Please go to Haven and inform him. There is a transporter just outside the cave you may want to use. I will remain here and keep watch over the oracle. 
Use Laurent's mirror to enter Maldraxxus and recover the Medallion of Dominion from Kel'Thuzad.	The Medallion of Dominion	Laurent speaks the truth. We must not delay. This mirror is our entryway into the heart of Maldraxxus. Together with Kael'thas, we will find Kel'Thuzad and rip the Medallion of Dominion from his undeserving grasp. 
Complete 1 quests in Perdition Hold and the Face of Oblivion.	Night Fae Assault	The Jailer's forces have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination! We need your help Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield! 
Collect 10 Death Motes from Ruin's Cradle in The Maw.	Death Motes	I have a task for you, Maw Walker. Souls deemed suitable for service among the Mawsworn are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black shade, devoid of all individual will. It is a tragic end. I wish to better understand this process--what is it about a soul that causes this transformation? Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of them, so that I might learn more about our common adversaries. 
Experiment with Chromatic Rosids near Dimensional Falls.	Flora Aroma	Perhaps we should not experiment on E'rnee without first knowing the effects. Hang on to the rest of these rosids. We can run more tests. Some of the creatures here near the waterfall are more tame than others, and will be suitable for such experimentation. Let us discover whether different creatures have diverse responses to the rosid aroma. 
Go with Draka to the Seat of the Primus.	The Seat of the Primus	This cannot be a coincidence. It is clear that your runeblade is somehow connected to the Seat of the Primus. I will not pretend to know the Primus's agenda. But I would not be surprised if he left behind a way for the worthy to open the door to his sanctum. Draka will bring you to the Seat of the Primus. If you hold the key, mortal, then our victory is all but assured. 
Speak to Elder Kreth in Zereth Mortis.	The Forces Gather	I am relieved that you survived the passage to Zereth Mortis. From what I've overheard of Pelagos's conversation with Kleia, it sounds like you had an incredible journey. These Enlightened brokers could make valuable allies. Their knowledge of the automa and the land itself should help us against the Jailer. Our forces are gathered and ready to follow you to Zereth Mortis. The final battle lies before us, $p. 
Recover the Medallion of Wrath from the nathrezim.	The Nathrezim	The Medallion of Wrath is more than just a powerful artifact. In the hands of a nathrezim it could be used to shape this realm to their dark purpose. What is more, while they hold it we are denied the ability forge a new sigil. They already nearly destroyed the Ember Ward with their reckless schemes. I will not have my medallion used for their ends. Come, let us get it back. 
Investigate the unknown area.	Into the Unknown	Come to pay old Marasmius a visit? I have a special task for you. One of my shoots has found a strange place, a place even I've never seen before. I'm not entirely sure what's in there or if it's even safe. But that's what my trusty mushroomancers are for! What do you say, George? Up for an adventure? 
Defeat Grathalax underneath the Tremaculum in The Maw.	Grathalax, the Extractor	There are many powerful lieutenants among the Mawsworn, but there is one who is particularly important to the Jailer. Far beneath the Tremaculum lives the Jailer's prime interrogator, Grathalax. Power is fed to him via conduits throughout the area. His role is to make the process of anima extraction more efficient. His methods are... unkind. I believe we would both benefit from the end of his existence. 
	Secret Service	 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Resilient Survivors	 
Answer Ve'rayn's questions about the Maw.	Trust Issues	Ah, Maw Walker! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ve'rayn. I deal with assets and liabilities for Cartel Ve. I have heard that you are able to freely travel between Oribos and the Maw, a place of great interest to my cartel. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about it? You will, of course, be properly compensated for your time and information. They are the most valuable of commodities, after all. 
Defend Ardenweald by completing Daily Quests and World Quests, looting treasures, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in the Mists of Tirna Scithe and De Other Side dungeons.	A Call to Ardenweald	Ardenweald is one of our closest allies, and to them we ferry some of the most powerful souls. Should the weald fall, the devastation that would be unleashed could destroy us all. We must aid the Winter Queen. It is the will of the Archon. Go now, and provide support to the Night Fae. 
Use the Matrix Beacon to recover 3 Lost Recordings.	Lost Records	Some of the record keepers fled to this mountain when Korthia was pulled into the Maw. I see no sign of them, but they may have left records behind. Take this beacon. I fashioned it using information from the previous record keepers you rescued. It will lead you to any intact records that are on this mountain. 
Acquire the Helwrought Seal from Kjellrun and release Danica from her captivity.	The Caged Bird	Remain quiet. We must not attract attention. Many of my sisters have already been lost. It will soon be my turn to perish in that witch's vile ritual. Release me from this cage and I can see us both to safety. Keeper Odyn must be warned of this foul betrayal! The Mawsworn called Kjellrun holds the seal that can free me. You can find her gloating in the nearby hall. 
Find 5 Infused Rubies.	The Endmire	Oi! You. Not sure what landed you in the Endmire but I need your help. See these torches? It's my gig to keep 'em lit. But it ain't like they runnin' on flint n' tinder. My stash of infused rubies got hauled off by some devourers when my back was turned. Can ya find 'em before we both get ate by one of these horrors? 
Defeat volatile lured enemies or soak power from pools to reclaim Cosmic Energy to empower Pocopoc.	Borrowed Power	The land provides. The land thirsts. Invaders devour what we require. Reclaim what has been consumed. Absorb what remains abundant. Wings need wind to fly. We need power to ascend. 
Use Mawsworn Chains to kill 6 Helsworn Soulbreakers.	Clip Their Wings	The skies are dark with Helya's kyrian followers. If we do not thin their numbers, Zerekriss and our aerial allies may have difficulties pushing forward. I've noticed that the Mawsworn often use magical chains. We could turn their equipment against them and tear them down from the sky. 
Make a stand against the Scourge invasion.	Lakeshire's Last Stand	There's no time to evacuate... not if the Scourge are here! Board the windows! Get everybody inside! Our only hope is to hide. 
Defeat Tred'ova in The Mists of Tirna Scithe.	Tirna Scithe: A Warning Silence	The songs of Tirna Scithe have faded as the grove wanes, yet there is now silence. Droman Oulfarran's voice has not been heard in some time. The trees whisper of penumbral shadows, discordant songs, and dying roots. All is not well. Friend of Ardenweald, travel to Root-home. Delve into the Mists. Remove that which threatens us. 
Select a champion and Eliminate 3 Mawchained Rampagers and 5 Mawchained Demolishers.	You and What Army	The Jailer has dispatched a force of elite troops to strike our rear lines. Their attack threatens our whole assault! I need you and one other soldier to eliminate these enemies. A volunteer from each of the five houses of Maldraxxus has requested to assist you, George. Pick one and give them the honor of serving alongside you. 
Collect the Inscrutible Phrases.	Aggressive Excavation	Elder Eru said that we could find the most complex examples of the First Ones' language out here. We'll need to fight our way to the vaults, and then infuse the helm once we find those phrases. On a personal note, I never thought I'd have the chance to fight alongside my father. Though with the stakes this high, it somehow feels like exactly the place I'm supposed to be. I am ready when you are. 
Obtain the Fading Memory Glass from Devos, Paragon of Doubt in the Spires of Ascension.	A Valuable Find: Spires of Ascension	You have, no doubt, visited Bastion and seen what happens to souls that are accepted there. Their memories are extracted, viewed, and even stored in their great Temple of Wisdom. This temple houses memories that may answer some of the greatest questions we have about our realm and the worlds beyond. It is a shame they are locked away. We have heard that the fallen Paragon of Loyalty has interest in these memories. Any memory that would catch her attention would surely be worth trading for. 
	The Cost of Death	 
Seek out Au'manal's business associate and offer your assistance.	Tazavesh: A Hard Bargain	Ah, my work looks marvelous on you. You are the very image of legitimacy! And now that I've provided you with my talents, you shall provide me with yours. Seek out my business associate, Fe'tajid, at the Gilded Landing and offer him your assistance. I look forward to hearing of your success. 
Defeat an Unbidden Worldeater.	A New Pack	<The gorger is more than fully grown, rivaling most of the other devourers in the area. It clearly wants to stay with you, but it appears to be uneasy straying too far from the world eaters. Maybe if you take one down together it will not hold as much sway over the gorger.> 
Use Chordy to locate and collect 10 valuable salvage in Maldraxxus.	Something Old, Something Used	Want new luckydos? Chordy is best at finding luckydos! Want to go look around with Chordy?<Chordy looks at you pleadingly with his large eye.> 
Retrieve the Component Beaker from Carnivorous Cervids near Dimensional Falls.	Broker Beaker	I was running some experiments of my own before you got here. Those tests... did not go too well. It turns out some environmental components can aggravate the creatures, turning even the most docile into predators. I dropped my component container and ran, and I cannot recall where I left it. The beaker must be somewhere among the herd of carnivorous cervids. If these flowers do not work, we will need that container for our next round of tests. 
Return to Exile's Hollow.	Lifetimes To Consider	This song has been completed, and harmony has been restored. Yet Zereth Mortis remains haunted by discord. Dissonance lingers still, outside these walls. We must leave before it finds us. Speak with the one you call Firim--he will open the way. 
Defeat Artificer Ligiea and earn the Spear of Kalliope.	The Spear of Kalliope	The Spear of Kalliope is finally in my grasp! With it, I will lay waste to all the Forsworn's enemies. Now behold while I take my prize! 
Defend and capture two locations	A Few Bumps Along the Way	This territory is strategic to our defense, we can not allow these abominations to force our retreat! Seize control of two of the locations marked on your map. Defend them from enemy attack till the flag is planted and the location captured. 
	Tea Tales: Gubbins and Tubbins	 
Investigate the increased activity within Perdition Hold.	Rule 5: Be Audacious	You have proven yourself a useful associate, Mechanic. In thanks, I have crafted a cypher that will allow you to venture further into the Maw. But... it is experimental in nature. You will have to test it in the field. And I have just the test in mind. Cartel Ve has foolishly sent more agents into the Maw. They were captured and taken to Perdition Hold. I must know why. Breach the fortress and learn what has become of the captive brokers. Nothing is more valuable than knowledge of your enemy's plans. 
Complete a Hunt in The Beastwarrens. Suggested Players [5]	Stalking the Warrens	So, they are creating magical beasts deep within the Warrens. Their power is... substantial. Maw Walker, I must trust in you to handle this. While I can provide insight, in combat I must admit your prowess exceeds my own. Hunt the beasts that they train to hunt us. Show the Mawsworn that we too can bare fangs. 
Imbue the Drust Fetish with the power of Gorak Tul.	Into the Flame	I know the curse of which you speak. Dark magic that possesses the mind of the afflicted. Long ago, the Drust were ruled by a sorcerer king named Gorak Tul. It was he who twisted our rituals and set us on the path of death and domination. You will need to claim a portion of his power to break the curse. Take this fetish to Gol Inath and temper it in the Flame of Oblivion. But beware... it is a vile place, and danger lurks among its shadows. 
Navigate the Reanimated Hand to the end of the hall and activate the Corroded Lever.	A Helpful Hand	It takes but a simple act of necromancy to animate a hand. Unfortunately, since you will be in closest proximity, you must be the one to command it. When you are ready, I will reanimate the hand. Once you have control, use it to pull the lever at the end of the hall. Couldn't be simpler, right? 
Aid the covenants in assaulting the Jailer's forces in the Maw.	A Unified Effort	You have made strong allies within your covenant as well as the others within the Shadowlands. This bond is why they have decided to loan aid to our cause. They are ready to fight alongside us as we begin our advance into the Maw. Each covenant will strike at the Jailer from a different area. Help them scour this treacherous land for any who serve Zovaal so that we may put an end to his growing influence. 
Go to the Circle of Glory and fight the val'kyr to determine which are most worthy.	The Chosen Few	I have need of more val'kyr to join Danica in the battle to come. George, you are granted the honor of choosing the most worthy. The strongest will present themselves in challenge at the Circle of Glory. Fight hard, Mechanic, and do honor to your weapons. 
Confront Lysonia in the Altar of Domination.	Her Will, Inflicted	I feel myself drawn across the double bridges to the west...Lysonia must be there. Come, George. We must confront her before she can escape again. Who knows what she plans. 
Locate two offerings within the Walk of Recollection, then proceed to the Vault of the Archon.	Mnemis, At Your Service	Greetings, I am Locus-Keeper Mnemis and I would be delighted to assist you. I recall that you are trying to access a particular memory. Due to the contents, that memory can only be viewed within the Vault of the Archon. In order to gain access to the Vault, you must collect offerings for the two guardians who watch over it. I have hidden these offerings from the Forsworn, as they are not authorized to enter. The Forgelite Prime is the only one among you who can grant authorization. How convenient! 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Extra Pieces	 
Stay near Kodah while keeping enemies away to capture the Protoform Repository.	The Final Song	Servitors do not possess the strength to restore the repositories. Nevertheless, the task must be completed. The mortal must stay close to protect the restoration process. Come. 
Use the mirrors atop Sinfall to seal the gates of Castle Nathria.	Blinded By The Light	$p, Sire Denathrius must be stopped. The anima he is stealing from the Shadowlands is weakening the bonds that seal the Jailer within the Maw. That must not happen. Time is short so we must strike quickly. I would like for you to head up to the surface, into that accursed Light, and align as many mirrors as you can find to the focusing mirror atop the portcullis. We will shine a light on Castle Nathria so bright no venthyr will wish to step forth from that fortress to challenge us. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Bastion with your trainee.	Training in Bastion	Our hunters do not have the time for proper training, and so we must train them in the field. Our allies in Bastion are in desperate need of support, and I wish one of the trainees to accompany you in this endeavor. Do you hear that, trainee? Today, you accompany the Maw Walker! Maw Walker, do not go easy on this one. 
Assist with the preparations and ritual.	Rituals of Night	Tyrande's time grows short, so we must act quickly. <Ysera frowns in concern.>We had hoped to gather more Night Warriors, but we will have to proceed with who we have and hope it is enough.<Ysera shakes her head, then looks more resolute.>Before we can begin, we must finish preparations for the ritual. Please bring these last few items with you and meet us at the grove. 
Report to Finder Ta'sul in Oribos.	Trading Favors	Welcome, friend. I can see by your garb that you must have quite a storied history. Many unique relics befitting of one that has traveled the worlds and vanquished many foes. There are those of us that find great value in such things, and would willingly part with our own valuables for a taste of what you may find. Let your curiosity guide you to the dark hallway across from the cookpots in the next room. Down there, you will find answers. 
Bring the Box of Many Things to the Runecarver.	The Box of Many Things	Ah, Maw Walker, of course. Soon I shall be undone, claimed by this place forever. But you continue to walk its halls, unbroken! It was my great aspiration to prevail with the help of this box. Sadly, I overestimated my own capabilities. I trust I am not overestimating yours. Take the box. Prove yourself worthy of it. 
Gain an audience with the Winter Queen at the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.	Meet the Queen	George, we need only one more piece to complete the Crest of Ascension. Eons ago, our Crest was originally crafted with the assistance of the fae. Deep within Ardenweald lies a portal they maintain to ferry souls back to their worlds. It is a source of great power and the final key to rebuilding the Crest. Seek out the Winter Queen in Ardenweald and plead our case. We've already sent Pelagos ahead as our envoy to arrange for your meeting. 
Craft the Herald's Footpads with Dactylis. Check the materials in the crafting window to learn where you can gather them.	Sourcing Your Own Materials	I can aid you in crafting many pieces of equipment for your soulbinds. Though they may only equip one at a time, each piece grants a new ability that they may not have without it. This time you must source your own materials from around the Shadowlands. When you have collected them, return to me and we can create the footpads! 
Summon and bind your Feral Shadehound.	Feral Shadehound	<The runed armor husk pulses with power and seems to struggle for its freedom. Release your feral shadehound and bind it to you.> 
Return to Tal-Inara in Oribos.	Report to Oribos	Ardenweald has withstood the unrelenting force of the Maw. But it was still not enough. Return to our allies in Oribos. There must be an answer for this loss, and action taken. 
Take specifications for Miru's construct.	Soul Survivor	I knew when you helped me in the Etheric Vault, that you were a just and worthy leader. I have come here to offer you my help and services in your efforts to bring Maldraxxus back into balance. Please, build a construct for me, and allow me to help you as you have helped me. 
Find clues of Cartel Xy's presence.	Traces of Tampering	So the shield has been sabotaged. Of course the ruthless Cartel Xy are the first to attempt to profit off this land. Their greed has put us all in even more danger. We must stop them. Let us search together for signs of their passage. 
Help Bonesmith Heirmir repair the Anima Conduit.	Let the Anima Flow	Tal-Galan briefed me on the situation and explained the vault's workings. As well as any scholarly type could, at least. First we need to ensure the vault is getting power. They use underground conduits to feed it anima. The attendant says that one of these conduits is tucked away in a cave in Scholar's Den. You get me there and I'll find a way to fix it. Just watch my back while I figure out how these Korthian devices work. 
Speak to Tyrande at the Ring of Transference in Oribos.	Penance and Renewal	When I became the new Arbiter, I vowed to myself that I would listen to those around me, to take their counsel into consideration before passing eternal judgment. I have an inkling of what Tyrande intends for Sylvanas. Her fury is tempered by wisdom, and I trust in the decision she has made. Meet her in the Ring of Transference and see her judgment come to pass. 
Go with Pocopoc to make sense of your vision.	What A Long Strange Trip	<The voice from the vision speaks through Pocopoc, albeit distant and distorted.>I... am Saezurah. Oracle. This automa... speaks with my voice. Acts with my will. For now. The pattern... is torn. Disrupted. Mending must be done. A great hunger swarms the sands. What it seeks must not be consumed. Journey with me. Follow my voice. 
Retrieve ""The Infinite Treatises"", ""Worlds Beyond Counting"", and ""Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code.""	Suggested Reading	Greetings. You must be the new aspirant everyone is talking about. I thought you might like to learn more about us. There are three tomes that would serve you well as a starting point, but they are not currently in the library. Aspirant Leda was the last to hold ""Worlds Beyond Counting."" Aspirant Ikaran has yet to return ""The Infinite Treatises.""It seems ""Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code"" went missing some time ago. I would search the village. Once returned, you can read them at your leisure. 
Report to the Lady of the Falls in Glitterfall Basin.	Well, Tell the Lady	<Thorodir breathes a deep sigh of relief.>That's that, I'd say. The Banks are largely safe now, thanks to you. We can handle the rest of the cleanup on our own now. The Lady of the Falls will want to hear of your success here. Why not go tell her the good news? 
Lead Rathan and Emeni to the Body Banks.	Find The Way	I apprenticed at the Stitchyard for many eons. I even worked in the Body Banks with surgeon Stitchflesh to design Emeni's last construct. If we gain control of the Body Banks, we will have the parts necessary to rebuild Emeni and create new bodies for other souls we rescue. Lead us to there and we'll see if we can get it operational. 
	Nurgash Muckformed	 
Capture 10 Neonate Bonetooths.	Smack and Grab	Bonetooths are the backbone of Maldraxxus's armed forces. Those that have been trained well are in demand amongst all of the houses. I always need new bonetooths to train, but they can be rather difficult to collect. Bring me some of the younger ones, and I will reward you greatly. Be advised that you may need to weaken them before you are able to capture them. 
Lure 30 gormlings to the wrangler in the Banks of Life.	Tied Totem Toter	Hope you've caught your breath. The totem is now a big, tasty beacon to all the nearby gorm. They're going to want to eat it and you're going to be carrying it! We need to rehome the smaller ones. If they stay here they're just going to get big and angry again. If you can drop off a few groups of them outside the Banks of Life we can make sure they find their way to more balanced feeding grounds. Let Thorodir know when you're done. I will let him know the plan. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Buzz	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
	Plundered Knowledge	 
Collect 3 Forsworn Uniform Pieces and a Quartermaster's Insignia from within Kalliope's Rest.	How to Become Forsworn	The Forsworn have taken control of Kalliope's Rest and are looting its antiquities. They must be looking for the Spear of Kalliope, a relic of great power. Their numbers are far too great and we are no match. Perhaps there is another way? A small group of aspirants is removing artifacts from the shrine. If you gather uniform pieces and an insignia from them, we can get you inside the shrine unnoticed. 
Slay spriggans in the central garden.	The Garden of Night	That should take care of things out here. Now we must tend to the inner garden. Once we're done, I'll sort out my recalcitrant husband. Hopefully, any remaining spriggans will have cleared out on their own after hearing us dispatch the others. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Heartbond Lupine	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Find Lillythistle in the Gossamer Cliffs.	Silk Shortage	We are running short on silk! We use it for so many things, like instruments, weapons, and tools. But our supply has dried up! We are in desperate need for fresh silk. Our main hub of silk production is in the Gossamer Cliffs. If you could, seek out Caretaker Lillythistle, and see what the holdup is! 
Participate in Tal-Galan's Maw Walker trial.	Who is the Maw Walker?	Korthian prophecies foretell the arrival of a Maw Walker who can save us from disaster. Perhaps this is that day. But perhaps not. I must test your anima to verify your claim. If you speak the truth, then I have a solemn duty to empower your anima before we proceed. 
Accept responsibility for Maelie.	Maelie, The Wanderer	I can't thank you enough for finding Maelie! You know, I think she's just a little bit more than I can handle. Would you mind watching over her? I think she's really taken a liking to you! 
Establish a connection between Korthia and Ve'nari's Refuge.	Ease of Passage	Korthia is ripe with opportunity. Look at all of these intriguing objects. In anticipation of such wonders, I have come prepared. Let us find a suitable location and establish a more permanent connection between this place and my refuge. Our work together is not yet finished. 
Defeat the Mawbound Monstrosity and infuse the final shard.	What We Overcome	I understand now. All of us that were touched by Domination were able to tap into something. Whether nobility or vengeance, it gave the strength to resist. With all that I have faced, I have to remember that I am still here. And if there are those willing to stand with Sylvanas, I have to believe they will stand with me as well. I'm ready to try again. This time, I will overcome whatever I face. 
Connect the anima flow to the Unlocking Obelisks.	Slaylines	Gaining entrance to the Sepulcher is no easy feat, George! Not only were guardians put in place, but an elaborate magical lock was created to seal the door. To open the way, the two obelisks which control the lock must be fed anima. Fortunately, there are some empowered crystals in the area we can use for this purpose. Locate the focus crystals and redirect their anima flow into the obelisks. Then the secrets of the Sepulcher will soon be ours! 
Learn of Sire Denathrius' fate from Prince Renathal.	The Dawnkeep Prisoner	Oh, you have not heard the news yet. We have him. Sire Denathrius, Master of Revendreth, imprisoned within his own blade. We managed to best him during one of our recent raids of Castle Nathria. It took an army of unparalleled valor and preparation. It took skill and wealth. It took a miracle. And so the redeemer shall be redeemed. Would you like to know more? 
	We'll Workshop It	 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Raptora Swooper	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Serenade	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Use Soulshape to collect anima from Proglo, then infuse the wildseed with the collected anima.	Infusing the Wildseed	Dreamweaver tells me of a ritual to quell the wildseed's nightmares... but it will require anima. A soul named Proglo lives beneath this tree, gathering anima for the grove's caretakers to use. His mortal life came to a violent end, and his soul has been skittish ever since. He will not respond well to your current form. I will grant you the ability to assume the soulshape of a fox. Approach Proglo in your new form to gain his trust and ask for his anima. 
Collect 10 Tears of the Damned from Gorgoa: The River of Souls.	Tears of the Damned	To anchor the instrument to the Maw and make it capable of the effect you seek, it must be imbued with the raw, unfiltered agony endured by the souls trapped in this cursed prison. Sorrow is abundant here, and therefore simple to obtain. You need only travel to Gorgoa. The damned shed copious tears that fall as crystalized grief as they are swept along the River of Souls. Be careful that their sadness does not overwhelm you. 
Slay 4 Enraged Forgeshard and Collect 4 Soulsteel Embers.	The Ember Count	Theotar's brilliance is undeniable, but far too many overlook the ingenuity of his dredger helpers, Gubbins and Tubbins. Look to that ridge beyond us. The Jailer's forges over there are spewing out Soulsteel Embers. We could accomplish many things with a mirror made from them...Gubbins has already crafted a special parasol, capable of shielding its wielder from any falling embers. Meet him by the forges and obtain some of those Soulsteel Embers! 
Find a way into Torghast, Tower of the Damned.	Into Torghast	The bond to your covenant is growing stronger, George. Good. The power lies within you to venture into Torghast and rescue our allies. You saw Baine Bloodhoof while assisting the broker in the Maw. Perhaps this Ve'nari knows a way to breach the Jailer's tower and find the chieftain. When I peered into Torghast once before, you stood at my side. I believe that connection will allow me to see through your eyes as you navigate its torments. Seek out Ve'nari and request her aid, Maw Walker. 
Redirect the mirror fragments to free Simone.	Moving Mirrors	What sort of horrific trap is this? The Light is being reflected directly on her! Simone's a dear friend of mine! Free her from that thing, please! 
Report to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Oribos.	The Highlord Calls	Highlord Fordragon has requested your presence in Oribos. We know only that it involves the Maw. Go to him, and show him that the Maldraxxi will never falter. Even in the face of that dark place. 
	Dirty Job: Demolition Detail	 
Collect 10 Essences of Misery and destroy the Misery Conduits.	Misery Business	The Mawsworn have begun harvesting the misery of the souls flowing through Gorgoa, the river of souls. Why? I do not know yet. But it behooves us to stop them. Destroy the conduits that they deposit the misery into and bring me some samples of their work. Perhaps with some research, I can discern their intentions. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Mawdapted Raptora	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Herd Bubbling Oozes to Kevin so Plague Deviser Marileth has a present to bring to the Ember Court.	RSVP: Plague Deviser Marileth	Oh! This sounds like a wonderful opportunity to do field research in Revendreth, apprentice. I look forward to collaborating with new colleagues. We must bring a gift to thank them for their invitation. What could be more appropriate than some lovely slimes? Please pick some of the best slimes for me to present to our host. Just bring them to Kevin so they can make friends and travel together. 
Speak with Prince Renathal at Dawnkeep in Revendreth.	Dread Tidings	The threat the nathrezim pose to our forces must not be underestimated. They are cunning, rivaling the best veterans of the House of Eyes, and we do not know their full plan. Among the venthyr there is one whose wrath scourged the nathrezim from the Shadowlands for many thousands of years. I ask you travel to Sinfall, seek out Prince Renathal, and deliver to him this missive. I shall send one of my own spies, the Baroness Vashj, to meet you there. Make use of her experience with the nathrezim. 
Speak with House of Plagues survivors.	A Plague on Your House	Though the physical House of Plagues is lost, the knowledge contained within was not. There are survivors here that continue to research and develop new horrifying weapons. In time we will restore the house and rise to even greater power, unleashing creations and plagues never before seen upon our enemies! Perhaps you can help? Speak with survivors and see if any of them can use your aid. 
Collect the Sigils of Binding	Mal'appropriated	<The dreadlord catches your eye, wishing to speak. You glance at your companions. Moonberry urges you forward with a mischievous grin. You step as close as you dare.>Free me from this prison, mortal, and you will have my favor. I am aligned with powers greater than these pathetic puppets or their masters. They have no concept of the true forces at work. All I need are the sigils of binding which hold me. The rest I can... take care of. Free me, and you will be granted untold power. 
Meet Kleia outside the Temple of Humility.	On Lysonia's Trail	Our scouts have reported spotting Lysonia and Uther en route to the Temple of Humility. As the de facto leader of the Forsworn, we must not allow her to stand free, twisting the minds of those around her. The disciples of Humility have not answered our beckons. I have sent Kleia ahead to reconnoiter. Meet her outside the temple. 
Use Roseboil's Regenerative Molt to cure 15 Plague-ridden Survivors.	Cure For All Ills	Many survivors from the House of Plagues are still in need help. Their suffering fills me with great sadness. Maw Walker, I'd do anything to help them. Even saving a few is better than saving none. Please, help me cure them! 
Place 4 Stygia Conduits at marked locations within Calcis in The Maw.	The Jailer's Share	The Mawsworn's torturers have a talent for misery. The suffering they inflict often produces more stygia than they can collect. The excess floats loosely in the air, left to drift into the abyss. I have fashioned a conduit specifically for capturing the leftover stygia. You can borrow it if you wish. There are a handful of prime gathering locations throughout Calcis. As you'll be using my conduits, we can split what you find upon your return. 
Upgrade Abominaton Factory to Tier 1	Stitching Time	With the proper resources we can build a force of construct warriors greater than anything ever seen in the Shadowlands. Visit Arkadia Moa and see if you can secure the resources we need. 
Collect Firim's Research Notes and deliver them to Rafiq.	The Necessity Of Equipment	I have been sharing research for some time with an associate of mine, Rafiq. It is only through our shared efforts that he has been able to acquire useful items. Deliver my latest research notes to Rafiq and see if you can earn favor with him. In time, he should be able to aid you with better equipment. 
Speak to Cortinarius outside the Stalks.	Silence in the Stalks	Hmm. Well that's not... great. But no cause for alarm, yet! It has been a long time since our ring withdrew from here, and we probably need to go to its source to get it to return! Unfortunately, I haven't heard from the Chief Mushroomancer, Cortinarius, since the crisis began. Please, find him and help us rejoin the rings! Head west of Dreamsong Fenn to the Stalks. You can't miss them... just follow the mushrooms! 
Speak to the Covenants. Decide how your path is entwined with the Purpose.	Choosing Your Purpose	Each covenant is vital to the Shadowlands. Though they have been isolated and divided as of late, the Purpose depends on the success of their efforts. All of the covenants must bolster their strength to face the threat of the Banished One. But your contributions cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice. Speak to your potential allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me. 
Hunt the Accuser.	The Accuser	It is time to hunt our final prey, the Accuser. Anima drought or not, her sycophantic adherence to sacred ""rituals"" flies in the face of the Master's will. I can't wait to see the fear in her eyes. 
Bring Gertie Jr. to the Heart of the Forest.	Silk for Ardenweald	It's clear that we may not be able to consistently supply Ardenweald with silk. But there is something that will help. Take Gertie Jr. and the silk you collected from the other silkstriders back to the Heart of the Forest. There, she will be safe, and perhaps grow up into a silkstrider as grand and beautiful as her mother! 
Follow Mindscorched Alwin through the Ashen Traverse.	Actions Speak Louder than Words	<The ash ghoul inspects you, checking your weapons and armor closely. He shifts his eyes from you to your kyrian companions before checking back in with Theotar, who nods to him. Alwin motions for you to follow him.> 
Use the siphoning device to drain rage from the Furious Shades in the River of Souls.	Anger Management	I am no musician, though I've spent many an hour enjoying the entertainment in Tazavesh. Giving this horn a voice will require the harvest of strong emotions. Anger seethes unrestrained within the damned unfortunates consigned to the River of Souls. Use this siphoning device to drain the rage of these furious shades into your instrument. The shrieks of fury that you acquire should allow you to pierce the Maw and reach your allies. The tune, I suspect, will not be a popular one. 
	Connecting It All	 
Meet Theotar at the Sanctuary of the Mad in the Ember Ward.	Land of Light	The Ember Ward is filled with outcasts from Revendreth society, whether they rebelled, crossed a noble, or simply looked at Denathrius wrong. It is a Light-scorched land that drives venthyr mad, unless they manage to stay within the shadows. If Alwin is there, it may be too late. Let us visit Theotar at the Sanctuary of the Mad. I'm sure he will be pleased to see you. 
Meet Mikanikos at the Eternal Forge.	The Eternal Forge	The Forgelite Prime has taken up the mantle of building our new Crest of Ascension. No ordinary tools or materials will do. He will require Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons, Hammer of the First Forgelite. It sits at the shrine to the First Forgelite in the Eternal Forge. The Forsworn have taken over this forge to create their own endless centurion army. You must meet Mikanikos at the forge, push back the Forsworn, and retrieve Phaestus for our own uses. 
Activate the Path of Ascension.	The Path of Ascension	With the anima you collected, we can once again start up the Path of Ascension. The eternal training ground of the kyrian, the Path is an ancient tradition and favored amongst many of the kyrian, aspirant and ascended alike. The Hands of Courage, Apolon and Artemede, have stepped up to lead this tradition. Once you herald the Path's rebirth, speak to them to learn more. 
Eliminate Custos.	WANTED: Custos	A once-stable automa is showing signs of unusual dysfunction, attacking Enlightened along the road outside of Pilgrim's Grace. It is essential that the roads remain safe for our pilgrims. Rafiq has designated the elimination of this threat to be of the highest priority. 
	A Night in the Woods	 
Meet Draka near Desmotaeron.	The Chains of Command	If we must hold a position so near to the Jailer's lands, we need to provide some assurances. Vyraz and Helya have retreated within the walls of Desmotaeron. They have grown lax in their expected safety, which provides us with an opportunity. We will take them by surprise. Strike swiftly and without mercy, and perhaps we can cut the heads off those snakes. 
Slay The Tithelord and collect the Medallion of Envy.	The Tithelord	With his army defeated, the Tithelord is vulnerable. Now, he has but a small contingent to protect him. Let us strike him down decisively. He draws power from these anima wells, keeping it all for himself. If you can hold his attention, I can not only empower you to defeat him but also disable the wells. Speak to me when you are ready to begin. When the time is right, the baroness will lead our new recruits into battle. 
Assist with the ritual and infuse the Shards of Domination.	What We Wish to Forget	While the language of the Progenitors will aid us, there is another trait that will help break Domination's hold on us. An indomitable will. Those of us who have endured before, and survived, have that inherent resistance, which we will offer up to be infused into each of the shards. The Primus has assured me that this will work. With no other options, this is the only way. I trust that it will be worth the suffering. 
	Calling the Champions	 
Examine the fractals that surround Saezurah's body.	Music of the Spheres	It started gradually, the energy emanating from the oracle in increasing amounts, until the grand design you see before you took shape. The terrible clamor ringing in our ears began shortly afterward. My attempts to approach the fractals have been... unsuccessful. But they appear to resonate with Pocopoc. You share a special bond with it; perhaps you shall have better luck than I. 
Accept Nilganihmaht's help.	Gotta Hand It To Ya	Your power Maw Walker... it rivals even mine before Zovaal separated my body. This is but a small part of my whole, but more than enough...Allow me to aid you in your efforts against Zovaal. In doing so my vengeance will be fulfilled. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Micro Defense Force	 
Collect 15 Lost Animacones. Use Toothpick's World Shaker to unearth them.	Old Stomping Grounds	Once, long ago, I journeyed to Ardenweald to assist in putting down a threat now long forgotten. I remember that while there, I saw small creatures taking tiny clusters of anima--animacones, the fae called them--and buried them under the soil. If those clusters are still there, we must gather them for ourselves! I should be able to unearth any of the animacones we encounter. Let's go hunt for them! 
Use the Fungal Beacon to repair 6 Damaged Mushrooms.	Ring Repairs	The damage wrought here is severe, but it can be reversed. My master is weakened by all this destruction, but mushrooms are difficult to completely eradicate. By restoring power to the rings throughout the grove, we can strengthen them once again. Take this beacon. Use it near a damaged mushroom in a ring, and watch how quickly nature can heal its wounds. 
Find Laurent on the Sinfall ramparts.	Mirror to Maldraxxus	I've received word that Laurent's made substantial progress with his repairs. Once the mirror has been restored, we can realize our efforts to recover the final medallion. Head to the ramparts and see if his work is near completion. 
Release Sabina from her shackles.	Setting Sabina Free	Release me. Please, you must do so. I cannot linger in the Light any longer. This unease, it's so... familiar, but it will pass. I will feel myself once again, once I have returned to the shade. I'll stay as still as silence while you work the lock. 
Meet with The Curator in Darkhaven in Revendreth.	Assistance from Sinfall	In order to defeat the Forsworn, the Crest needs an artifact that embodies repentance, atoning for past mistakes and moving forward. I have an artifact in mind. Long ago, many souls from Revendreth arrived in Bastion. Purer souls than we have ever received from Revendreth. They bore the mark of the Seal of Contrition, a focus that expedited their cleansing. Go to Revendreth and find this seal so that we may harness its power. 
Recover the Stolen Artifact in the Arrangement Index and restore it to its rightful place.	Selfless Preservation	The automa were once abundant here, singing, constructing various things, carrying out the purpose of the First Ones. Then, invaders from the Maw slaughtered them all. The last automa to fall were protecting something important in a nearby structure. I witnessed one of the cursed Mawsworn steal a device by the door. The Elders say we should not meddle with artifacts, but would it be a transgression to recover what was stolen? 
Begin your journey to Zereth Mortis by mounting the anima wyrm.	A Hasty Voyage	The path to Zereth Mortis is open. We must part ways here. The Eternal Ones are forbidden from returning to the place of our creation. Zovaal has defied the most sacred laws of the Progenitors. You must undertake this journey alone. Go. Find a foothold in Zereth Mortis so that we can send the covenant forces through. Then we will pursue the Jailer and end his madness. 
	Fishing: Speckled Flametail	 
Forge official documents condemning you to the Ember Ward.	Sign Your Own Death Warrant	Ember Ward only for bad buds!<Stonehead squints at you and shakes head.>You not look like other bad buds! Bad buds come with bad paper! 
Travel to Torghast by jumping into the Ring of Transference, then find any entity there that needs your aid.	Tower of the Damned	We know little of Torghast. However, Fatescribe Roh-Tahl claims there is work that must be done there. He believes there is a path for you to reach this place... and that someone there requires your aid. Do what you must to reach Torghast and aid anyone who is within. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Forged Spiteflyer	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Disguise yourself as a member of House Iremoore and steal the House Briarbane mascot.	RSVP: The Countess	The Prince wishes to host court? Well, that should be interesting...I am sure you understand that one musn't give without receiving something of value in return. It sets a terrible precedent, provides unrealistic expectations, and encourages beggars. So you shall do something for me. House Briarbane is very proud of their new mascot. They have been flaunting it in the streets and irritating the other houses. Steal it for me, but incriminate one of the other houses in the act. 
Complete the Ritual.	Acquaintances Forgotten	It is time. The song shall bring life anew. Tell me when you are ready to begin. 
Recover the broker device outside of Perdition Hold.	Rule 7: Betrayal is Inevitable	Our arrangement has been quite lucrative. Reliable associates like yourself can be so hard to find. I believe I can entrust you with a task I would usually perform on my own. While working with the tracking runes you retrieved for me earlier, I detected a device of broker origin nearby. It must have been brought into the Maw by the captured expedition. Please examine it and prepare it for transport back to the refuge. I will join you shortly. This could be a valuable discovery. 
Speak to Tal-Inara to enter the Arbiter's chambers.	A Gathering of Covenants	Though the Jailer remains confined to the Maw, his cruelty extends beyond the bounds of his prison. Thankfully, the Archon is recovering from the attack. Though I am told her wound has an... unsettling quality. The Eternal Ones and their allies await you and Highlord Fordragon in the Arbiter's chamber. I shall open the way. With her voice have I spoken. 
Use Laurent's Compact Looking Glass to reveal the Hidden Mirror in Bastion.	Hidden Mirror	If Renathal is going to put the Harvesters' medallions to use, he's going to need a conduit to focus that power. Denathrius's corruption taints the forges of Revendreth. Our best option is in Bastion. As denizens of Revendreth, Bastion will not allow us to enter through Oribos. We will need you to activate a mirror hidden away there long ago. Take this. We concealed it at a rarely used site, the Veiled Enclave. There should be no one there, especially with the drought. 
Explore Torghast for clues to locate your allies.	Explore Torghast	Baine is safe, but our other allies are still prisoners of the Jailer. They remain in grave peril. Torghast is a constantly changing place, shifting according to the will of its master. It may be impossible to track them through normal means. Enter its cell blocks and see what information you can find. Seek any clue that might lead us to our missing friends, and bring it back to me. 
Collect 4 Maldraxxi Bone Marrow.	Pie Not?	I want to cook something warm, savory, and gooey! That's right! I want to make a lovely bone marrow pie! When it's done, you'll be as full as a tick. I guarantee it! Now, just any old marrow won't do. I need the very best and rarest marrow. And that's where you come in! I need you to help Mama out and dig that marrow up. Yes... dig. Oh and be ready to knock some heads. Maldraxxus doesn't take kindly to being carved up. 
Use the Overcharged Goliath Cores on the Depleted Goliaths in Aspirant's Awakening, then use the Soul Mirror to capture a memory of Kalisthene.	A Suitable Opponent	The opponents you train against in the coliseum are not physical beings, but rather manifestations of such. Your first opponent is one you and your soulbinds have met numerous times before -- the Ascended Kalisthene. Asking another kyrian to be your opponent in the Path is a great honor, as it tells them that you have much to learn from them. Go to Aspirant's Awakening and use the cores to summon Kalisthene by calling back to your first introduction. It is as ceremony states. 
Speak with Assistant Scholar Kah-Vez to upgrade one piece of equipment from Korthia.	Empowering Equipment	The research you find can unlock many possibilities. One such avenue is improving some equipment that you may find within Korthia. Speak with my assistant nearby. He can use our research to restore this equipment to its former power. 
Gather the Watchers, Bearers, Centurions, and Collectors.	Before the Dawn	We shall need all we can muster if this day is to be ours. Gather them all. The Watchers, Bearers, Centurions, and Collectors. Tell them that their Archon calls for them. Our Paragons will clear a staging ground at the Court of Elation for the final assault. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Desertwing Hunter	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Meet the Accuser at Absolution Crypt.	Our Forgotten Purpose	I have no quarrel with you, Maw Walker. The Lord Chamberlain and his abhorrent followers have debased these halls with their perversions of the rituals. Abusing souls and destroying their potential for pathetic mockeries of power. The Accuser would never have allowed this. I have heard rumors that you may still be in contact with her. If so, please inform her of the situation here. She will bring these depraved dogs to heel. 
Deliver 3 Centurion Parts and 15 Automaton Bolts to Mikanikos	Putting A Plan Together	While Maldraxxus pushes the main gate, we can take the side gate with the help of our Centurions. The remains of many Corrupted Centurions taken by the Jailor litter this area. Their parts could be used to build new ones to help in the assault. See if you can locate the parts we need to build a new Centurion. 
Help Rathan to create a new construct body for Chordy.	Build-A-Bomination	We need to get to work, every soul here needs a body. We have the parts to build a body for Chordy. Chordy is a great scavenger, rebuilding him could allow us to find more construct parts easier. Would you help me to rebuild him? 
Travel with Ysera back to the Heart Tree to join the Covenant.	For Queen and Grove!	A stunning performance... in more ways than one. So much has transpired on Azeroth in my absence. But there was one dream I did not see portrayed onstage. I dreamt of Tyrande, engulfed in darkness, twisted by anger and a thirst for vengeance. I witnessed a forbidden ritual, the rise of a new Night Warrior, and a hunt that can end only in tragedy. That too must be real.<Ysera shakes her head.>The Winter Queen awaits you in the Heart of the Forest. We had best be on our way. 
Increase your Renown.	Machinations of War	With Bastion as our ally, we have the strength to crush Gharmal and the House of Constructs. We'll gather the supplies for the attack, but our soldiers need a great champion to follow into battle. Prove to them that you are the champion they seek. 
Use Chordy to locate and collect 10 valuable salvage in Ardenweald.	A Bountiful Haul	Chordy want to go on adventure! You want to go too, yes? I scavenge, weapons, armor, and valuable luckydos! Though, luckydos seem to be in short supply these days. We go to land of tree people! If we search together, we'll find many luckydos! 
Eliminate Enemy forces and positions.	Deadly Reminder	Our defense is tenuous at best, but the enemy is still hesitant to attack. As long as they fear us, they won't be probing our defenses. You must keep the pressure on the enemy. Attack their positions all along our line. 
Follow Ta'eran to the Sepulcher of Knowledge and hear his proposal.	Read Between the Lines	Ah, mortal, how fortunate that I, humble Ta'eran, happen to be standing here just as you, the outsider everyone is talking about, happens to wander by! In the spirit of cooperation and mutual interests, there is a matter I wish to discuss. A nearby structure called the Sepulcher of Knowledge was built as a repository for military strategy. I fear the knowledge contained within may soon be lost. If you would do me the honor of escorting me to the Sepulcher, I can share what else I know. 
Ask Ve'nari's help to bind the Ilskahorn to the Maw.	Mawsplaining	There remains one task now before the glorious battle can begin. The horn must be anchored to the Maw so that its voice may pierce the barrier that surrounds that foul realm. How this can be done, I do not know. Seek out one that understands the mysteries of that place. Surely they can guide your hand. Danica and her sisters will listen for Ilskahorn's call. They will answer when you need them, George. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Uncomfortably Undercover	 
Test the Broken Helm on creatures in Zereth Mortis.	Testing One Two	The creatures of Zereth Mortis have existed here since well before I created Domination. We have seen the effects that Zovaal's forces have had on them, but I believe there is more to be learned. Use the helm on the denizens of Zereth Mortis and see what you can uncover about a natural resistance. 
Defeat 3 opponents within the Theater of Pain.	The Ladder	Within the Theater of Pain, <brother/sister>, legends rise like cream to the top. Listen to me, <brother/sister>. If you have the courage to step into that sacred arena, you're going to face the greatest threats in all of existence! The cards will be stacked against you, but only those who can work together will emerge as champions. Gather your team and meet this challenge head on! Enter the Theater of Pain and defeat the opponents within! Prove that you can rise to the top! 
	Who Devours the Devourers?	 
Reflect on the Scrolls of Remembrance with Alexandros Mograine.	All I Ever Will Be	This is the site of an ancient battle won by the previous Paragon of Courage. She sacrificed herself to serve the Shadowlands. I only hope my own end will prove as exemplary. Many of my disciples meditate upon the scrolls here. With them, we remember the foundation of our courage. Accompany Alexandros as he reflects on his shrines. Aid him in understanding where the source of his courage lies. He will learn that this afterlife is not the one suited for him. 
Collect 4 Pungent Swarmer Toxin from Ravenous Swarms.	A Rousing Aroma	<Sabina is unresponsive. Her exposed flesh cracked and blistered. Perhaps something with a pungent aroma will rouse her.> 
Kill 12 Torghast enemies pulled out of the portal by Fangcrack.	Fangcrack's Fan Club	Fangcrack is the strongest dredger I e'er seen! He's incredible! He's down there, reaching into dat big Torghast portal, pulling the baddies right out o' their home! They don't even know what's happenin' half the time, ha ha! Me and Cudgelface joined his fan club soon as we got here. You want in? You gotta earn your membership same as everyone else: go down there and fight whatever he pulls out of the portal! 
Defeat 15 Mawsworn invaders.	Carving Out a Path	While I abhor violence and prefer a reasoned response to conflict, there is no alternative here. In order for Roh-Suir and I to escape safely, you must deliver a decisive strike to the Mawsworn who have invaded Seeker's Quorum. Carve out a path so that we may escape. 
Speak to the Primus, then claim the Sigils from each covenant.	Covenants Renewed	Our efforts were focused on preventing the Jailer from shattering the barrier around the Maw and invading the rest of the Shadowlands. Instead, he expanded the Maw itself to envelop Oribos and claim the Aribiter's sigil. I do not fully understand what we witnessed atop Torghast. But the Primus certainly does. It is time to enact his contingency plan. The covenants will arrive with their sigils shortly. Inform the Primus that we are ready to begin. 
Aid Revendreth by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Revendreth dungeons.	Reinforcing Revendreth	Denathrius must be stopped at all costs. However, we've no hope of taking him out while his forces still control much of Revendreth. If you are here to aid us, then there is no shortage of work to be done. Disposing of my father's many allies being chief among that work, of course, but any aid you can provide will be of use. There is too much at stake for all the Shadowlands if we fail. I will see to it that you are handsomely rewarded for your efforts. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Russet Bufonid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Retrieve Korinna's Allaying Crook from Kala inside her den.	Tough Love	Heavens! Kala has flown off with Korinna's Allaying Crook! I saw her fly into her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she's in there. Please be careful, but do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient. Here, take her slobber ball. It's her favorite and may help to distract her. 
Charge the Amulet of the Horsemen.	The Hunt for the Baron	<The amulet Bolvar gave you flickers with a faint red light, then grows dim. To be useful in finding Darion Mograine, you must find a way to restore its potency. You recall an area called Zovaal's Cauldron that was teeming with dark magic. Perhaps the amulet's power could be restored there.> 
Travel to the Maw to find the lost wild god of Ardenweald.	Maw Manifested	Ya heard it from Mueh'zala himself... tanks to ol' Bwonsamdi. Dere be an ancient spirit trapped in da Maw. Me bettin' da Winter Queen gonna want it back. Good ting ya been goin' down dere yaself, hm? Should be nice an' easy for ya. Me gonna clean up da rest of da undead here. Meet ol' Bwonsamdi in Ardenweald when ya get back. 
Collect 1 Witch's Satchel from the Oaken Assembly in Ardenweald.	Witch's Satchel	I sent Ara'lon to steal a witch's satchel from the Drust... a dangerous task from which he has yet to return. The Drust's nightscreamers carry many reagents we need to perform the ritual. We cannot proceed without one. You must go to the Oaken Assembly to procure one of their satchels... and find Ara'lon, if you can. 
Bring the Bulwark of Divine Intent to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Bulwark of Divine Intent	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex confirms that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shield in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Bring the Meandering Story to Archivist Dreyden in the Grove of Memory.	A Meandering Story	<A quick glance at this heavy tome reveals flowery language and a plot that doesn't seem to go anyplace. At least not in the first few chapters. There is some dirt on the cover, but the damage isn't too bad. This book doesn't seem to have found itself in too much trouble-- a bit like its plot. Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.> 
Find Laurent in the Ember Ward.	A Master of Their Craft	If we wish to get a travel network up and running, we'll need a master mirror maker in our employ. I've heard rumors that one such tradesman has landed himself in the Ember Ward. I am sure it won't take much cajoling to convince him to join our ranks. Head back into the Ember Ward and find this master mirror maker. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	The Mind Games of Addius	 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Mega Bite	 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Bronzewing Vespoid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Recover the Primus's Sigil within the vault of Korthia.	Into the Vault	The destruction here is... overwhelming.<Tal-Galan quietly utters a prayer.>Anima flows into what remains of the vault. We should now be able to enter. Once inside, I will work on recovering the Primus's sigil. Please show reverence within the vault. It is a sacred place that few are allowed to see. Even the prophecies did not foretell that a living mortal would gaze upon the secrets within. 
	Researching the Solution	 
Kill 10 Invading Gorgers and Reality Breachers.	An Automa-free Diet	These devourers are relentless! They feed on any energy they can find. If left unchecked, they would surely devour the whole of Zereth Mortis. We cannot allow the creations of the First Ones to be sullied by these invaders! I am no fighter. But you... perhaps the First Ones delivered you to us after all. Will you help? 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Tarachnid Creeper	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Meet the Accuser at Absolution Crypt.	The Absolution of Souls	Do you not yet understand the purpose of Revendreth, Maw Walker? The souls under our care teeter on the brink of permanent damnation. Even with perfect attention and careful processing, not every soul can escape the Maw and be elevated to a higher destiny. That is true under the best of circumstances. Currently, due to your installation of the Chamberlain at the Halls of Atonement, we're instead witnessing the worst of circumstances. We must return to the Halls of Atonement and enforce order. 
Investigate the Slumbering Vault.	Following the Leader	We sealed the door to the Slumbering Vault when we first arrived. It is a sanctum, a cradle of all that is precious here. The power that sleeps within should not be touched by us. If the Xy leader made it past the shields while we were distracted by the beauty of this place, I shudder to think of what they have already disturbed. Hurry! We must go to the Slumbering Vault and ensure its safety. 
Defeat Amarth the Harvester and Nalthor the Rimebinder in the Necrotic Wake.	Necrotic Wake: A Paragon's Plight	Xandria, the mighty Paragon of Courage, is the finest warrior among all the ascended. But even she may be overwhelmed by the strongest of Maldraxxus' forces. Your fate is intertwined with hers, now. You must gather your allies and plunge into the Necrotic Wake to ensure both Amarth and Nalthor do not make it back to the safety of their realm. May the Archon guide your blade into their hearts. 
Track down and defeat 5 Dreadlord Infiltrators.	Spy vs Spy	Nathrezim. Dreadlords. The Unseen Guests. Call them what you will, they are a race that was crafted to be the greatest collection of spies and infiltrators in all of reality, once upon a time. Their intrusion has underestimated three things. Kael'thas Sunstrider, Baroness Vashj, and George! I have brought a tool Kael'thas and I used to detect nathrezim when we served under Illidan. And I am the matron of spies! Let us hunt these intruders down. 
Join the Stonewright as she investigates the Envoy.	The Unseen Guests	Dreadlords. Of course. Of course they would come back now of all times. I half suspected they returned during the drought. I was not entirely convinced you were not one, the first time I saw you. They have gotten more clever over the eons since they fled Revendreth. But not clever enough... I think. Come, Maw Walker. Follow me and do not make a fuss. Keep your weapon ready. The envoy you brought is not as well intentioned as you might have thought. 
Have Ve'nari scan the area, then investigate whatever is found.	Korthia, the City of Secrets	We are on the threshold of attaining our desires, Maw Walker. Your grand waystone cannot be far off. Of course, my needs are much more modest. A bit of useful information here, a priceless relic there...I will survey the area to see if there is anything useful--or hazardous--nearby. Then we can proceed. 
Speak to Bolvar to relive the victory against the Jailer.	The Jailer's Defeat	At long last, we have thwarted the Jailer's schemes. Both the Forge of Afterlives and Azeroth's world-soul have been restored, and the Shadowlands can now begin to recover from the anima drought. I know it is in your nature to push ever forward. But this was a monumental victory, and it deserves a moment of reflection. 
Collect Stonebreaker Mallets to destroy crypt doors in search of Death Lotus Powder.	Crypt Crashers	There's one more thing I forgot to mention. Apologies, George. The mirror, once complete, is inherently cursed by design. You need to locate my Death Lotus Powder. It was in one of the crypts in Archivam... I cannot recall which one. I'm afraid you may have to brute force this one, George. 
Travel to Ardenweald, locate Tabithia, and recover the Otherworldly Egg.	Asset Extraction	Hey, it's my good pal George! Listen, I'm in a bit of a bind here. I've been trying to negotiate a deal with the broker Au'larrynar and he needs a little something, a job done before he'll accept. The deal is he had an associate who went missing with a rare item. He's asked that I... we... locate and return the missing property. The associate was last seen in Ardenweald. I know, strange place, way too bright for me. But, I... we... really need this deal to go through! So, you ready to go? 
Defend Revendreth by completing Daily Quests and World Quests, looting treasures, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in the Sanguine Depths and Halls of Atonement dungeons.	A Call to Revendreth	We all serve the greater purpose here, even those in Revendreth that we may not agree with. We take souls to them in need of a harsher form of cleansing, and it is just. Yet Sire Denathrius has gone too far, and now seeks to control all of the Shadowlands. We have friends there, amongst the Venthyr. Aid them, and put their enemies to rest. The Word of the Archon is with you. 
Report back to Bolvar in Haven.	Safe Haven	Let us return to Zereth Mortis. You should report back to Bolvar and tell him of what we have accomplished. We may have achieved this victory, but there is still much to be done. 
Jump from the tower.	Trust Fall	Let us ponder the meaning of the Archivist's last words: ""Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fall.""Hmm. It could be reference to the Volume of Victory. That is the most well-known of all the writings said to be kept in this tower. That book is priceless, George. I mean that almost literally. We must do whatever is necessary to find it! But, uh... What do you suppose ""brave enough to fall"" refers to? 
	Forged in Secret	 
Bring the Sheep Soul to Choofa in the Heart of the Forest.	Sheep Soul	<The Sheep Soul is calm and stalwart. The shape of the sheep will be yours to call upon.> 
Collect the Rumors of Favor from Chalice Couriers in the Chalice District.	Overhead Intelligence	The Countess knows the fates and goings-on of every noble in Revendreth. It is the best way to keep them in her debt. However, she has a dark secret. Despite what she may say... she was once mortal. We will need to find where she keeps her sinstone. No easy feat, of course. We will need to gather some intel. The venthyr of the Chalice District are constantly gossiping. Collect their letters from the couriers until you learn something of interest. 
Travel with Ve'nari to the site of the new landmass within the Maw	Mysteries of the Maw	The Maw is changing, mortal. And with change comes opportunity. The Jailer has pulled a realm that was hidden deep within the Shadowlands into the Maw. It is a location of some interest to me, but I do not wish to approach it alone. The Mawsworn are swarming the area, you see. There must be something of value that they seek. I have a safe enclave nearby. Accompany me there and I may be able to help you find that waystone you're looking for. Do we have a deal? 
Follow Laurent and collect Mirror Fragments.	Foraging for Fragments	Forgive me. I don't mean to appear ungrateful, but my mirror fragments are missing. I shouldn't be surprised, really. They're quite powerful and I'm sure the miscreants out here would be happy to get their hands on them. Nonetheless, I will not let this deter me. The Master sends his stone servants to smash any mirrors erected in this ward, so we should have no trouble finding fragments nearby. 
Defeat Sire Denathrius.	The Master of Lies	Once more unto the fangs of death himself, sword drawn, peace with oblivion made. Let us meet death together and bring him low. Be sure you are prepared for a sustained assault. For once we reveal ourselves, there will be no stopping. When you are ready, direct the Focal Mirror at the gates of Castle Nathria. Let us descend upon our burning enemies with ferocity and swiftness of action. 
Speak with Ta'meri in Oribos.	Coins for the Ferryman	Your side of the deal is done, Maw Walker. Now for your payment. My cartel runs a ferry that travels between Oribos and Tazavesh. Its purpose is to transport cargo, but as in all things, there are... exceptions. Take this coin to Ta'meri and you will be provided safe passage to the market. What happens after that is up to you.<Ta'oku bows, uttering a sound that seems almost like a chuckle.> 
Complete 3 World Quests in Ardenweald.	Aiding Ardenweald	Ardenweald has long been one of our closest companions in the shepherding and nurturing of souls. Now they are beset by many foes, and we will not allow them to fall! Make haste to their forested lands, and with the blessing of the Archon upon you, serve a glorious purpose. Stand with them in their time of need, a gilded shield, a reminder that they are not alone! Bastion stands with them, and with us, they will never falter! 
Report to the Primus.	The Meaning of Wrath	I will gather my forces and dispense a portion to Korthia immediately. I will also see to it that they are provided the tools Baroness Vashj and Kael'thas were able to conjure so that we might further defend against nathrezim incursions. Other duties require my attention before I can descend on Korthia. I must secure Dominance Keep against further infiltrators. I suppose the Primus will want an update. You may tell him you were successful. 
Return 6 Motivated Automa to Firim.	A Matter Of Motivation	Giants litter these sands, mortal. But I believe we can revitalize them. The smaller automa that are hiding in the desert can be utilized here. Use my Motivator to rally them to our cause. If we can gather enough, their energy can replenish these defeated behemoths to bolster our forces. Return as many as you can to me, and we will put them to work! 
Charge a Depleted Automa Core by draining slain wild creatures in the Arrangement Index.	Core Competency	The poor thing. The sacred should not be disturbed, but... will the elders judge us if we help it survive? This is preservation, not interference....I hope. We can power it back up. Use this depleted core as a conduit. Perhaps the larger wild animates in the nearby sands have enough energy to charge it. 
Activate the Crest of Ascension.	A New Age	With the final empowerment in place, our renewed Crest of Ascension stands bolstered by the might of not just Bastion, but all covenants. Soon new Ascended will grace these halls once more as aspirants finish their long-awaited trials. None of this would be possible without your aid, Maw Walker. The honor of activating the Crest at last is yours. 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Lurking In The Shadows	 
Prepare Houndmaster Loksey for the Penitent Hunt in the Grove of Terror.	Dread Priming	Sire Denathrius has requested I help you prepare for the hunt. Every hunter must help prepare a soul here in the Grove of Terror. I have a stubborn soul here who's been quite uncooperative, Houndmaster Loksey. His time has come to be hunted.<The Fearstalker hands you a set of Hopebreaker Soul Chains.>Demoralize him. We can't let him leave here with any hope. The hunt is meant to break the souls so they become less... resistant to the processes of Revendreth. 
Meet Darion Mograine outside Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.	Shadowlands: A Chilling Summons	The time has come, Mechanic. Highlord Bolvar Fordragon requests your presence atop Icecrown Citadel. Meet me in Orgrimmar, and I will take you to him. I would not keep him waiting. 
Retrieve 4 Korthian Artifacts from the Mawsworn.	Looting the Looters	<The Mawsworn was carrying a Korthian artifact. It's unclear what the enemy wants with such relics, but you suspect the attendants in Keeper's Respite would want to see them returned.> 
Bring the memory back to Stitcher Au'phes in Oribos.	The Vessels of the Thread	You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of thread work. But perhaps you have more to learn. Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you. Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way. What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact. 
Report back to the Primus in Korthia.	New Sigil of the Kyrian	With a future of kinship and devotion secured for Bastion, a new sigil is born to represent our path forward. Please report all that you have done to the Primus. When he is ready, we will deliver the sigil to him. Let us hope he can use it to thwart the Jailer's plan and save the Shadowlands. 
Speak with the prisoner and learn of his situation.	Deep Within	Who... who are you? Have you come to extract more of my memories? I'm afraid there aren't any useful ones left, save for the memories of my imprisonment. Or perhaps you're here for something else? 
Bring the Brutosaur Soul to Lady Muunn in the Heart of the Forest.	Brutosaur Soul	<The Brutosaur Soul is loyal and valiant. The shape of the brutosaur will be yours to call upon.> 
Report to Tal-Galan at Keeper's Respite in Korthia.	Korthia Awaits	Ready yourself, George. Our allies await your arrival in Korthia. 
Slay 15 masked night fae in Shimmerbough.	Blooming Villains	Something stinks, traveler. The air to the west is rotten with malice. Shimmerbough has long been a peaceful way station along the Path of Rebirth. The faeries there delight in revelry and celebration. But now their glade has fallen silent. Scouts bring reports of the strange masked night fae. I know little other than that they are a threat. For the sake of Ardenweald, they must be eliminated. Slay any you encounter. 
Search Haven for information about Firim.	Seeking the Unknown	If the Elders will not assist us, we must find someone who will. That other Enlightened, Firim... he was much more interested in the automa. He said he was estranged from his kin. Someone in Haven must know something about him. Look around the camp for clues about Firim's whereabouts. I will try again to convince the Elders to talk. 
Witness the Winter Queen empower the Heart of the Forest.	Growing in Power	Wonderful news, George! You have gathered enough Anima. The Queen is now able to empower the Heart of the Forest! 
Accompany Lady Moonberry into the Heart of the Forest and take part in the ceremony.	The Boon of Shapes	<Moonberry looks serious.>Mortal though you are, you have chosen to become one of our champions. While you uphold our cause, we are obligated to extend hospitality to you within our sacred hall and grant you certain boons. As a member of the Court of Night, I can bestow our powers on chosen mortals. George, Mechanic of Azeroth, I bid you welcome to the first tree, Tirna Achiad, the Heart of the Forest. Please, follow me. 
Obtain an Engorged Gorm Larva from Tred'ova in the Mists of Tirna Scithe.	Trading Favors: Tirna Scithe	The gorm devour anything in their path when left unchecked. We have sold more than a few of them as both pets and weapons. You do not want to see what a world looks like when they are introduced to it and allowed to infest. Or perhaps, mhm, you do? For some, that is entertainment. It is difficult for us to explore Ardenweald with things as they are at this time. A fat, healthy gorm larva would fetch a fine price on the markets. I trust my meaning is understood? 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Ineffable Skitterer	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Attend the Countess's soiree and speak with guests to uncover the traitorous house.	Mix, Mingle, and Meddle	Once the party begins, I will be occupied with a plethora of nobles that wish to cling to my side. This is why I need you to mingle. Speak with the attendees and see if you can determine which house is conspiring against me. Be warned, invited guest or not, these aristocrats can smell an outsider. You won't receive a warm welcome from everyone. 
	Remedial Lessons	 
Collect 3 Culexwood Branches.	Gifts of the Forest	These gorm have gone out of control! We need to stop them. I have a plan, but I cannot do it on my own. We lure the gormlings to the Banks of Life by using special totems that are drained of their anima. If you can retrieve the wood required for the totem, I can prepare the ritual. Take these pipes. Find the Culex trees growing on the banks and play a song for them. You will recognize them by their pale green leaves. The wood must be given freely for the ritual to work. 
1 Compilation Nodule and 10 Composition Motes recovered.	Motes of Knowledge	The creatures of Untamed Verdure are ingesting everything in sight. They have consumed our Compilation Nodule, and the Composition Motes needed for compilation. We Jiro require these resources. This area is too hazardous for unprotected Jiro operation. Please help us reclaim our resources. Mai Obet will assist you. 
Collect 10 Ephemeral Draught.	The Secret Ingredient	At times, even the most seasoned kyrian may have difficulty meditating. Recently, such problems have become increasingly common. There is a special draught crafted from our purest waters that can be used to focus the mind. I believe it may prove useful in our work here as well, perhaps as a catalyst for more potent reactions. Will you gather some? Move swiftly, for the liquid becomes unstable once removed from our sacred pools. 
Kill Inquisitor Devaki and find out how he is trying to track Ve'nari.	Rule 4: Make A List	I've discovered that one of the Jailer's inquisitors is attempting to devise a method to track my movements. Clearly, that is a problem for me... and by extension, it is a problem for you. The inquisitor has risen to the top of my list of potential threats. In the past, I would have had to deal with him myself. But now... I have a business partner. Put an end to him, yes? And if you can, determine exactly how he intended to track me. 
Find Cudgelface on the Bridge of Temptation leading to the Eternal Terrace.	Invitation for the Countess	The Countess, Harvester of Desire. Her wits are sharper than most swords. While I have never seen her carry a weapon, you must assume she is never unprotected. Her mansion mirrors my own, on the Northeastern side of Castle Nathria. Her dominion was that of the Castle Ward, and it is her authority that keeps the nobles in line. She will appreciate a secret message. I will send a dredger ahead with a plan to infiltrate her party. Meet him on the Bridge of Temptation. Good luck. 
Enshrine the Spear of Kalliope in its rightful place at Elysian Hold.	Rightful Resting Place	You have truly proven yourself a hero in the eyes of those who are its absolute judge. I thank you for giving me the honor of holding it, even for this briefest moment. However, it is only proper that you be the one to enshrine the spear at it's rightful resting place. Let us meet at Elysian Hold where you can do the honors. 
Speak with the Winter Queen.	Report to the Queen	Mueh'zala's forces are routed, and it's only a matter of time before the Wild Hunt completely purges them from Ardenweald. But something tells me that the struggle between Bwonsamdi and Mueh'zala is far from over. That creepy little mask has gone silent...You should hurry back to the Heart of the Forest and report to the Winter Queen. She will decide what we do next. 
Stand before the Court of Harvesters and pledge your loyalty.	The Court of Harvesters	Partnerships such as ours will be key to Revendreth's revival. As Harvesters, we have the ability to extend our powers to mortals, though the decision must be unanimous. To that extent, the court has gathered and is awaiting your arrival. Let's not keep them waiting. 
	State of Decay	 
Follow the anima trail to the next conduit.	The Anima Trail	So the Jailer seeks the Primus's sigil. We must beat the Mawsworn to it. To open the vault, we need to power it with anima. You helped the Bonesmith repair the first conduit. The trail of anima in front of us leads to the next. If we can activate it, then there should be enough anima flowing into Korthia to get us inside the vault. Come, we must make haste! 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Unsuccessful Prototype Fleetpod	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Gather the Envoys and ride to Dominance Gate.	Convoy of the Covenants	A new sigil for the Venthyr would require all seven medallions to forge. The Primus was correct. The person we need is the Stonewright. Her grievances against the Unseen could fill a library and she holds the last of the medallions we need. I believe you and I are long overdue in convincing her to join our cause. I will make the arrangements. We shall go properly this time, with gifts and diplomacy. You should warn Chelra, she will want to arrange an escort. 
Retrieve 5 pieces of Shredded Scroll from Rotbriar spriggans and a Tattered Binding from a Major Hex to create a Sealed Scroll of Soul Rot.	Curses!	Oh, dear me, this is terrible! Just terrible! I know precisely which awful curse afflicts that poor soul! But these damnable spriggans keep stealing my scrolls, scattering them all over and ripping them apart! Now the falls are overrun with all manner of dangerous magic! The spriggans have the pieces of the scroll you need. Gather them along with a binding from one of the major hexes, and you can put it all back together. 
Bring the Naughty Story to Archivist Dreyden in the Grove of Memory.	A Naughty Story	<You have held this book for less than five minutes and it has already escaped once, bitten you twice and somehow managed to steal some gold. This is not what you were expecting from a ""Naughty Story"" but then again, maybe you should have. You bind the book closed so it will hopefully cause a minimum of mischief. Time to bring it to Archivist Dreyden.> 
Meet Mikanikos at the Citadel of Loyalty.	Citadel of Loyalty	The medallions, the source of magic the crown focuses, are still bent to the will of Denathrius. Forge cannot solve this. Citadel of Loyalty can. Taken over by the Forsworn in recent times. If we can get the crown to the temple, we can break the loyalty to the medallion's former master. 
Recharge the Netherstar, then bring it to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	The Netherstar	<You recognize this relic from the Archivists' Codex. The power source is nearly empty. However, it could be restored with exposure to raw, unfiltered anima. Nearby fissures would do the trick.> 
Return to the Primus in Korthia.	Inform the Primus	George, return to Korthia and tell the Primus that the Winter Queen's sigil has been restored. 
Accompany Danica to the Great Mead Hall and inform Odyn of Helya's actions.	A Hate-Hate Relationship	When the first of my sisters went missing, we were concerned. Those sent to find her did not return. Nor did the next. What we have discovered is a dreadful betrayal by someone we once trusted. Come, we must tell Odyn what we have witnessed in the Maw. His wrath will be great. 
Use the Containment Orb to send 8 Imprisoned Essences to Ve'nari. Suggested Players [3]	Guaranteed Delivery	<The broker appears to be from Cartel Ve. Perhaps they were once an associate of Ve'nari. Clutched in their hand is a list of items and a containment orb. Finishing this broker's task and sending the items back to Ve'nari will surely earn you some compensation.> 
Deliver this part to Rathan in Butchers Block.	Construct Part: Indomitable Hide	<This could be used to construct a powerful abomination. Perhaps Rathan will know how we can use it.> 
Return to the Primus at Korthia.	Victory in Our Name	With Helya and Vyraz taken care of, we have achieved a major victory against the Mawsworn today. It is also a showing of what the combined might of the Shadowlands looks like. We should return to Korthia before something else arises. 
Defend Laurent and Simone from Stone Legion attackers.	Mirror Making, Not Breaking	Denathrius does not allow mirrors to be erected within the ember ward. His stone servants shatter anything that so much as glints. I need you to remain vigilant as I make this mirror. I have no doubt that the Master's minions will try to stop us. Are you ready? 
Search Sinfall for any signs of Prince Renathal.	In the Ruin of Rebellion	Well, here we are -- Sinfall. Last I saw, the Master was dragging Prince Renathal and his most loyal followers here in a prison convoy. However, this is a forbidden place, wrapped in rumors and mystery. I heard it was once the workshop of Denathrius, where he performed dark experiments. Intriguing to be sure, but we are here to find Renathal. Search below, but proceed with caution. I will send word for the Accuser to make her way here with what allies she can muster. 
Assist Master Smith Helgar at the Forge of Odyn.	Fury Given Voice	I will answer this attack upon my val'kyr with relentless fury! You have a vital role to play in this, Mechanic. You will muster the courage that you have demonstrated this day to lure my Eye to battle. But first, a simpler task ... the creation of the horn that will summon my wrath. Master Smith Helgar will guide you. 
Collect a sampling of snacks from across the Ember Ward for Stonehead.	Snacks for Stonehead	<Stonehead has amassed a wide variety of half-eaten oddities. He'd certainly appreciate you bringing some new, creative snacks for him to try.> 
Block Athanos' Power Stomp 6 times, then capture his memory.	Back to Him	Even with Humility's Guard in hand, if you are to convince Athanos to join the Path of Ascension once more then you must prove yourself a worthy adversary. Enter the ring and wield the spear against him. Even with its power you cannot hope to defeat him, but it should be able to parry his mighty stomp. Thwart his assault for long enough, and he will surely allow you to capture his memory. 
Bring the Alpaca Soul to Lady Muunn in the Heart of the Forest.	Alpaca Soul	<The Alpaca Soul is wary and alert. The shape of the alpaca will be yours to call upon.> 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Cliffs of Bastion	 
Return to Prince Renathal.	Our True Purpose	We are grateful for this partnership, Maw Walker. With your help, Renathal will lead us into a new era, one that will see Revendreth reclaim its true purpose. Return to him now so that the real work can begin. 
Slay 15 Mawsworn in Scholar's Den.	Vengeance for Korthia	While opening the vault is our priority, I must ask a favor. When Korthia was pulled into the Maw, my people were terrified. We fled to the area you see before you, a place of peace called the Scholar's Den. The Mawsworn soon descended upon us. Most of my kind were slaughtered. Others were taken captive. If I could claim vengeance myself, I would. But I... I am ill-equipped for battle. Not like you. Please. Show these monsters that their defilement of Korthia will not stand! 
Riding Kbato, defeat the Mawsworn forces in the Endless Sands and open the way to the Crypts of the Eternal.	Knocking On Death's Door	This is it, mortal. The forces you have assembled should be enough to break through the Mawsworn and reach the Crypts. Getting inside, however, will require more effort. The Mawsworn have barricaded the entrance. Kbato will carry you into battle. Eliminate the Mawsworn, and destroy the devices that power the barrier. 
Fly with Twigin to the necropolis's apex and plug in the Runic Keystone.	Keys to the Ruin	At last, our target is within reach. The necropolis rests above us, moored to this platform by a necrotic restraining bolt. Twigin can fly you to the apex of the necropolis. It will be ours to command once you insert this keystone. We will prepare for our departure. Rejoin us when you are done. Victory will soon be ours. 
Witness the Crest of Ascension become empowered by the Temple of Loyalty.	Our Realm Reclaimed	Though Forsworn still fight across Bastion, the Temple of Loyalty is ours, and with it our realm. We will have to stay diligent to maintain control of all of the temples, and much remains to be decided with the fate of our fallen brethren, but today is a day of great victory. Join me at the Crest of Ascension, and witness its final empowerment. 
	Further Gelatinous Research	 
Aid Bastion by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Bastion dungeons.	Bolstering Bastion	You are no aspirant, but I welcome any aid that Oribos might bring us in these dire times. Please, aid our people in any way you can. With anima in low supply and the insidious Forsworn encroaching from all sides, there is no shortage of trials to overcome. Do this for us, and I will see to it myself that our almighty Archon hears of your deeds in service of the kyrian. Mark well my words, and follow the path. 
Find Finnan's Lucky Mallet.	Craftsman Needs No Tools	Oh, I am quite all right! There's just one little thing....One of these fiends made off with my lucky mallet! I simply cannot leave my mallet behind. I do not even use it much any more, but it is quite lucky and I always keep it with me. Please, I cannot even think about building anything without it. Do keep an eye out for it, will you? 
Place four of Renathal's Banners at Darkwall Tower.	Common Ground	Now that we have a stronghold from which to operate, we need to begin the next stage of my plan to wrest control of Revendreth from the Master. We must convince the Court of Harvesters to convene. We must not have them come here, though. It would be suicide. Go to my old fortress, Darkwall Tower, and place these banners at the four most distant points of the tower. This will ensure the power of the Harvesters and the Master will not be able to interfere with a neutral meeting. 
Guide Temel through the Caretaker's Manor and deliver Prince Renathal's message to the Tithelord.	Harvester of Envy	Thank you for meeting us at a minimum safe distance from the Caretaker's Manor. There are enough people around here that may still find the idea of me in a cage to be worth the trouble. It is too dangerous for you or I to speak to the Tithelord. He is too impulsive and eager to please Denathrius. I recommend we send Temel. The stone fiend is a common messenger for Revendreth and few aside from a handful of observers will bat an eye at his arrival. Just shove him when you are ready. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Bastion.	A Calling in Bastion	Our forces are weakened by doubt and our temples are under assault. If we are to aid the rest of the Shadowlands, we must begin here, in Bastion. Travel the golden fields and root out evil wherever you may find it. In time, we will rebuild our forces and our anima stores, and stand tall once more. Today, you walk the path of courage--it is your calling. Show our people that doubt will not fester here. 
Deliver Wilderling Saddle to Reldorn in Keeper's Respite.	Wilderling Saddle	<As you slipped off of the escaped wilderling's back, it shook its saddle off at your feet. It reluctantly left your side as the night fae led it back to Keeper's Respite. Reldorn in Keeper's Respite might know what to make of this gesture.> 
Gather 10 Suspicious Papers.	Xy Are You Doing This?	We cannot see them, but I am certain this is where Cartel Xy has established their base. Something must have drawn Xy to this area of Zereth Mortis specifically, and we must discover what it is if we are to protect our friends here. Their cloaks do not cover their supplies very well. See what information you can gather from their belongings. 
Search enemies or discarded bottles in the Dredgewood for an armor dye.	Dredging up a New Look	If ye look around the muck pool I am sure you will find an armor dye. It might be nice to have the option to dye me belt a different color. 
Go through the mirror and face the Countess.	Sins of the Past	The Countess built her reputation on being a native venthyr, never a soul. Revealing her sinstone to the world would be catastrophic. This is the leverage we need for the information we seek. She will tell us where Alwin is. Where the seal is. This mirror leads to her estate. I will follow behind you as backup, but the kyrian shall wait here. Don't let her threaten you. You hold the power. 
Slay Runemaster Mavrok.	Rule 6 Addendum: Save Me At Any Cost	You! You, there! Wait! You are the infamous Maw Walker, yes? I have heard much about you. Please, help me! My compatriots have been drained of their essence. The Mawsworn are using it to fashion their foul runes. One of them bound me here, and I am sure to be next on his list. You must slay him in order to free me! I can make it worth your while. I have collected a fair amount of stygia during my time in the Maw. It is yours, all of it, if you save me! 
Hunt down the Gorm Matriarch.	One Big Problem	We must go after Master Sha'lor. Tirna Vaal needs him! And I... I...I will report to the droman. They must know that Sha'lor is in danger. Then, I will enter the burrows myself from the south and help you defeat it. For now, see what you can find. I refuse to believe that he is gone. That monster will know the fury of a vorkai. 
	Specter Of War: Visectus	 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Scarlet Helicid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Collect the Depleted Wildseed, place it in the gormling pen, and coax gormlings to eat it.	Nothing Goes to Waste	The gormlings are industrious creatures. Naturally, they are our source of gorm gris. Gormlings are cute, small, and hungry, like Gloober here! Except he is not hungry right now, because I just fed him. Look at that little belly...<Ahem>. I digress. Gormlings will be drawn to consume anything that is not brimming with anima. They find it simply delicious. Take that wildseed there, and bring it into their pen. Then, see if you can get the gormlings to feast upon it! 
Meet with Courier Araak.	A Curious Invitation	Psst. You there. Yeah, you. You that Maw Walker them fangs been going on about? Huh. I figured you'd be bigger. Anyway, the Taskmaster wants to ahhh ... ""extend his compliments and an invitation to visit his workings."" That's a fancy word for a bunch of rocks me and my mates are diggin' up. If you're keen an' all that, pop down to Feeder's Thicket and meet with the fang's courier, Araak. He'll get you sorted right out. 
Approach Matyas to start the duel. Assist Nadjia when Matyas cheats.	It's a Trap	At last, I will have my vengeance! I am certain Matyas will flee again if he sees me first so you will need to confront him on my behalf, friend. Then, while he's distracted, I will engage him. At that point, your obligation as my second is a formality. You must assure Matyas does not dishonor the duel and cheat. When he inevitably does, I expect you'll help me defeat him. He's just through the portcullis there. 
Collect 3 Conduction Remnants.	Remnants of the First Ones	Some evidence of the Mawsworn's destruction may remain in Provis Esper. Recovering that evidence will provide some clue as to how to follow this Jailer. Let us hunt together. I will know the sign of the First Ones's magic when we are in its vicinity. 
Find Shandris Feathermoon within Oribos.	Daughter of the Night Warrior	In my dreams, I see many things. Elven souls tortured in the Maw. A warrior of the night consumed by vengeance. And... Ardenweald's destruction. These visions are ever shifting... ever vague. But I believe Tyrande Whisperwind is key to saving the night elves, as well as this realm. Shandris Feathermoon, Tyrande's daughter, is touched by dreams as well. Even now, she travels to the Eternal City. Find her. If anyone can reach the heart of Tyrande, it is her. 
Enter the Cradle of Nascence.	A Mysterious Voice	So much destruction. The devourers are insatiable. I hope the creature we heard is not badly hurt. This door is not going to open normally. Perhaps we can force our way through together! Whatever is on the other side needs our help. 
Use the deathstone to travel to the Other Side.	On De Other Side	Ay dere, George... It be your ol' friend, Bwonsamdi! I hear ya be workin' for da Winter Queen. Seems ya be makin' quite a name for yaself! Ardenweald be in grave danger, but da Queen... well, she be too proud to deal with ol' Bwonsamdi. Ya wanna save da forest, mon? Come visit me on da Other Side. I gonna be waitin' for ya... 
Kill 12 Cartel Xy agents just outside of Haven.	Broker Decloaker	Do you sense a shift in the air? They may be hidden, but Cartel Xy is near. Fortunately, the devices they use to cloak themselves are familiar to me. Here; take this. Place it on the ground and it will reveal nearby agents... for a time. Stop them, even if you must take their lives. 
Weaken Briarbane venthyr and then offer them a sinstone.	Offer of Freedom	Just as I was, some of the Briarbane venthyr you encounter will have been compelled to serve Matyas. They likely will not want to fight you, but will have no choice. Once they are injured, they may be willing to pause to see if one of the sinstones you recovered earlier is theirs. Free those you can. The use of a sinstone to compel others isn't fair. 
Recover Renathal's Allies from Torghast, Tower of the Damned.	Torghast, Tower of the Damned	My allies were taken into the Tower of the Damned, and so we must follow. I do not think we must venture deep into those halls, which is good as I do not believe either of us is in shape for a fight like that. Come, let us find our way to one of the most dangerous towers in all of existence. 
Use the Soul Mirror to aid Uther in reliving his past.	Step Into the Light	It is as I feared. This fragment of Uther's soul was darkened by the mourneblade that slew him. His memories are shattered and twisted. For Uther to move past his pain, to move past his grief, he must experience his past once again. But he does not have to do this alone. Using my soul mirror, we can aid Uther in walking through these memories. He can then come to terms with the emotions they contain. We must help him see past the distortions and understand the truths they hold. 
Join Kleia and Pelagos in the Meditation chamber and face the memories of your past.	RSVP: Kleia and Pelagos	Oh, how wonderful! Thank you for the invitation to the Ember Court. We were just going to go cleanse ourselves with a meditation. That will be even more necessary if we are to travel soon. Care to join us? 
Use an Angry Needler Nest to weaken and kill Herald Gkeca, Herald Throgtu, and Herald Duarri.	That's Going to Sting	<Niya speaks loudly to be heard over the buzzing coming from the collection of needler nests behind her.>I've caught Moonberry trying to steal these nests for her pranks over ten times already! The other faeries said I was crazy to bring the needlers out here. Too wild! Too unpredictable! But that's exactly why we need them. Lord Herne's scouts report powerful Heralds among our enemy's forces. Take one of these nests, and use it to surprise the Heralds! 
Collect Volumes of Victory.	A Complete Set	This is only volume one? We can't just take the first volume. A rare item like this is only useful if it's in a complete set! Grab as many of the other volumes as you can, I will have to prepare a larger expedition to remove all of these volumes. 
Meet with Louison	Sure Bet	You appear to have great profit potential. There are many interested parties willing to bet upon your performance in the Theater of Pain. Go now, Louison will arrange your appearance. 
Use Chordy to locate and collect 10 valuable salvage in Revendreth.	Things They Leave Behind	Chordy bored. Chordy want to go on adventure! You want to go too, yes? Pale people in tall buildings have many shinies and luckydos. We go there and find some for ourselves! You ready to go? 
Steal an Assassin's Soulcloak and dispel 4 Runes of Warding within Perdition Hold in The Maw. Suggested Players [3]	Words of Warding	The towering citadel in the distance is protected by perilous walls, but its greatest dangers cannot be seen with mortal eyes. The Mawsworn have placed invisible runes of warding throughout Perdition Hold. These traps have caught many intruders unaware. The runes can be dispelled, but only if you can see them. I believe one of their soulcloaks should give you the sight you require. Good luck. 
Ask Ve'nari about the location of a second waystone.	Link to the Maw	The Fatescribe is certain that a second waystone has emerged in the Maw. It falls to you to locate it. I will create an anchor here in Oribos that links to your anima. Once you attune yourself to the waystone, this anchor will be bound to it. If you are successful, the covenants will be able to send their forces inside and safely leave the Maw again. Use what resources you have within the Maw to find this waystone. Good luck, mortal. May the Purpose guide us all. 
Rescue 6 Tortured Attendants in Seeker's Quorum.	Rescued from Torment	The Mawsworn are not only killing those they find in the Seeker's Quorum. They are interrogating the survivors. We should help save those we can. It's possible one of them might have seen the Fatescribe. 
Retrieve a Wreath of Night's Veil Flowers from backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater.	Getting Backstage	The next thing we need to prepare the vessel is a set of Night's Veil Flowers. We use these flowers in our ceremonies, but since the drought we've just used them as props in our plays. There are certainly some backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater. I bet Moonberry is there for the rehearsal of their next play. As a bonus, this will work out quite nicely for me to get revenge on her.<Willowblossom flashes a wicked grin.> 
Follow Hanoa the Exile and listen to her story.	Zovaal's Grasp	I remember this metal. I saw it when I was touched by Maw magic. When I was severed...I will show you where this happened. Follow me. I will tell you my story. 
Convince 10 Forsworn to return to the Path.	Rebuilding Faith	The Forsworn are lost, George. They are like ghosts, haunting the Temple of Loyalty. Nowhere else to go. Leaderless, purposeless, abandoned. We must show them that there is a path forward. Let me accompany you into the temple. Allow me to talk to them, speak to their sensibilities. Perhaps we can convince them to give Adrestes's new path a chance. 
Gather Catamelon Seeds and slay Overgrowth in the Catalyst Gardens.	Fruit of the Bloom	We never know when something new may emerge from the confluence of creation and energy. The Catalyst Gardens have blossomed with a new crop of fruit. Their seeds may have special properties, and we wish to understand them. Please gather what you can find, and make the gardens safer for the future. 
Speak to Uther in Oribos to escort Sylvanas to the Arbiter.	Prisoner of Interest	With the Jailer defeated, we must now turn our attention to healing the wounds he inflicted upon the Shadowlands. That process begins with Sylvanas Windrunner. Though she proved instrumental to our victory, the terrible atrocities she committed have been neither forgotten nor forgiven. She is to face the new Arbiter's judgment in Oribos. Uther awaits you in the Ring of Fates. Together, you will escort Sylvanas to the Crucible. 
Travel to the Deserted Overlook.	One Half of the Equation	The Primus's theory about the language of the First Ones has borne out. Still, it may not be enough. While the Primus finalizes his plans, let us go deep into the Endless Sands to find pieces of this power to infuse the helm. Darion, Taelia, and I will meet you there to help with the Mawsworn. 
	Muck It Up	 
Assist with the ritual and infuse the Shards of Domination.	What Makes Us Strong	I wish that I knew of this place sooner. Where terrible darkness could be purged from oneself, memories examined and expunged...I am willing to do whatever it takes to help defeat Zovaal, no matter the cost. This is the only way. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Adorned Vombata	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Speak to the inhabitants of Pilgrim's Grace.	Where There's a Pilgrim, There's a Way	If the remnants can be restored, someone in Pilgrim's Grace may know how. Begin with Elder Nirav. I hope he is willing to help. He seems anxious and distracted today. Find me in town when you are done. 
Bring the Hastily Wrapped Package to Ta'ruca at The Night Market in Revendreth.	The Night Market	<Dracho motions to keep your voice down.>I need some assistance, I promise you will be paid handsomely. At the edge of The Banewood lies some ruins. These ruins are home to a marketplace run by some brokers. They won't let me back there. Let's just say that my goods were deemed to not be up to their authenticity metrics. But you... you're a Maw Walker! Bring them this package and exchange it for some Surberries from Ardenweald. Just don't say I sent you. 
Return to Haven with Jaina and Baine.	Seeking Haven	I am at a loss. We have no way to follow Zovaal and Anduin. I'll open a portal back to Haven. We will discuss our next steps there. 
	Aspirant For a Day	 
Collect a sample of Banana Beef Pudding, 30 Aethereal Meat, and 20 Phantasmal Haunch. Then taste-test Stewart's concoction.	Ember Court: Divine Desserts	Recipes very important. Must not be lost! I learn new foods from many mortals, add to my book. Best way is taste some of thing so can know what is good. You teach recipe to me this way and bring me right ingredients so I cook too. Then taste yours, then taste mine. Helps me learn. I bring desserts to Ember Court. Fair, yes? 
Memorize Phrases in the Lexical Glade.	Cryptic Catalogue	This area is a repository of various texts. Hmmm? What do they say? I have no idea! I have dedicated myself to their catalogue and organization. This is more important than ever, with invaders destroying the balance in Zereth Mortis! We must preserve what we have found so far. You can help. Go into the glade and memorize the phrases there, then meet me down in the grotto. There is something in it that might help you test that helm of yours further. 
Speak to Theotar at the Eternal Forge. Then, reveal and destroy 5 Concealed Anima Siphons.	Right our Wrongs	General Kaal was sent here on a mission for Denathrius long ago. On that mission, they concealed anima siphons, making their presence impossible to detect, to limit the amount of anima this workshop could use. That destabilized this area. The Forsworn must have noticed this and exploited the weakness. These previous actions are in opposition to our goal. Take Theotar and destroy those siphons. 
Enter Torghast and explore the Twisting Corridors for any sign of Anduin Wrynn.	Signs of the Lion	Thanks to your efforts, Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and Baine Bloodhoof are safe. Yet so long as the Jailer holds any hero of Azeroth, I fear he has power over us all. It seems Anduin has been taken deeper into the tower than the others. Before I risk peering inside, you must make one last attempt to find him. You say the Jailer spoke of honing a weapon. I fear we are running out of time. Do not relent, George. Search the twisting corridors of Torghast for any sign of the Young Lion. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Ardenweald with your trainee.	Training Our Forces	Get up, trainee, you must get up! Look at this one! Needs much more training before we stand a fighting chance against our enemies. We have precious little time to build combat prowess these days, with so many foes at our backs. Take this one with you today, show them the ways of battle, and keep them safe from overwhelming odds. It is the only way we will make enough progress. 
Kill Tezulat the Annihilator.	Shadow's Fall	Despite our efforts, the Void stands strong. All of the forces of Bastion fight, and fall one by one...The Void cannot destroy us! They are led by Tezulat the Annihilator, scourge of a thousand realms. This day, his reign of terror will end! 
	Amateur Night	 
	Puzzling It Out	 
Retrieve 5 Sealed Containers from the Seeker's Quorum.	Sealed Secrets	Ah, Korthia. What secrets will be revealed? My associates have been hard at work, seeking to discover and procure various small items of interest throughout this broken land. Nothing of great importance, I assure you. They have secured those items in designated drop boxes, and those now await pickup in Seeker's Quorum. Don't worry, they are locked with an impenetrable seal to protect both the contents and the deliverer. Bring those sealed containers to me, and I will reward you handsomely. 
Recruit 15 animates.	Ani-Matter Animator	This area is rich with the remains of fallen soldiers... some of which still carry a spark of potential. I've created what I call the ""Ani-Matter Orb,"" with which you can reanimate the skeletal matter littered throughout the foundry. Let us see how many of the new animates would join our cause. As for those who don't... well, they should be quite accustomed to being slain by now. 
Return the Bone Carcass to Rathan at Butcher Block.	Corpse Run	There's work that needs doing 'round here. Mmmm hmmm. Spotted a big ol' carcass nearby. I aim to salvage it for parts. Figure you could come along, help me drag it to Rathan. He'd like that. Mmmm hmmm. Reckon I could even carry you there and back. You don't look too big. Ready to get going? 
Collect 5 Observational Records from the Windswept Aerie and Estuary of Awakening in Korthia.	Observational Records	Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time? As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in. The records from the Windswept Aerie and Estuary of Awakening should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb. And don't forget to look below ground! Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely. 
Look for signs of Tyrande Whisperwind.	On the Trail	In my visions, I witnessed Tyrande cutting through an endless storm of malevolent, nightmarish beings. Up ahead... is that...? Yes. I believe it is the very place I saw. Come. It may hold a clue as to where my mother has gone. 
Collect 30 Death Lotus Petals from Death Lotuses in the Redelav District.	Collecting Dust	If I know the Countess, which I do, her sinstone will have stronger protection than mere keys. She is quite fond of curses to protect her gateways. I am capable of creating a residue that should protect us, but it requires the petals of a specific flower you can find in Redelav gardens. Collect the petals of these flowers so that I may protect us from the dangers to come. 
Collect 30 Warped Flesh from devourers at Zovaal's Grasp.	Pound of Flesh	Automa remove threats to us. But there are no more automa. We must help ourselves. We need magic. Devourers ate the orb magic. Now they are warped and twisted. But also full of magic. Bring us devourer flesh. We will extract the magic. We will need it to defeat the devourers. 
Speak with the ""help"" in the village to find clues leading to the identity of the traitor.	Reason for the Treason	If you ask me, the attack on our convoy is suspicious. I told Mistress Mihaela that there must be a traitor in the village, but she isn't concerned. It's understandable. She's got to worry about gathering a new tithe. I've taken it upon myself to figure this out and I could use your help. I'm making discreet inquiries but I can't be seen speaking with the help. That's where you come in. You can be my assistant sleuth. 
Deliver Remornia to General Draven on the edge of Sinfall.	Redemption for the Redeemer	<Energies of death and innervation struggle to free themselves from the blade and consume you to your very core.><The bonds of warding placed on this blade by Prince Renathal will not hold for long. It should be taken to Sinfall where more permanent arrangements have been made for this prisoner.> 
Bring the memory back to Smith Au'berk in Oribos.	The Vessels of Metal	You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of smithing. But perhaps you have more to learn. Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you. Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way. What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact. 
Speak to Uther in Oribos to escort Sylvanas to the Enclave, then speak to Tal-Inara to be brought to the Crucible.	A Long Walk	The Arbiter awaits us. Though few are allowed within the Crucible, several who hail from Azeroth have been granted permission to bear witness as he passes judgment on Sylvanas. Yet we are far from the only ones affected by all the carnage Sylvanas has wrought. Her actions have brought pain and suffering to a great many. Screaming back at the Banshee as she passes might be their only chance to speak their mind. Let them be heard. 
Remove Kel'Thuzad from Maldraxxus.	The Third Fall of Kel'Thuzad	The time has come to purge Maldraxxus of treachery. Our armies are rallied. Our allies stand ready. The machine of war is in motion. We must win this battle, or all of the Shadowlands will be lost. 
Aid Maldraxxus by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Maldraxxus dungeons.	Rallying Maldraxxus	We need all the help we can get! It's taking all we have to hold our ground against the other houses, let alone gain any ground against them. Truth be told, your blade will be welcome anywhere. There are no shortage of battles to be won, foes to be toppled, or weary soldiers to be relieved. Help us regain control of Maldraxxus, and in the name of the Primus I will see you are amply rewarded. 
Deliver Lord Herne's report to the Winter Queen.	Unbroken Bonds	The Drust will pay for this foul curse that they've unleashed upon us. We have lost too many allies... too many friends to give up now. Even though we cannot save those who have fallen into possession, we can end their torment. I will instruct the hunt to put down all possessed they encounter. Please deliver this report to the Winter Queen. She must be told what we have learned. Thank you for your service, George. You are a true friend and guardian of Ardenweald. 
Don a disguise then search Dominance Keep for Huln Highmountain while avoiding the guards.	Hunting Huln	Huln is somewhere in the area, but the Stonewright isn't letting anyone in to her territory because of the recent, ah, troubles with Dreadlords. The guards won't let anyone in, and they're kicking out anyone who doesn't look like they belong. Luckily for Huln, Cudgelface and I came up with a foolproof plan! We just need to look like we belong and then we can ask around and find Huln. Easy! 
Complete the task for the Night Fae.	Prove Your Worth	You must prove your worth to us again George. We have not forgotten your betrayal. Yet we know you seek penance. This task should prove your willingness to rejoin our ranks. 
Read 3 Faded Epitaphs.	Memory of Honor	<A tablet sits embedded in the ground near a broken armor display. The runes on the epitaph conjure images of an ancient warrior in your mind. Clearly Maldraxxus honors the history of those who claimed great victories here. Similar memorials seem to be spread throughout the trench. Perhaps they can offer more insight into the denizens of this realm.> 
Confront the leader of the possessed fae in Shimmerbough.	Beneath the Mask	It's time to end this. When I first hid, I saw a dark shape on the northeast platform. I think that's their leader. Now that they can't perform any more rituals, we should be able to scare them off.<Primrose pauses for a moment.>I... I just wanted to say thank you. I never could have done this without your help. Now, let's drive out this enemy and retake the village! 
Find Gatamatos in the Golden Pasture and return him to his pedestal in Forgefire Outpost.	Phalynx Malfunction	As part of their training, I order my phalynx units to march the fields, keeping an eye on the wildlife and any goings-on. Unfortunately, last time they returned they were one fewer in number. Please search the Golden Pasture and search for the missing unit, then return it here. 
Forge a document to give Stonehead permission to leave his post for the Ember Court.	RSVP: Stonehead	Hi, best bud! Me no go party. <Stonehead shakes his head vigorously.>Got to stay for job! 
Place the Staff of the Primus upon the Statue of the Primus.	Staff of the Primus	The Staff of the Primus. The final piece of our leader's regalia. I can't deny the pride I feel in restoring this hall. You should feel the same sense of accomplishment. The statue awaits you, George. Bring glory to this realm. 
Examine the recovered recordings with Tal-Galan.	Secrets of the Vault	What fortune! You rescued the record keepers before the Mawsworn could steal their knowledge of the vault's relics. But their records are fragmented. Incomplete. I pray there's enough left to learn the truth. I will attempt to coalesce the knowledge that remains into a message. If the Purpose wills it, we will learn what the Jailer wants and to whom this item originally belonged. I must focus for a moment. Let me know when you are ready to begin. 
Defeat Scunner.	Bring Your Own	Scunner, a roiling mass of flesh and slime, has crawled out of the ruins of the House of Plagues. He emits a toxic vapor that impairs the functions of those who attempt to fight him. You can try it, Maw Walker, but it's doubtful you could hurt him on your own. Constructs are built to fight creatures like Scunner. So gather a force of them and eliminate the threat. 
Test the Broken Helm on an activated Lexicon Librarian and observe the results.	The Not-Scientific Method	The language of the First Ones is not static like most others. It evolves. Creatures like the sentries are more advanced than your average poultrid, obviously. Their more complex thought processes give them an innate resistance to the invaders' overriding magic. But you should not take my word for it. We can actually test this! In the grotto there is a librarian. Take those phrases you memorized and infuse them into it. Then try out your helm. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Revendreth.	A Calling in Revendreth	We got a lot of problems out there, boss. Big ones, little ones, really smelly ones, it's a lot. If we're gonna take on Denathrius, the first thing we gotta do is clean up right here in Revendreth. We get things cleaned up, yeah? Then we get some new allies, and we probably get our hands on some anima to boot. It's a call to action, it is. And it's important that we get started right away. Get on out there and get your boots muddy! 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Curious Crystalsniffer	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
	Spore Losers	 
Recover the valuable prisoner from within the Sanguine Depths.	Sanguine Depths: An Ally Within	There are whispers of a prisoner within these depths that may be of use to our cause. Whether this information can be relied upon is unknown. It is just as likely to be a trap, but still, we must investigate. We cannot afford to ignore an opportunity such as this. Venture into the Sanguine Depths and recover this valuable prisoner. 
Obtain glyphs from 6 Depleted Servitors around the Arrangement Index.	Junk's Not Dead	This automa has been hiding here! I suspect it will not be receptive to our help. I am hesitant to suggest this, but if the servitor were to associate you with this facility, it might be more amenable. If you have the means, copy the glyphs inscribed on similar automa outside. Those that the Maw have touched will be tainted, but I saw from my vantage point a few fallen automa in the sands with untarnished glyphs. 
Defend the obelisk at Provis Flora.	In Plain Sight	That sound! It came from the direction of the obelisk at Provis Flora. Impossible. We've let no one through. Hurry, George. Follow me! 
Recover the Medallion of Pride from Lord Chamberlain within the Halls of Atonement.	Halls of Atonement: Medallion of Pride	Our attempts at a parley were met with skepticism, at best. Acquiring the medallions may take more work than originally intended. However, not all hope is lost. I do believe that we can win over many of the Harvesters, and for those we cannot, a more direct approach will need to be taken. Lord Chamberlain falls into this latter category. His medallion must be taken by force. 
Drain anima from Gilded Cloudstriders 5 times.	Resource Drain	Usually repairs easy. Anima everywhere! Except drought means we can't just pull it from air. Other sources needed! Take this. Drain anima from cloudstriders. Not ideal, but desperate times. 
Bring the Unstable Explosive Orb to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Unstable Explosive Orb	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this device in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Collect Ritual Drafts from the three Architects.	Vaunted Vengeance	So you are from my baroness's home world? It must be a special one to breed such powerful individuals. The necromancers here have already begun preparation for Mor'Bitan's ritual. We should capitalize on their progress. Three necromancers act as the ritual's architects. Should we acquire their drafts, we could modify them to suit our purposes. Collect the plans... and feel free to savor your victims' torment. 
Speak to Pelagos to witness the judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner.	The Fate of Sylvanas	The time has come. Let this bring the dark saga of Sylvanas Windrunner to a close and herald a new dawn for the Shadowlands. Speak to me, and we will begin. 
Infuse the Lodestaff with anima.	An Infusion of Anima	Normally we would infuse the Lodestaff with energy from the Netherstar, another relic of note. Regrettably, that is not an option. But, in a pinch, anima is an acceptable substitute. Take the Lodestaff. Brandish it near recently slain devourers in the estuary below us. The staff should draw in and absorb their anima. 
Loot Sicklethorn Trickster Powder from Sicklethorn spriggans to dispel illusions on Conspicuous Objects and find Grubby.	Who Are You Fooling?	We cannot conduct the ritual without a very special guest. He's a silkstrider larva named Grubby and he's my best friend. Unfortunately, the nasty spriggans took him! What's worse is they cast illusions on what they steal, so no one can take it back! The spriggans often carry trickster powder. If you can take some of that stuff, I can reverse their illusions and rescue Grubby. 
Collect 10 Animyllis Blooms.	More Wings!	Idea! Maybe I am too heavy. Maybe need more wings! Glimmerflies have lovely wings. With correct bait and strong rope, perhaps we can catch. Please bring Animyllis Blooms. Their nectar is delicious for glimmerflies, and makes them drowsy! 
Rescue Pelagos.	A Soulbind In Need	Pelagos is my Soulbind. He is my brother, my closest friend, my mentor, and my student. He knows me completely, and I him. It is a bond stronger than any other. That he now struggles is a torment to me, but I am forbidden from intervening. An aspirant must succeed or fail on their own merits, or the trial is forfeit. I am bound by this law... but you are not. Please bring Pelagos back to me. This will not be his last trial. Not when he may finally have a chance. 
Travel to the Maw and rescue Lost Souls.	The Lost of Teldrassil	I learned that Sylvanas burned Teldrassil. I felt my heart break for the night elves. And that was only the beginning. We know now that the souls lost that day did not go to their intended rest. But you have the power to begin to correct that, Maw Walker. If you find yourself in the Maw, look for any of those lost. Please, bring them home. 
Locate Zovaal's Vault.	Full of Surprises	You continue to surprise me Maw Walker, your presence here is most unexpected! Since we are both here, I believe we should work together. The Jailer has a vault full of valuables, somewhere in this rift. Locate it for me, or bring it here to be opened and we'll share the wealth together! 
Grapple with the spirit's vision of their origin. If you leave the Vision, interact with a Dreamer's Vision portal in Dreamshrine Basin to enter again.	Visions of the Dreamer: Origins	The spirit within the wildseed dreams of her birth and youth, in the primordial days of her world. Go to the first Dreamshrine outside of Hibernal Hollow. Meditate at the shrine, and soothe this vision of how her life began. 
Collect 30 Shimmerflight Quills from flying beasts.	Where There's a Quill...	In times long past, Aspirants trained against the fauna of Bastion. The creation of the Centurions rendered such unstructured progression obsolete. The many flying denizens of this realm are known for their quills. They are light and sturdy, perfect for our purposes. Gather all that you can, please. Any flying creature shall suffice. 
Defend Ardenweald by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Ardenweald dungeons.	Support the Court	Groves are under attack everywhere! There simply aren't enough of us to protect them all! You just might be our only hope. We must restore order, or more precious souls will be lost to us. Please, help anyone you can, anywhere you can. My heart cannot bear to see any more pain! I'll make sure the Winter Queen hears of your deeds, don't you worry! 
Rescue 3 record keepers around the Vault of Secrets.	Keepers of Korthia	We've barely held out against the Jailer's forces. Now that you're here, we can finally make some progress. I know your priority is to enter the vault, but our record keepers must also be recovered. They are the authorities about everything kept in the vault. We can't let the Jailer learn what they know. 
Listen to Thiernax's plan.	Containing the Night	It is fortunate you are here, George. Thiernax believes he may know how to save Tyrande from the fate he himself suffered as the Night Warrior. Let us hear what he has to say. 
Head to the House of the Chosen with Draka.	The House of the Chosen	<Draka gestures to the sky.>Look there, mortal. That is the necropolis of Margrave Krexus, who leads the House of the Chosen. It is my honor to serve as his baroness. Let us ride to our fortress. There we can gather our strength and make ready for the battle to come. 
Use the Soul Mirror at the Eonian Archives to view Uther's arrival in Bastion.	Soul Led Astray	Uther was a being of justice on your world. I am sure it was quite surprising for you to see his fate here, following a leader who embodies what he stood against in life. I believe you should witness this memory firsthand. Take it to my soul mirror. View the memories within. 
Defeat Kalisthene in the Path of Ascension.	Overcoming the Trial	These new footpads can give Pelagos the edge he may need to defeat Kalisthene. Return to the Path, George. Equip Pelagos with these footpads and overcome your opponent. It may take a few tries, but all trials do. Go in service, and in glory! 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Deathrunner	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Inspire 11 Vulnerable Aspirants to action.	On the Edge of a Revelation	Ah! Good. You answered the call. As you can see, there are many aspirants who require our aid. Myself and the other disciples are hard pressed to deal with all of them. Some are in greater need than others. Aspirants are most at risk when they are on the precipice of a revelation. It is a critical moment that we cannot allow to pass without intervention. You must push them, one way or another. Find the most vulnerable among your peers and do what you can to help them find the path forward. 
	Feed the Annelids	 
Collect 13 Glittering Starflies.	Catch A Star	I require your aid on a... delicate matter, George. Starfly Wings form a vital ingredient for some of our creations and our supply is exhausted. They are tiny things, very fragile, and I am ill able to handle them delicately. Could you obtain the Starflies for me? They must be caught alive in order for their wings to not spoil and we desperately need them. I'll ensure that you are compensated for your time, of course. 
Report back to Droman Tashmur in Tirna Vaal.	When a Gorm Eats a God	There is nothing more we can do here. I will get Master Sha'lor safely back to Tirna Vaal. When you get there, report to the droman what we found here. If the gorm have started to eat the dead wildseeds, and are absorbing the power of the spirits within, we are all in serious danger. 
Ride 5 Bloodskin Tauraluses back to Dundae.	Take the Bull by the Horns	I've carved out quite the reputation as a tauralus wrangler. Everyone needs a tauralus! You do some work for me, and people will know who you are as well. Take this bone splinter and poke a few juicy nibblers. Use them to lure a tauralus to you, then ride it back to me. 
Travel to Ardenweald and collect 13 Hatchready Gorm Eggs.	Baker's Dozen	Under this very tent, I've prepared delicacies that would make demigods cry tears of joy. I'm always in need of more baking supplies! The brokers usually sell me eggs from parts near and far, but maybe this time you could help me out instead. You familiar with gorm? Big insect-like creatures native to Ardenweald. Well, if you find me some eggs of theirs, I'll bake you up something nice in return! Mama will even send Starchy to help you out. 
Collect 8 Shardhide Talons, 6 Gromit Feet, and 1 Razorwing Spines for Plague Deviser Marileth in Korthia.	Local Reagents	Korthia is an odd place. The wildlife here is different, likely due to years of exposure to the Vault and everything it contains. Are you ready to try some experiments? We'll need a good stock of reagents first. Near the Seeker's Quorum, you should be able to find shardhides, gromits, and razorwings. Watch out for their needles! 
Slay 3 Forsworn ascended.	An Inspired Moral Inventory	George! You are well! I am glad of it. Many of the ascended who once served this place have betrayed us. To turn so wholly against all that the kyrian stand for is... unimaginable.<The acolyte places a heavy spear in your hands.>This is a tool that has seen little use before today. Its sole purpose is to inspire a moment of reflection in those it touches. It will show them the error of their ways. If they remain unrepentant, then there is no hope for them. They must die. 
Return the souls rescued from the Maw to Tenaval in Sinfall within Revendreth.	Souls for Sinfall	Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives. Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one. In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued back to Sinfall. Denathrius's machinations have left the venthyr poorly provisioned, and Prince Renathal will require all the souls he can muster. 
Collect 10 azure pages, then bring them to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer	<You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover azure pages. Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing. If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.> 
Report to Polemarch Adrestes at Elysian Hold in Bastion.	Return to Adrestes	Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives. Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one. In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued to Elysian Hold. The kyrian are vital to the Shadowlands. If Bastion remains in turmoil, then all might soon be lost. 
Use the Helm of Domination to peer into Torghast.	The Captive King	King Anduin has not been found inside Torghast. I fear we could spend eternity searching those endless corridors to no avail. We must know what fate has befallen him. To peer into the tower represents a grave risk, yet we have little choice. Stand with me, George. We will use the broken Helm of Domination to see into that hellish place. Perhaps together we can hold back the hungry darkness. 
Complete 5 rounds of Solo Shuffle.	Solo Mission	Seems it is time you prove yourself alone. There's a chance for continual conflict, but this has to be undertaken by yourself. Sometimes you have to fight along side enemies to understand their tactics, this seems like a chance. Good luck. 
Take the construct requests from the souls present.	May I Take Your Order?	Chordy is just the first success, there will be many more! As free souls show up here, speak with them and take their requests for new construct bodies. We'll soon have lots of new constructs to work on! 
Activate the waystone and travel to Oribos.	Opening to Oribos	The prophecies told us that one day this dormant waystone would be needed by a Maw Walker. That it would prove crucial to the fate of the Shadowlands. It seems that day has come. Draw upon the anima within you to activate this waystone. It will then be usable by all those who aid your cause. If, as you say, Tal-Inara has created an anchor in Oribos, then that anchor will bring you back to us. Go, George. Inform your allies that the Maw awaits... and that Korthia needs their help. 
Gaiagantic and 12 Geomentals examined for research data.	Overgrown Story	Since our arrival here the Untamed Verdure has been a mystery waiting to be solved. The lush foliage of the area grows on everything as the creatures run amok without purpose. There could be valuable research data to be obtained from these creatures. Use a Containment Trap to subdue the elemental creatures. Once subdued, examine them for research data. 
	Annelid-ilation	 
Ring the gong to summon the special guest, then use mojo powder in the ritual to fuel Mueh'zala.	One Little Whisper	Here be da deal, George. To get Mueh'zala talkin', we gotta feed him a teeny bit a da life essence of everybody in dis room. Why ya be lookin' at me like dat? When has ol' Bwonsamdi ever let ya down? Me gonna use da mojo ya got to pull da truth outta him while he be feedin'. Oh, uh, just two more tings. First, I need ya to be ringin' an invitation to a special... friend. Den I be giving ya more of me mojo powder. Use it during da ritual if any o' me followers be gettin' too weak. 
Meet Xandria at Spider's Watch in Maldraxxus.	A Perilous Journey	Mograine has rallied the House of the Chosen to strike at Margrave Gharmal and his House of Constructs. They grow in strength with each passing day--this may be our only chance. We will join them on the field of battle. We will have justice for the fallen at my temple, as well as Mograine's own fallen kin. Rendezvous at Spider's Watch within Maldraxxus' northern reaches. We will move from there. 
Meet Marileth at the Seat of the Primus.	Fathomless Power	Forgive me, apprentice... I felt a bit woozy for a moment! But you've done it! You've crafted the potion! I'm so proud of you. What joy your work brought to our margrave! What manner of teacher would I be were I to ask for your help and not offer my own in return? If you have research you must conduct, you have my full support! Let us venture to your laboratory, then. I wait with bated breath to behold your future achievements! 
Empower the Rune of Might at the Seat of the Primus.	Front and Center	The runes on that blade... they are the same as the ones etched on the door to the Seat of the Primus. And one of them just began to glow...Is this what I think it is, $p? Do you have the means to unseal the Seat? If so, then perhaps Vyraz's gambit was not for nothing. This could turn the tide of the entire war! 
Subjugate 4 Fugitive Souls and deliver them to the Accuser.	The Proper Souls	We must save as many souls as we can from the fate we have just witnessed. Search the halls for souls who have escaped the Lord Chamberlain's perverse rituals. Subjugate them and bring them to me inside the Halls of Atonement. Together, we will make certain that each soul is appropriately processed and cared for. 
Speak with the forward scouts in Zereth Mortis.	Our Forward Scouts	The Jailer's forces control much of Zereth Mortis, but there are other dangers out there as well. I have dispatched scouts to survey the surrounding area and pinpoint any potential threats. Speak with each scout. They should have a report of their surveys. Gather this information and then return to me. 
Collect 6 River Sediment.	Spirit-Gathering Labor	You are not like the others. The waters here carry deep power. Power most have forgotten. But the tirnenn forget very little. Power flows through the earth just as water flows with power. Flows can be trapped for a time, dripping. Drop by drop they drip into vessels. Search for the vessels beneath the falls. Collect the power. 
Kill Forsworn constructs and collect and smelt 5 Tainted Centurion Components.	The Right Stuff	Building something that can help in your mission will require some metal. The constructs of the Forsworn have metal parts, suitable for what we need. Tainted by the Forsworn, they will need some additional work. Collect their metal and smelt them in the flames of the Eternal Forge to purge the corruption. 
Board Bootus and quell the devourer incursion.	Running a Muck	Bootus ready to smash devourer skulls. Hop on. 
	Gormling Piper: Crumbled Ridge	 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Viperid Menace	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Genesis Crawler	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Bring the Shadow Slicing Shortsword to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Shadow Slicing Shortsword	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shortsword in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Build one new construct.	Build One More	All these souls deserve a new construct, and when rebuilt any of them will make a valuable addition to our forces. We must start somewhere. You should be able to find Malleable Flesh through out the Shadowlands. A few of the other parts may be harder to locate. Collect parts and use the Abominable Stitching Table to build another construct. 
	Summon Your Sins	 
Bring the Gorak Claw Fetish to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Gorak Claw Fetish	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this fetish in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Shattered Grove secured and Khogov the Expunger captured.	Working for the Living	I see you are wondering where we acquire all of the challengers we supply to this arena. We scour countless realms in search of opponents to provide the Maldraxxi with firsthand combat experience. Currently, I am in the process of procuring a new combatant--and with it, a lucrative betting opportunity. Would you make use of our portal and assist Zo'umlo in capturing Khogov the Expunger? You will be appropriately compensated, of course. 
Bring the Lang Family Wood-Carving to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Lang Family Wood-Carving	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this wood-carving in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Obtain the Unusual Automaton Parts from Tred'ova in the Mists of Tirna Scithe.	A Valuable Find: Tirna Scithe	The gorm are indiscriminate in what they consume, so long as it does not contain anima. A gorm queen that has lived for many generations may have any number of indestructible artifacts lodged within her belly. For this reason, sifting through a queen's carcass is not unlike treasure hunting for us. One of the largest queens is currently consuming Tirna Scithe. She surely is bloated with valuables. Should you come upon anything particularly unusual, know that we will compensate you in kind. 
Collect an Umbral Plume from Darkwing in Greatwing Roost for Eumelia.	WANTED: Darkwing	The Cloudfeather matriarch, Darkwing, has fallen to a great and terrible sickness. She has grown aggressive, dominating her children and driving them to violence. Darkwing must be slain if her flock is to ever return to the Archon's grace. Please use the attached whistle to call her to her nest. I shall consider one of her crown feathers sufficient proof of the deed.--Eumelia, Stable Master 
Add the Conduits to the Forge of Bonds, then apply one to a slot on Niya.	A Conduit for Growth	While our bond is powerful in and of itself, you can also enhance it through the use of conduits. Conduits channel the anima between soulbinds in many different ways, increasing both of our potential in the process. They allow us to attune ourselves to each other's unique strengths. Let's use a few now. If they can further empower our bond, then they can aid us in protecting the forest. 
Help Glimmercane extract water from the pool in the Untamed Verdure.	A Splash of the Eternal	I don't really know much about this place or its inhabitants, but what I do know is magic! I can sense ancient power from the waters near us. Maybe that can help? Let's check out that pond! 
Take a Flayedwing Transporter to the Vault of Secrets	To the Vault	Thanks to the Bonesmith's repairs of both conduits, anima should now be flowing to the vault. That gives us a chance to get inside--assuming we can reach it. Our Maldraxxi allies have wrangled transportation to get us to and from the vault. I suggest we make haste. If the Jailer's minions obtain the sigil of the Primus before we do, it won't just be Korthia that suffers. All the Shadowlands may be forfeit. Let's go, Maw Walker. Our forces will be awaiting us. 
Bear witness to the empowerment of the chosen val'kyr and the binding of the Ilskahorn	Wrath of Odyn	The horn has been forged and the worthy have been selected. Now, George, we have only to bind my chosen val'kyr to the horn and infuse them with my power that they may strike with my fury. Come, bear witness. 
Slay the Satiated Sawtooth.	Stabbing Wasteward	I've been finding a lot of tauralus corpses lately, and I know it's all because those bonetooths Caleesy loves so much! I spotted the one that's responsible for the slaughter just west of here. Get rid of it! And don't mention this to Caleesy! 
Collect 44 Looted Animacones from spriggan within Ardenweald.	Return Those Animacones!	Reports say that once again the spriggan are proving to be a nuisance, George. Word is that a bunch of them broke into the stores at the Heart of the Forest and made off with a huge store of animacones. Needless to say, we need those animacones back. The report says the spriggan group split up as they were making their escape, so any one you see is as likely to be carrying the animacones as the next. Good luck. 
Collect Atonement Crypt Keys from venthyr around the Halls of Atonement and open Atonement Crypts until you find the Lost Cryptkeeper's Ring.	RSVP: Cryptkeeper Kassir	I would be most honored to attend Prince Renathal's Ember Court. I prefer to wear my official signet ring for such prestigious occasions. It was given to me by the Accuser herself when I was first charged with my duties. However, the Lord Chamberlain's goons have stolen it once more. They hide their ill-gotten gains inside of these crypts... But I have no idea which one houses my ring. It may take some time to find Atonement Crypt Keys, but any venthyr here in the halls could have one. 
Finalize your guest and amenity selections for the Ember Court, then do your best to impress your guest.	The Ember Court	We've got everything we need to host our first real Ember Court whenever you're ready, Maw Walker. Take a moment to finalize everything, and then we'll open court! Remember, we're trying to impress Cryptkeeper Kassir and convince him that we know what we're doing, so make sure you choose the refreshments and entertainment we hired for him! Once everything's ready, let me know and I'll open the court! 
Meet Scholar Roh-Suir at Keeper's Respite.	Establishing the Archive	I will head to Keeper's Respite, where there is some small semblance of safety. There, we will establish a new archive. Meet me there when you are able. I hope we can count on you again. We will have need of your assistance there in the future. 
Bring Pocopoc to Saezurah.	Oracle, Heal Thyself	The vessel, snatched from peril. This automa, a steadfast servant. Its energy, the key to my restoration. Pocopoc, it calls itself. A name that shall return to it. My name will be mine again. Saezurah, among the last of the oracles. Guide to those who would save Zereth Mortis. Bring Pocopoc. Its time as proxy has ended. The time of my awakening has arrived. 
Attune the filled heart of the tree at the shrines in the Dreamshrine Basin.	The Restless Dreamer	Now that we have the anima we need, we must attune the heart of Tirna Noch to the shrines of Hibernal Hollow. Then we can bring the wildseed's nightmares into the light and dispel them. Take the heart to the shrines just outside of Hibernal Hollow, in the Dreamshrine basin. Then bring the heart back to the wildseed to complete the preparations for the ritual. But be careful. Minions of the Drust seem to be amassing near the grove. 
Meet Polemarch Adrestes at the Seat of Eternal Hymns in Bastion.	Among the Kyrian	You will be well at home among the kyrian, <brother/sister>. We welcome your aid. The Archon was so confident in this outcome that she has arranged a grand reception for you in honor of your efforts against the Maldraxxus incursion into our realm. For now, all you must do is journey to the Seat of Eternal Hymns. I shall meet you there. 
Capture Alderyn and Myn'ir's memories.	The Hunt's Gratitude	The forests of Ardenweald are safer with your help, envoy of the kyrian. As a reward for your aid, we shall allow you to capture our memory. It is an honor to be chosen to help train the mighty warriors of Bastion. Whenever you are ready. 
Slay Wurtzog Soultap and recover 12 anima traces.	Hands on Approach	When I was imprisoned in the Etheric Vault, the anima scroungers would come to steal what little strength my soul still had. I swore I'd have revenge upon them should I ever escape. Now, with my blade hands... it's time for my revenge! I've seen anima scroungers near the House of Constructs. I want their leader dead and the anima they took from me recovered! 
Meet Lady Moonberry at the Refugee Camp beside the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.	The Heart of the Forest	I knew we were gonna get along! Welcome to our covenant. Well, almost. There's just a few details left. Little things. You know. Oaths to be made, blood pacts to sort out, firstborns to be promised.<Moonberry snorts a laugh.>I'm just kidding! Well, not about the oaths part. We take those seriously around here. I'll meet you at the camp outside the Heart of the Forest! 
Learn more about the kyrian.	A Fate Most Noble	Welcome, Worthy One! I am Greeter Mnemis. It is my duty and pleasure to assist you on this, your first day among the kyrian. Allow me to congratulate you. Your fate is reserved for the most noble of souls. Only those who lived a life of service may call Bastion home. I am certain you have many questions- all new aspirants do! Please allow me the honor of introducing you to the next chapter of your existence. We will begin when you are ready. 
Open an Atonement Crypt.	Atonement Crypt Key	<This key is marked with a sigil that matches the crypts in the Halls of Atonement. What is the Lord Chamberlain hiding away in there?> 
Speak with the Primus in Korthia.	Dreadlords!	This is the fifth dreadlord I have found infiltrating our forces this week. Unchecked they can cause tremendous damage to our foothold here. In life I learned how to identify these creatures from a demon hunter. It makes it far easier for me to locate them, but I cannot be in all places at once. We must report these findings to the Primus. 
Collect anima from around The Shrouded Asylum.	We Need More Power	Laurent's plan is a bit ambitious. Mirrors are most reliable when used to traverse short distances. Traveling to the sanctuary will require a great deal of power, more than he or I have. The shrouded have stores of anima in their compound. With enough of it, the mirror should be stable enough to get us where we need to go. 
Reenact the Third Invasion of the Legion on Azeroth.	Break a Leg	The show is about to begin! You... that's what you're going to wear? Well, I suppose it works. For your grand introduction, we will re-enact recent victories and events that took place on Azzinoth. Er, Azeroth. That's where you're from, right? The Starlight Company has graciously volunteered to assist us in this production. We've recruited some special guests as well! Don't worry about the script. This is your story, after all! Just try not to get too much blood on stage. It's hard to clean. 
Open the door to the Seat of the Primus.	The Door to the Unknown	You empowered the final rune? Then we might yet turn the tide of battle! Open the door, George! We'll hold the enemy back as long as we can! 
Return to the Seat of the Primus with your runeblade.	Her Rightful Place	Mor'Bitan has met his end... and a painful one at that. Your fortitude contributed in no small part to my success. You have earned my allegiance... for the time being. There is much left to do, should you truly desire ownership of this realm. Let us regroup at the Seat. 
Speak to Artemede to challenge the Path of Ascension.	Into the Coliseum	The time of your challenge has come! As you are not a being of Bastion, you shall act as a tactician for your soulbinds. You have developed mighty bonds between each other... let us see how they handle the coliseum. Let me know when you are ready to begin. Show us the merit of your bonds! 
Help the Accuser identify the sins of Kael'thas Sunstrider.	The Many Sins of Kael'thas Sunstrider	Kael'thas Sunstrider was on the verge of destruction when we rescued him from Castle Nathria. Denathrius had infused Kael'thas with unimaginable amounts of anima, each bit carrying with it the sins of others. It made his soul strong, but unstable--confused and pushed to the edge of its own existence. Trust me when I tell you that Kael'thas Sunstrider has enough sins of his own. Assist me in identifying which of the many sins heaped on his soul are truly his burden to bear. 
	Engineering: Bug Zapifier	 
Use the N'lyeth, Sliver of N'zoth to change your faction from Alliance to become devoted to N'Zoth. Then slay 10 Alliance players without dying.	Servant of N'Zoth	Mechanic...I have watched you... I have felt your bloodlust. But you serve false prophets... the Alliance is an illusion... I am a god! Prove to me you are worthy of my gift... kill those who are to betray you...Kill... the Alliance! 
Deliver this part to Rathan in Butchers Block.	Construct Part: Necromantic Oil	<This could be used to construct a powerful abomination. Perhaps Rathan will know how we can use it.> 
Speak with General Draven.	How to Wear Seven Medallions	One venthyr cannot wear seven medallions and command the power they bestow, nor command respect from anyone looking at them. What I propose is the crafting of an artifact that can contain the power of the medallions. Focusing that power to one wielder. Unfortunately, Revendreth lacks the craftsmanship needed to channel such powers. Not without turning the wearer into a puppet of Denathrius. No, for this, we must employ the aid of a realm that specializes in service. Draven has the details. 
Bring the Travel Journal to Archivist Dreyden in the Grove of Memory.	A Travel Journal	<This book appears to be a travelogue of this book's personal journey around Ardenweald! And self-written and published no less! Flipping towards the end you see yourself enter the picture as a villain, unjustly attacking the book and opening it. You read ""This book appears to be a travelogue of this book's personal journey around Ardenweald! And Self-written and-""You hurriedly close the book, feeling queasy. It should go back to Archivist Dreyden.> 
Dredge a dredger and bring it to the pile of rubble. Wait for it to dig through the pile and collect the Gem of Binding.	Dredger Duty	You fixed up the muck pool so we can make some dredgers, but them devourers are gonna keep causin' trouble. We're gonna need a Gem of Binding so we can dredge up a biggun to protect the pool. I'll show you how to dredge up some disposable dredgers to work with for now. Get 'em digging in the rubble to find us a Gem of Binding, and then we'll reshape 'em all into a biggun to kick them devourers outta here! 
Analyze 6 Warped Rifts.	Rift Recon	Devourers are a problem. Rifts are a bigger problem. They will keep bringing devourers. We must close them. To do this, we need information. Take the crescendal. Use it to analyze the rifts. Bring the information back to us. 
Destroy 10 Gorm Eggs in the Banks of Life.	Breaking a Few Eggs	As you can see, we have a gorm problem. I'm not sure what has them so riled up. They've been getting bigger, more hostile. It must be due to the anima drought. If nothing stops them, they'll eat everything! Their egg production is out of control. We can't let their population grow any larger. Please, go in to their nests and destroy as many of their eggs as you can find. 
Disarm the traps within the Third Chamber of Kalliope and make your way to the final hall.	You Go First	You've proven useful. So, I am going to require you to disarm the defenses of this hall. Please take care not to die too quickly. I'd like to have the spear before the end of this eon. 
Follow the Koh jiro in the Untamed Verdure.	Moment of Truth	Our constructor is ready. We shall start the process to open the Blooming Foundry and reset this land. We can start over. 
Find Firim.	Finding Firim	You found something? What luck! May I see the letter? So, an Enlightened named Xevveth heard that Firim was last seen west of the Forge of the Afterlives, and went to go seek him out. We should begin our search there. 
Kill 20 Insatiable Mites, 5 Soul-Parched Gorgers, and 2 Reality Breachers.	Reclaiming Provis Esper	Provis Esper is overrun with devourers, buzzing around like hungry vespoids. They are destroying the local automa, which is not at all what the First Ones intended. A cleansing is in order. For our safety and to restore the natural order, clear some of them out. 
Find Thiernax near the Queen's Garden.	The Speaker of Elune	Fortune smiles upon us, George. We have found a soul in Ardenweald who was once a Night Warrior in life, as Tyrande is now. His name is Thiernax. I am told he assists in tending to the spirits resting in the Garden of Night. Seek him out and petition him for aid. I pray he will have wisdom to share. 
Grapple 6 Battlesewn Rocs out of the sky.	Aerial Advantage	Gharmal's rocs dominate the skies above, striking at our forces as we advance. We cannot move the necropolis into position until they are cleared out! I would slaughter them myself, but the cowards remain out of reach, and I am not constructed for flight. You, however, seem slight enough of build. Take my riding hook and latch onto a roc. Once you are atop of one, beat it to a pulp. Worry about the landing later. 
Free 5 Captured Forgehands.	Stewards of a Feather	You! Maw Walker! The forge was bustling. Many forgehands, on task! Then Forsworn came. Some followed their demands, turned to their side. But not all! Yes, rescue forgehands so they can aid us. Work to be done! 
Escort Lord Chamberlain to Darkhaven.	To Darkhaven	Across this bridge is the hamlet of Darkhaven. It is fortified by those loyal to Sire Denathrius. These pitiful rebels would not dare approach it. However, getting to it may prove challenging. Here, I shall carry the anima, you make sure no one throws us back into the Endmire. 
Burn Enlightened Incense around the Great Veldt.	Favor of the First Ones	The attack from the Jailer's forces is a sign! In the past, there was one among us who sought the forbidden knowledge of the First Ones. For that, we must have earned their ire and lost the protections we once had. We must atone for the trespasses of our kin. Take this incense. Go out into the veldt and burn it as offerings to the First Ones. I hope they will offer us forgiveness. 
Seek out Thanikos at Xandria's Vigil.	Imminent Danger	The Temple of Courage must not fall! All kyrian learn to fight in its hallowed halls. Not only to protect Bastion, but to ensure their own safety when retrieving souls from across the veil. Travel there at once. Seek out Thanikos, the Paragon of Courage's loyal hand. 
Collect 1 Mawsworn Ritual Book, 10 Mawsworn Missive Scraps, and 15 Dark Marrow.	Looming Darkness	The Winter Queen called for a hunt in this location due to reports of a massive, unnatural darkness swelling in its upper regions. The Wild Hunt is brave, but not foolish. We must learn what we can about this darkness before we charge into it. Search the bodies of our enemies nearby for clues. 
Use the Sensory Synchronizer, then reset 10 Triggered Traps near Exile's Hollow.	Security Measures	It seems the hidden traps I placed around the grotto are not as effective as I would like, considering your presence in my home. However, they are still useful in preventing the majority of unwanted attention. Since you so kindly brought assassins to me, I cannot reset the traps myself. So you will need to do it for me. I will stay here to guard both myself and my precious research. Use this Sensory Synchronizer I placed nearby to show you which traps need to be reset. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Shelly	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Activate the Transportation Network.	A Mycelial Network	Anima flows into the deepest of roots, feeding the mushrooms. Long has it been since we used the rings to travel across Ardenweald. Restore our connection to the mushroom network. 
Collect 12 Replicating Essence.	Unchecked Growth	This growth energy is highly unusual. I would like to know more about how it affects the local automa. Harvest replicating essence from deceased automa in the Catalyst Gardens. Bring it back to me for study. 
Reduce the devourer presence at the Terrace of Formation.	A Jiro Guide to Not Being Eaten	Devourers attacked. They overran the guardians. They still search for food. We are not safe. Reduce the devourers' numbers. This is how not to be eaten. 
Perform the counter curse.	Mending a Broken Hart	We have all the reagents for the counter-curse! Hurry up and cast it before Qadarin's soul is lost, and Thiernax refuses to help you, and Tyrande is doomed to die horribly in the Maw, and everyone is sad! But no pressure. 
Rescue 5 missing pilgrims.	Pluck from the Vines	I ran, scrambling through the thorny foliage, the lashers snapping at my heels. My fellow pilgrims were not so lucky. I could hear their screams of pain and horror as I fled. You must find a way inside. Rescue them, George! 
	Echthra, Dame of Hatred	 
Bring the Mysterious Soul Mirror to Thenios at the temple in the Eonian Archives.	Mysterious Soul Mirror	<A shimmering soul mirror draws your attention on Devos's corpse. Peculiar that she would keep one on her person. Perhaps Thenios will want to see this.> 
Return the lost loa and Vol'jin to the Winter Queen in Ardenweald.	Parting Ways	Me don't know what fate be comin' for ol' Vol'jin... but it be waitin' for me in Ardenweald. Ashamane, Hir'eek, Shadra... dey belong dere, too. We best be gettin' outta here. Me had enough of da Maw for an eternity. 
Find and kill 4 Dreadlord Saboteurs.	Nothing is True	If we are dealing with dreadlords, they could be disguised as anything... including the denizens of Zereth Mortis. Fortunately we have just the thing for dispelling their illusions. Search the fields and test the automa. If you find any dreadlords, take care of them. 
Meet Lord Herne outside of Darkreach.	We Strike Now	The time has come. The Wild Hunt has driven the Drust back to their stronghold at the edge of Ardenweald. Their scouts report that Gorak Zhar herself is among them. This may be our only opportunity to fully purge the minions of Thros from this realm. Lord Herne awaits your arrival at the battlefront. Go with haste, George. 
Activate the Abomination Factory.	Abominable Stitching and Me	Constructs have formed the backbone of Maldraxxi armies in more wars than anyone can count. A well-constructed body can turn any soul into a potent frontline weapon. There is an old abominable stitching table outside of the sanctum that could be used to build our own constructs. With the anima you've secured for our covenant, we should be able to restore it. Report to Miggsie once the work has begun. You can find her at Butchers Block. 
Complete the hunting ritual at Wanecrypt Hill.	Let the Hunt Begin	One step remains until we may begin the Penitent Hunt. You and the other hunters will first siphon a small amount of anima from the souls. It will come with ease. The soul's time in the Grove of Terror causes trace anima to release. This anima helps us venthyr in tracking the prey's fear. I also ask that you do us the honor of signaling the hunt.<The Fearstalker hands you an anima stake and a hollowed dredbat fang.>Use these to complete the task. 
Deliver Gravewing Crystal to the Stonewright in Keeper's Respite.	Gravewing Crystal	<This large crystal fragment shattered off of the massive construct's body. Flashes of energy crackle inside of it. The Stonewright in Keeper's Respite would be able to use this crystal to empower a gravewing for you.> 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Pale Regal Cervid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.><The Enlightened of Pilgrim's Grace likely know where such a forge can be found.> 
Bring the memory back to Appraiser Au'vesk in Oribos.	The Vessels of Jewels	You have the bearing of a lapidary. Though familiar with the art of jewelcraft, perhaps there is yet more to learn. Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you. Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way. What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact. 
Infiltrate the Eternal Terrace and deliver Prince Renathal's message to the Countess.	Harvester of Desire	So, here's the sketch: we muck you up to look like one of the servants. This stuff is protected by anti-theft so if 'em clothes think they are being stolen they teleport back here, you an' all. You ""should"" be able to reach the Countess with your message. Just smile, nod, do as you're told, don't talk to anyone, and don't make eye contact with anything that's got wings. They'll know you shouldn't be there. 
Recover the Codex of Memories for Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Beginning the Collection	Let us continue our work by retrieving the most important item of any scholarly study--the lost codex. It will take some time, but as we continue our work the pages of this work will continue to grow and flourish, just as Korthia has itself for eons. As for its location, it previously resided deep within the underbelly of Korthia itself inside the Cavern of Contemplation to the south. We can only hope the Jailer's forces have yet to locate it. 
Test the transportation device from Ve'nari's bag.	Grab Bag	Interesting. Aural sequencers and an ethereal cloak. You hang on to those, George. I have a suspicion they will prove useful. Ah, and something special for me as well. If I'm not mistaken--and I so rarely am--this is a projection mechanism. Very handy! And what's this? A transportation device of some kind. We should test it immediately. By ""we,"" of course I mean you. 
Set the ground rules about working together with Ve'nari.	Setting the Ground Rules	Back to rescue more souls? How intrepid. Though I must say, your earlier escapade has drawn the Jailer's attention... and his ire. After all, none have successfully eluded him before. Except for me. Now his forces are on high alert, hunting down any errant souls that the fabled Maw Walker may try to steal from him. It has made things quite... inconvenient for me. If you and I are going to work together, we need to set a few ground rules. And you must be properly equipped. 
Speak with Lord Garridan to see your Guest List, then meet Cryptkeeper Kassir to earn his RSVP.	Ember Court: Guest RSVPs	Prince Renathal will wish to invite certain guests to each Ember Court. In the future, we'll be able to adjust the guest list to make it easier to please everyone in attendance. But, we should follow the Prince's lead on this first one. Work with Lord Garridan and Lady Ilinca to ensure that Cryptkeeper Kassir is able to attend and returns his RSVP. If you haven't met Cryptkeeper Kassir yet in your adventures, you may need to introduce yourself before he'll listen to you. 
Inform Mikanikos he is now able to participate in the Path of Ascension.	Ascension Calling: Mikanikos	<While this scroll mimics Kleia's invitation to the Path of Ascension, it is very clearly written in Sika's hand. It details an invitation for Mikanikos to participate in the Path, along with Bron. Perhaps you should bring this to Mikanikos.> 
Enter the Maw.	Seeking the Baron	Take this amulet. One like it is carried by each of the Four Horsemen. The amulets are imbued with a power that links them to one another. That connection should help you locate Darion Mograine. No doubt Darion has witnessed countless horrors in the Maw. Perhaps he has caught sight of the missing baron. Let us hope he can lead you to our Azerothian allies as well. 
Collect Pristine Water from Ardenweald's Distant Grotto.	Ember Court: Tubbins's Tea Party	Theotar need tea for party? Tubbins make best! Special tea. Very special. Only I can make. Recipe need very good water from garden place. Good pool on special floaty island! You go get and Tubbins makes tea! 
Track down Huln Highmountain.	Out On the Edge	It sounds like Huln was taken elsewhere, and by the Stonewright herself! We should look for signs she came through the area. Hopefully that will lead us to Huln! 
Collect 3 Anima-charged Maldracite.	Prey Upon Them	My mission cannot progress without a supply of anima. Fortunately, the necromancers nearby have been kind enough to gather some into their maldracite crystals. You will relieve them of those crystals. They may be reluctant to part with them, but I trust you can be... persuasive. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Revendreth.	Aiding Revendreth	Take flight to Revendreth, where those that are loyal to the Shadowlands are under siege from the forces of Sire Denathrius. We cannot allow them to fall. Without the aid of Sinfall, the forces of Revendreth will grow unchecked, and their dark alliance with the Jailer will threaten us all. We of Bastion will not allow this to happen! Raise your swords, ready your shields, take wing and bring the glory of Bastion to Revendreth! 
Teleport to the Overlook to meet with Draka.	The Golden Dawn	The machinations of war commence. Gharmal's crimes are now evident to all of the Shadowlands. Bastion demands vengeance, and we shall share it with them. Only our combined forces will defeat the Constructs once and for all. Meet Draka at the overlook. Your presence there will help solidify an agreement. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Maldraxxus.	Aiding Maldraxxus	In the fetid wastes of Maldraxxus, we yet find allies. Their sacred duty, to defend the Shadowlands, has not been forgotten by all. We must take flight, now, to stand side by side with our bone-bound brethren. Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, we will push back those that would sow chaos and discord. A spear of gold and bone we will form! And thrust it into the heart of evil! Go now, Maw Walker, as the tip of the spear, to glorious battle! 
Bring the Penguin Soul to Choofa in the Heart of the Forest.	Penguin Soul	<The Penguin Soul is playful and sociable. The shape of the penguin will be yours to call upon.> 
Bring the memory back to Tanner Au'qil in Oribos.	The Vessels of Leather and Bone	You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of leatherworking. But perhaps you have more to learn. Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you. Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way. What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact. 
Commune with Lady Moonberry.	Show, Don't Tell	As a new champion of the Court, you'll need to be properly introduced to the rest of the Night Fae. And that calls for something big. Bold. Memorable. A demonstration of who you are and where you've come from. Something with... flair. Normally, we spend ages crafting a masterpiece presentation. But we don't have time for that! We'll just have to improvise.<Moonberry winks.>Commune with me so I can pick up the highlights! I'll make sure it's a show to remember! 
Speak with Prince Renathal.	Medallion of Avarice	The Medallion of Avarice was the tool of the Curator. With its power it granted her authority over the Catacombs Ward. Combined with her knowledge of the vast library of sinstones Revendreth has accumulated over the ages, the Curator was a master of her craft. When Denathrius defeated my first rebellion, he tossed both myself and the Curator into the Maw. The Curator was clever, though, and she hid the medallion before Denathrius could act. Come, let us speak of plans. 
Complete the ritual at the Frozen Throne to open the rift into the Maw.	Through the Shattered Sky	When Sylvanas shattered the Helm of Domination, she was touched by the power it released. I can sense the echoes of that power, and I know where she has gone. If you wish to rescue your leaders, the shattered helm can open a path. It cannot bring you back, however. That you must do on your own. The risk is great, George, but there is no other way. We will begin the ritual at once. 
Speak with Louison.	I Could Be A Contender	Hold up there, <brother/sister>. If you are serious about fighting in the Arena you're going to need a manager. Lucky for you, <brother/sister>, I know a guy. He's just had some openings in his roster of fighters and you look like just the type of Mechanic he needs to fill his ranks. Name is Louison, you can find him at the gate just east of here. Tell him I sent ya, <brother/sister>. 
Perform the final acts!	What's My Motivation?	Now for our finale! A thrilling performance of the most recent trials on Azathoth!<Featherlight checks his notes.>Azeroth. Whatever. It features an artificial god, a powerful magic ice princess, an infamous queen, and an eldritch abomination of unspeakable terror! Who doesn't love a good drama with a dash of existential horror? You're back to playing yourself, so just... do whatever heroes are supposed to do! 
Ride the fae rings and slay 30 Possessed Desecrators in Heartwood Grove.	Hyphae Patrol: Heartwood Grove	Those masked fiends have taken over Heartwood Grove, and I mean to stop their plans. Heartwood Grove was so beautiful before. And now, it's... No matter. We're going to fix this, you and me. Right now. Come, join me in battle. We'll give those monsters a thrashing that will make their masters think twice before desecrating that sacred place again! 
Stand before a Soul Mirror and witness memories from Lysonia's past.	Lysonia's Truth	If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I do not know that I would believe such a thing is possible. You carry a significant piece of Lysonia within you, now. Go to the Soul Mirrors and open yourself to them. With luck, they will draw from her essence to draw forth a memory of the Forsworn. If this works, we may know what they are planning within minutes! 
Slay the Gorm Matriarch.	Queen of the Underground	You tracked the massive gorm here to her den, and we've found Master Sha'lor. Perhaps not entirely unscathed, but he lives. That is enough. One last task remains. Let us end this. 
Set the Stage then help the reenactment of events after the Legion's fall.	The Fourth Wall, er, War	It's time for the next act of your theatrical introduction: the Grand Drama Of Azereth! Azeroth. Right. All these worlds are hard to tell apart. Help set the stage, then come back here. You'll need to play a few other characters before you appear as yourself again. Get a move on! We have a lot to cover! 
Speak with Bonesmith Heirmir about your runeblade.	Forging a Champion	Of all the souls who have reached that stone, only you discovered its true purpose. I am no zealot, but clearly there is a deeper meaning in this. We would be wise to investigate further. Find Bonesmith Heirmir at her forge. She is the most renowned smith in Maldraxxus, and the last remaining apprentice of the Primus himself. She will know what course to take. 
Bring Nadjia a fancy beverage.	A Fine Vintage	We will need something special to use as the base of our mixture. To get him to drink it down he will have to believe you've brought him a gift. He fancies himself quite the connoisseur. Some ancient and stuffy vintage will tempt him. Check the old cellar near the ruins. It once held supplies. Perhaps a bottle still lingers in the depths. Araak and I will work out the other details. 
	Destroy the Dominant	 
Meet with Margrave Sin'Dane in the Exoramas in the House of Rituals.	Akarek Avenged	The last of those traitors involved in taking down Margrave Akarek are dead. It will not bring our Margrave back, but I am still pleased. My Baroness wished for us to inform Margrave Sin'dane that the job was done before departing for Ardenweald. 
Assist with the ritual.	The Power of Elune	We have done as much as we can with the time we had. Now we must lend our power to Thiernax and the others, and hope Tyrande survives. 
Place a Signaling Beacon in Cocyrus.	Rule 3: Trust is Earned	Before you leave this cursed realm, there is one final task you must complete for me. The Mawsworn regularly transfer souls to various blocks of Torghast from many different areas in the Maw. I happen to know of one such area. Place this beacon there so I may be informed when the next transfer happens. And if you are seen by the enemy... well, you are known for your prowess in combat, yes? 
Collect 6 Intact Spore Clusters from Escaped Blightrays in the Reagentry.	Cage Free Spores	I will need your assistance with the collection of one other reagent for your master. These spore clusters he requests--while normally a trivial matter--will require a bit of work. You see, as the veilwing rampaged throughout the Reagentry, it toppled and broke several nearby cages hosting the blightrays from which we harvest the clusters. You will have to collect them through more... conventional means. The clusters are fragile, however, so try not to damage them while subduing the creatures. 
	Enemy of My Mnemis	 
Kill the Cultivator.	Nip It in the Bud	The Catalyst Wards used to be peaceful. Pilgrims have been coming here for ages to observe the wonders of the First Ones. But this place is no longer safe. The Cultivator showed no mercy and no reason as it slew several of our brethren. You must destroy it. Other Elders would disagree with me. The other Elders are wrong. 
Complete the Crest of Ascension.	Building the Base	The Crest is almost complete. I give you the honor of the final touch. You have done much. Please, take Phaestus and give the final blow! 
Take specifications for Neena's construct.	Every Dog Has Its Day	Maw Walker, when I heard you were building constructs and a home for souls still loyal to Maldraxxus, I began my search for you! I am loyal and have always wanted a construct form, but the Margrave was unwilling to build one that suited my natural inclinations. I lived my whole life with the curse, it's all I know, and it's all I still want. Would you build a construct for me? 
Recover the three segments of the Lodestaff.	The Sundered Staff	I have no choice but to trust you with the secrets of the Lodestaff. In the right hands, such as those of a trained Archivist, the staff can locate influential relics from the afterlives of the Shadowlands. It was split into three segments to ensure that it would not fall into the wrong hands. The invaders have found the pieces, but they are yet not aware of their significance. Recover the pieces of the staff. Each segment is held by a different member of the Mawsworn. 
Place the Box of Many Things in Torghast.	Tower Knowledge	The woven power of this box can only be unlocked by feeding it pride and memory. In its weave are incantations I have seen used in the other realms to siphon or condition a soul. This... abomination... has used these tools of redemption and honor to create a lock. As you challenge the floors of Torghast, your skill, speed, and efficiency will all contribute to Tower Knowledge which this box can feed upon. Feed it to retrieve the powers within. 
Revive the Hidden Servitor in the Arrangement Index.	Revival of the Fittest	This core is brimming with energy! Use the charged core to revive the automa. Hopefully, it will no longer see us as a threat. Do be careful. The power of the First Ones is not meant for us to control. 
Meet Elder Ara above Provis Esper.	Forging Unity from Diversity	The other Elders follow a strict interpretation of how best to honor the works of the First Ones. I am not so inflexible. Our end goal is the same. Let us return to the area where you last saw the Jailer. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Prototype Leaper	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Rescue Casad, Wagonmaster Derawyn, and Te'zan from the possessed.	Survivors of Heartwood Grove	Korenth... I can't believe he's...We have to save whomever we can. Droman Krelnor is too strong for us to face alone. I saw a few other survivors scattered around the grove. Hurry, we have no time to waste! 
Deliver the potion to Scrapper Minoire.	Side Effects	Scrapper Minoire's use of enhancers creates unpredictable betting implications. It is quite unhealthy... for our profits! For a nominal fee, Au'larrynar can provide you with a ""special"" enhancer that Minoire will not be able to resist: a potion that turns the one who imbibes it into the ultimate combatant... and teaches them a lesson in restraint, as well. I cannot wait to see Minoire's next match in the arena! 
Kill assassins near Exile's Hollow.	Unseen Agents	Ever since you opened the way from Oribos, certain cartels have taken the opportunity to come after me and my work in a rather... lethal fashion. They know how important my research is to everything. More assassins are sure to follow, what with you blazing a clear path right to me! I cannot get them all. You need to fix this and help protect my secrets. Take care of them for me. 
Deliver the remains of Ara'lon's spear to Lord Herne at Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.	The Broken Spear	<The shattered remains of a sylvari spear litter the ground. You recognize the spear as belonging to Ara'lon. This confirms that Ara'lon was here. Unfortunately, he is nowhere to be found. Lord Herne will want to know of your discovery.> 
Use the Chains of Regret on Escaped Captives and bring them to any intact Catacombs Cage.	Break Out	Our reinforcements never came, leaving us unable to tend to the souls here. They have begun to break out of their cells. Many of them are not ready for the next step in the process. Take these iron chains. They can be used to rein them under your control. Once you have a soul bound, you can return them to any intact cage you can find. 
Question the Brokers trapped inside Torghast.	Information for a Price	We must continue our search for Jaina Proudmoore. I have a new strategy to suggest. Since arriving in Oribos, I have been approached by many of the brokers. Some ask questions, others offer help--for a price. You have encountered others of their kind inside Torghast. They may possess information we can use, though I doubt they will part with it freely. Seek them out and appeal to their avarice. Offer to pay for whatever information they possess. 
Meet Shandris near the Provis Strata.	Knowing is Half the Battle	George, you should join Shandris and infiltrate the Mawsworn forces from the east. Whatever information you two uncover will inform us of your next course of action. Take care. We have no information on what you may find. 
Meet Elder Ara outside the Catalyst Wards.	In the Weeds	I understand now why Elder Nirav is filled with worry. Many of the pilgrims who have journeyed to the Catalyst Wards have not returned. This includes Feroz, who is most likely to have information we need to restore the remnants. Prepare yourself. The First Ones's newest creations are prevalent at the Catalyst. If something has gone wrong there, it could be tragically dangerous. 
Bring the Crane Soul to Lady Muunn in the Heart of the Forest.	Crane Soul	<The Crane Soul dances with grace. The shape of the crane will be yours to call upon.> 
Place the Seal of Contrition in the Crest of Ascension.	The Seal of Contrition	Preparations for the Seal are complete. Go, insert it into the Crest. Be delicate, yet firm! Move with purpose, but a steady hand. 
Head to the Forge of Afterlives with Jaina.	Fighting for the Forge	We made our way here as soon as we could. Anduin has been sighted near the structure in the middle of this land, referred to as the Forge of Afterlives. No doubt the Jailer will join him soon. We need to leave immediately. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Omnipotential Core	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Find 5 Newcomer Corpses and slay Deadeye.	The Last Guy	You're not the first newcomer wanting to become famous. There've been a lot like you around! The last few wanted to prove themselves by killing a giant bloodtusk... none of them ever returned! You want to get recognition? Go find all those missing newcomers and kill the bloodtusk yourself. 
Direct Jiro Prime to rescue 7 Distressed Jiro, while slaying 5 Mawbroken Automa and 100 Mawsworn forces.	Super Jiro	The outsiders have disrupted the tasks and purpose of the jiro. We cannot allow this to continue. We will empower a larger jiro to help combat these threats. Jiro Prime will destroy the enemies that threaten Zereth Mortis. Help direct Jiro Prime to resolve our crisis. 
Collect 12 Intact Automa Fragments from Alerted Automa within Genesis Vestibule	For Research Purposes	I have taken pains not to disturb the automa during my time in Zereth Mortis, and so far they have paid little attention to me. It seems recent events have changed that. Again, let me be clear that I have no wish to harm the creations of the First Ones. But if, in the course of your efforts, conflict with the automa becomes inevitable, we must ensure that some good can come of it. If I can examine fragments of fallen automa, it may provide knowledge to use against the Mawsworn. Go carefully. 
Enter the Maw with Kleia, then meet her outside Perdition Hold.	The Power of the Maw	Lysonia flees to the Maw to enact her dark rituals. As the Maw Walker, you are the only one who can pursue her. Take Kleia and my blade. She must be stopped. 
Destroy the Maldraxxi encampment at Death's End.	A Farewell to Arms	The Maldraxxi toil away just behind us. I care not if you consider them allies or traitors, so long as you remove them from Revendreth. Destroy their encampment. Purge it from our soil, and ensure such an affront never occurs again. The means are not important. All that matters is that these heretics remember the consequences of trifling with true power. 
Slay Charthox in the Dredgewood of Revendreth.	Cut 'Em Down to Size	Idle hands are a wasted opportunity. I need to keep my hands busy, or else these blades wouldn't be worth anything! I hear there's a devourer in Revendreth that's as tall as a house. Let's show the other constructs a thing or two by taking that monster out! 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Multichicken	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Use the Scroll of Dark Empowerment to conjure a Mirror Network.	Sanctum Upgrade: Mirror Network	Right. So, we got a Scroll of Dark Empowerment ready for youz that should manifest 'em mirror frames for you. Pre'y standard work. Thing is, after you going to need a proper mirror maker to get 'em up an' workin'. Prince Renathal might know a fang with the right skills. Best speak with him. 
Throw Filthy Rubble into the muck pool.	It's a Dirty Job	This muck pool is all out of order. The anima shortage has taken its toll here for sure. You see, the pools require filth and fiber to grow dredgers effectively. The problem is every time I try to treat the pool, the dang devourers are on my back! Now the untreated muck is starting to coagulate into these elementals! Can you go and toss some of the filthy rubble into the pool to restore it? 
Reclaim anima to empower the Vengeful Soul and defeat Inquisitor Moorlac with their help. Suggested Players [3]	Feed Your Soul	They... drained my anima... to fuel their ritual...Souls of great power are brought here... to this altar... and sacrificed to conjure unspeakable horrors bound to the Jailer. I was powerful once... Imbue me with the anima they stole... and I can be powerful again. Then, together... we will destroy the one who leads their efforts. 
Activate the gateway to Maldraxxus.	A Land of Strife	It is imperative that you identify the cause of the attack on Bastion. We will require your aid to open the gateway. Once the focus is sufficiently powered, we will call upon the gate to Maldraxxus and direct it into position. From there, the fate of this war must rest upon your shoulders. 
Talk to Firim about the oracle.	Now You May Speak	You truly brought me an oracle! Intact even! I have never known these divine beings to speak to anyone but automa. There is so much we could learn from her about Zereth Mortis. You must tell me everything! 
Slay attackers, save caretakers, and hatch silkstrider larvae in the Gossamer Cliffs.	Tough as Silk	We are the heart of silk production in Ardenweald, but we can't do our work! Our grove has been completely taken over by spriggans and these strange shapeshifting... things. The silkstriders who spin the silk are very delicate creatures. They need peace and calm, and a little music to keep them happy! But with all these monsters all over the place, they're super stressed out. Please, can you get in there and eliminate these hooligans, and see if you can help get us up and running again? 
Help Plaguey test their infection ability in the Mauler's Outlook.	Oozing with Character	Apprentice! I've been looking for you. Kevin has been such a wonderful helper in our experiments, I'd like to train my other oozes to be able to assist as well! Can you take Plaguey with you and test their ability to infect organic life forms? 
Enter Haven and meet with the Enlightened.	Forging Connections	Firim described these Enlightened brokers unfavorably. Then again, he does seem a bit... eccentric. Regardless, if we are to restore contact with our comrades in Oribos and defeat the Jailer, we will need allies in Zereth Mortis. The Mawsworn look to be gathering outside the gates of Haven. We must not let any more innocents fall prey to the Jailer's villainy. Hopefully the Enlightened will welcome our aid. After you, my friend. 
Use the Vesper of Veilflight to travel to Oribos, then witness Ben Howell's judgment.	Where a Soul Belongs	This soul is no longer tethered to his world of Azeroth. Kleia must perform her duty and bear him to Oribos to be judged by the Arbiter. Take this vesper. When you are ready, it will call Ascended to ferry you back across the Veil to Oribos. Go in service. 
Speak with Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge in the Maw.	Mysterious Gifts from Ve'nari	I'm impressed by your sheer tenacity to survive while remaining somewhat useful, Maw Walker. You remind me of myself when I was much younger and naive. Take this and continue your work... somewhere less conspicuous. 
Kill Vyraz.	A Traitor's Due	Vyraz has been a constant thorn in Maldraxxus's side since he betrayed us. As Baroness of the House of the Chosen, it is my duty to see this threat eliminated... and the murder of Margrave Krexus avenged. As the Primus said, we must remove the head from this snake. The time to strike is now! 
Kill 15 creatures within the Untamed Verdure.	Clearing the Ruins	This place was abandoned for too long. The vegetation has overtaken the land. We must enter the Blooming Foundry to fix it. Until then: clear the area. Remove the deviants who have grown twisted over time. 
Eliminate Enemy forces and positions.	Planned Demise	Our defense is tenuous at best, but the enemy is still hesitant to attack. As long as they fear us, they won't be probing our defenses. You must keep the pressure on the enemy. Attack their positions all along our line. 
Collect 28 Perfect Ardenmoth Wing Scales from Ardenmoths.	Just Wing It	For untold ages, the humble Ardenmoth has supplied the scales for the creation of armor for the Wild Hunt. Now, with our attention divided between the threats to the realm and the anima drought, it has become increasingly difficult for our foragers to find the perfect scales that we require. Only the scales of the highest quality are suitable. If you should obtain any in your travels and return with them, I shall ensure you are well rewarded. 
Speak to Kleia in the Chamber of First Reflection.	The Chamber of First Reflection	Ah, Athanos. It remains undefeated, as intended. Still, you have exceeded any expectation I might have had. You are stronger than many that have come before you. You have come here for a purpose, and Kleia has illuminated a path that she believes you can walk. I agree. I have opened the way to the Crucible's final rite. Follow the path to the south and east. There you will find the entrance to the Chamber of First Reflection. Kleia will instruct you further. Go in service, George. 
Bring the Cipher of Understanding to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Cipher of Understanding	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for the cipher in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Make sure all of Choofa's friends are able to attend the party.	RSVP: Choofa	Oooh a party! I love parties. My friends have to come too or it's just not as much fun. Ask them please! You need to find Awool, Rury, and Slanknen so we can go together. 
Eliminate 6 Dominated Automa and 3 Darkseer Corrupters.	Unforgivable Intrusion	Darkness spreads dissonance throughout these halls. Mawsworn drain life from the air, and give only suffering in return. This must not be. If the song is to be restored, silence is needed. The Mawsworn must be destroyed. 
Defeat Malfestus, Domonous, and Furis.	United In Pride	Despite our competitive differences, Nemea and I work as a team when faced with greater threats. The pride and the phalynx are both fierce fighters upon the battlefield. We would both be honored to assist you in the battle that lies ahead. Please allow either Andira or Gatamatos to assist you in defeating the Jailer's champions that threaten our forces. 
Find and slay the Aggregate of Doom.	WANTED: Aggregate of Doom	Attention all workers: We got ourselves a problem down in the thicket. A golem is trekking through the worksite, causing all sorts of trouble. Grab a rock and get to throwin'. The dredger that takes it out gets the rest of the day off. - Foreman Scug 
	Spriggan Size Me!	 
Collect a Crescendal from an Insatiable Breaker or a Voracious Stalker at the Terrace of Formation.	Gut Check	The crescendal is a powerful tool created by automa. They are given to jiro when work is hard or important. When the devourers attacked, crescendals were likely... eaten. crescendals are strong. They do not easily damage. Check the stomachs of bigger devourers. Perhaps find one intact? 
Summon 4 Death Gates.	Gates of the Damned	We need to prepare for the assault before we signal Zerekriss. Once it is in place, our allies will use death gates to assault the area. We will need to summon the death gates on this side. Find strategic locations for them. 
Track the path to the Medallion of Wrath.	The Power of a Crown	We are ready. The Court of Harvesters shall use the power of the medallions we have gathered thus far to locate the Medallion of Wrath. So long as they have not removed it from the realm we should be able to divine its presence. This is not an easy ritual--the nathrezim specialize in avoiding detection. When you see the path, take it and move with speed. And when you find them, wait for us before you engage. 
Select a new steward companion, then return to Sika.	Your Next Best Friend	You looking for a new friend? Hoo-hoo! Lots of stewards who are happy to be friend. Plus, current friend can take break! Maybe go to Cliffs of Respite, rest feet, eat cake...<Sika gets lost in a daydream.>Hoo! Right! I call stewards. You make new friend! 
Assist Forgelite Sophone in crafting a piece of armor.	The Work of One's Hands	Too long have my hands been idle!<Forgelite Sophone smiles warmly at you.>You cannot know what this means to me, but I might be able to show you. For your aid in restoring my forge, please allow me to craft you a piece of armor. It will not be an extravagant affair, but through good works we grow to know ourselves better. I will need your aid once more. Sika and I will guide you on the specifics. All you need to do is listen and do as instructed. What do you say? 
Check on the Winter Queen.	Can't Turn Our Backs	That's Sylvanas and her Mawsworn dealt with... for now. But we need to hurry and make sure that the Queen and her sigil are safe! The Winter Queen was just outside the Heart of the Forest, protecting the stolen wildseeds from the Maw. 
Help Sabrina free Inquisitor Darksion.	The Last Word	Inquisitor Darksion was an aspiring practitioner of the arcane arts before Denathrius locked her away. I've heard she will share her knowledge with anyone that releases her from imprisonment. I want to learn all she knows! We must free her! 
Fight your way into Tirna Scithe and find the Horned Hunter.	Home of the Tirnenn	The Horned Hunter is no longer here. But I do know where he went. He tracked his prey to the west of here, in the Elder Stand. These woods in particular have grown dangerous as of late, and we are currently beset by invading devourers. They have overrun the roads between here and the Stand. I shall accompany you across the bridge, and see that you are delivered to the Horned Hunter. 
Restore 10 Wounded Covenant Allies in Seeker's Quorum.	We Need a Healer - You!	There are too many wounded on the battlefield! Not everyone can 'bash it and make better.' We need more healers. You, take my device and get our wounded back on their feet! 
Rescue Thrall from Torghast, Tower of the Damned.	Torment Chamber: Thrall	Using the totem you recovered, I will alter the Attuned Shard to guide you to Thrall's location.<Bolvar hands you the crystalline object.>Take care. You know the torments Baine and Lady Proudmoore endured in that accursed place. Thrall's confinement will be no less harrowing. Beware. The deeper you journey into the Tower of the Damned, the closer you get to the Jailer himself. Free Thrall, George... before all hope is lost. 
	Tracking Quest	 
Complete 1 quests in Perdition Hold and the Face of Oblivion.	Necrolord Assault	The Jailer's forces have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination! Your help is needed Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield! 
Bring the Ring of Self-Reflection to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Ring of Self-Reflection	<Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics. Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this ring in the Reliquary of Remembrance.> 
Find the key to free Darion.	The Brand Holds the Key	<Darion is unresponsive. The cage is locked, and doesn't appear easily broken. Perhaps the holder of the key is this ""Brand"" he mentioned.> 
Collect Temel's Head, Body, and Wings.	Rebuilding Temel	Revendreth demands penance from all, and it would appear that even you are not exempt.<Cryptkeeper Kassir grins.>Do not fear, I have no intention of exacting revenge for the violence you inflicted upon me. But I cannot offer you Temel either. The Lord Chamberlain--who you so wisely chose to install as master of these halls--deemed Temel a threat to his control. His thugs bashed Temel to bits and scattered the pieces among these crypts. It's not the first time I've had to rebuild him. 
	Tazavesh: Seek and Do Not Destroy	 
	Containing the Helsworn	 
	Centurions, Assemble!	 
	Tithe and Taxes	 
Deliver the item to Firim.	Aetheric Lattice	<Firim could make use of this item> 
Place the Aural Sequencers in Desmotaeron to help Ve'nari eavesdrop on the inhabitants.	Hearing Aid	How fortuitous! You just happened to be transferred to a location in which I have a certain... interest. Place the aural sequencers I gave you and I will attempt to establish a functional signal. Such a perilous location will require the utmost discretion. You will want to use your ethereal cloak to avoid being seen. 
	Alderyn and Myn'ir	 
Speak with Aithlyn at the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.	Supplies from The Wild Hunt	The Wild Hunt thanks you for your efforts in aiding Ardenweald. Take these gifts as recognition for your aid. May they help you in whatever trials may come. 
Use band posters to recruit 10 groupies and 10 roadies and recover 3 Confiscated Band Supplies.	Ember Court: Lost Chalice Band	Hips was smart to send you my way. The Lost Chalice Band plays the best music this side of the Maw! The band is not quite ready to tour yet, however. The musicians are all safe in the crypt behind me, but their instruments have been confiscated by our obnoxious neighborhood authorities! Noise complaints and all that. Help me get those back, and perhaps recruit a few groupies and roadies along the way to help out, and we shall throw the best concert your court has ever seen! 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Thenia's Loyal Companions	 
Travel to the Maw and rescue Lost Souls.	From a Dark Place	You rescued some of the night elves from the Maw before. While the danger is still great, I must ask you to do it again. I have to believe that we can save them. As many of them as possible. Please, go and see if you can recover any more lost souls. 
Assist Pelagos with the ascension ceremony.	Ascended	With success over their trials, our aspirants shall now start the next chapter of their afterlives. They have proven themselves through eons of training and cleansing, and will now earn ascendance. As each aspirant is called, I ask you and Pelagos to please assist by ushering them up. It is a tradition we have practiced for eons, reinforcing the bonds that we share. 
Find Partik.	Forest Disappearances	A moment of your time, friend? A short while ago a sylvar named Partik came seeking the aid of our grove. He said his village was under attack by the gorm and was in danger of crumbling away altogether. I told him we could not spare any soldiers, but their people were welcome to take refuge with us. However, it has been some time since he left and I have not seen or heard anyone from that region since. Can you go investigate? He came from the northeast. 
Join the Kyrian Covenant.	A Proper Reception	Though the path you follow is not that of a traditional ascended, it is a kyrian path all the same. To follow it is to bask in the footsteps of the innumerable lives before us, forever in service to a good far greater than we can achieve alone. To join us amidst such strife is an accomplishment worthy of recognition. Our Archon has called all among us to join her in welcoming you to our ranks. 
Witness the end of the spirit's life.	End of the Dream	The time has come. The ritual will be complete when you have fully entered into the spirit's dreams. It will be as if you are her, in every aspect. She relives the moment of her death over and over again. It torments her. Something about how she ended... she had no control over her actions. She hurt the ones she loved. Speak to me when you are ready to immerse yourself in her nightmare of the end. 
	Looking Fabulous	 
Gather the heads of fearsome foes to present to Baroness Vashj.	RSVP: Baroness Vashj	I am no stranger to courts, Maw Walker. Having attended on Queen Azshara herself, and then later serving my Lord Illidan. That does not mean, however, that I accept every invitation I receive.<Baroness Vashj smirks.>Impress me with your strength, $p, and I will believe Prince Renathal has power that is worth my time. 
Defeat 4 Mawsworn Shacklers and 6 Deadeyes at the Tremaculum in The Maw.	Disrupting the Cycle	The shacklers in the Tremaculum are an awful sort. Souls are tortured there until they turn malevolent. They are then outfitted as guards so the cycle can continue. If you wish to slow the rate at which the Jailer raises his armies, start at the source. Disrupt the cycle at the Tremaculum. 
Speak with the Voice of the Arbiter, Tal-Inara, in Oribos.	The End of the Beginning	<Renathal struggles to speak, his wounds evident.>I knew Denathrius had hoarded anima, but this... this is beyond imagining. The Jailer will surely use this power to shatter his bonds. Should he break free of the Maw, all the realms of Death will fall. We must continue to press the fight against Denathrius. Alas, we cannot hope to succeed alone. Return to Oribos with Draven and speak to the Honored Voice, Tal-Inara. Tell her what you have seen this day and implore her to action. 
Investigate the Heart of the Forest.	The Heart of Ardenweald	I hid my sigil in the Heart of the Forest, to keep it safe from the forces of the Maw. But the horn has called for aid. You and your allies go, see what has prompted the call. 
	Just Winging It	 
Slay 12 Brittlebark invaders in the Growthworks.	Idle Hands	If you want my help then you are going to need to help me first. There is a group of spriggans that have assaulted the growthworks to the northeast. They are causing all manner of havoc and I simply will not abide this trespass into my lands. Go there and teach them a lesson. If they will not flee, then slay them on the spot! 
Find Lady Moonberry in Revendreth.	Magical Mystery Tour!	<Lady Moonberry's voice rises from the scroll.>George! It seems Huln got into some trouble. And--well--it's complicated. We could really use your help in Revendreth! Please meet me at Dominance Keep. See you soon! 
Collect 3 Winding Seeds from the automa in the Blooming Foundry.	Strange Gears	<Oddly, the seed within the automa's innards is still very much alive. Are they all like this?> 
	Limbo	 
Defeat Grixis Tinypop in a pet battle.	Ashes Will Fall	 
Start a Sanctum Upgrade.	The First New Growth	Long have we lain dormant. With souls, with anima, we grow once more. A choice now awaits. How shall we grow? You may decide which flower blooms first. In time, with more anima and willing souls, the whole garden will prosper. For now, a single blossom signals hope for the future. Lady Moonberry will want to know of your choice. Seek her out once it is made. 
Destroy the Darkhaven and Manor carriages in Stonevigil Overlook.	Disrupting the Chain	From the desk of the Tithelord:All supply carriages must re-route to Stonevigil for collection assistance. Once complete, you may resume your regularly scheduled routes. 
	A Stolen Stone Fiend	 
Collect 8 Mawsworn Grimoires.	Mawsworn Rituals	The Mawsworn have a myriad of magic users among their forces. Their magic is unknown to us and that makes it deadly. We need to learn what they are capable of to properly prepare a defense. My own curiosity about their methods and rituals is secondary. Hunt down these vile casters and bring me their grimoires. 
Assist in examining Anduin's compass.	A Symbol of Hope	Before Anduin followed the Jailer through the gateway, he dropped something. I'm not sure what it was, but Jaina picked it up. Perhaps this is a sign that Anduin is still fighting back against the Jailer! We need to find out what this object was, and why the young king left it for us. 
Bring the Escapist Novel to Archivist Dreyden in the Grove of Memory.	An Escapist Novel	<Action, adventure, thrills, chills... This book has it all! Penned by a mortal soul who led an amazing life, this book is a page-turner. But is it true? Could one person fight conspiracies, ancient evils, vast enemy armies, demons and even gods in a single lifetime? On further reflection, it could be true, but what is a ""duck"" this book speaks of? That part sounds fake. Still... it was a good story. Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.> 
Use the Gormherd Branch on gorm in Gormhive to retrieve 50 Bulging Digestive Sacs.	Acid Reflux	We will need to be properly prepared before we can face Voras. The digestive juices of Ardenweald's gorm dissipate the anima in their food. Ingesting them causes devourers no small discomfort. For a beast of that size, we will need a lot of it to have any effect. There should be plenty of gorm in the hive to the east. Long ago, an artisan gave me a tool that he said would be useful against the gorm, should I ever need it. You may borrow it. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Bronze Helicid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Enable War Mode and slay 1 player within the world.	Observing the Chase	In our observations of your kind's conflict, we have noticed a high rate of escape among the prey. This is unadvantageous to our observation efforts. The Observer has acquired a tool we believe will improve your ability to force conflict. Before I give it to you, we ask that you prove your willingness to participate in such conflicts, so that we know we will receive a worthy return on this investment. 
Travel with Polemarch Adrestes to Elysian Hold.	Elysian Hold	One more step yet remains before your initiation is complete. You must now enter Elysian Hold, entryway to the rest of the Spires of Ascension and the vantage point from which the ascended safeguard Bastion and our aspirants in training. Once there, we shall ensure you are fully acquainted with the hold's offerings. Since you lack wings, I shall escort you there. 
Slay Mawsworn in the Endless Sands.	Oppress and Destroy	What we seek is in the vaults of the Endless Sands. To reach them will require strength and numbers. Together we will destroy the Mawsworn. I look forward to taking the fight directly to them. Remember, they will be vulnerable to the broken shard from the Helm of Domination. 
Activate 4 conductors within the Blooming Foundry.	Ramping Up	We must restore the Foundry's power to use it. Conductors will channel power so we can use it. We know how to use the conductors. Clear the way, and we shall start over. 
Meet Elder Ara at Pilgrim's Grace.	The Pilgrim's Journey	Pilgrim's Grace is a sacred site for the Enlightened. The Elders there have an intimate understanding of the creations of the First Ones. We will find answers there about these strange remnants we have found. Meet me at Pilgrim's Grace. It is not far. 
Clear out Sinfall and make it safe for Theotar and the other venthyr.	Securing Sinfall	They're all still active...The stoneborn, the gargon, the stone fiends... All of 'em! Don't got much time. They're always watching.<Breakfist points up.>Vulca told me to follow that big beam of Light in the sky. Goes to a tower guarded by a big old brute, though. Couldn't get in. 
Soulbind with Mikanikos.	An Earned Bond	There is one more thing you should do, Maw Walker. In rebuilding the Crest of Ascension you have earned more than just the trust of your fellow kyrian. It would seem our Forgelite Prime, Mikanikos, has rather enjoyed your time together and would like to soulbind with you. Given his predilection towards, well, himself, I am as surprised as you are. You must have truly impressed him. 
Drain the anima from the Forsworn Barrier Sources.	Lowering Their Defenses	We can alter the crown to expunge Denathrius's corruption in the medallions. Problem, Forsworn have set large barrier protecting the temple. Only there can Denathrius's influence be truly broken. Drain the anima from the barrier's sources that power it. Barrier will disappear. 
	A Matter of Stealth	 
Win any Path of Ascension trial as Kleia.	Path of Ascension: Kleia	Artemede has been personally training Kleia, running her through combat meditations and drills. She has come far, and she is prepared to take on another trial in the Path of Ascension. Return to the coliseum and guide her as her tactician so that she may reach victory. 
Read the Scrolls of Remembrance around Agthia's Repose.	In Agthia's Memory	Greetings, mortal! Are you here to learn about the legacy of Agthia, Paragon of Courage? I welcome you to walk the grounds of this ancient battleground to learn of the battle that occurred here, and the heroic Paragon who saved all of Bastion and the Shadowlands. 
See if you can gain any new insights from the trapped Soul Remnants in Torghast.	Remnants of Hope	I studied the key you brought back from Torghast, George. It confirms that Jaina Proudmoore is still being held somewhere in the tower. However we do not know precisely where. Countless souls are captive inside that wretched place. A few may be intact, but many are shattered and broken. Take pity upon the remnants and free those you can. Perhaps they will be able to aid our search. 
Kill the Unraveller and search it for clues.	Mawdified Behavior	There is a devourer in the cave. It creates a rift. This should not be possible in Zereth Mortis. Enter the cave and destroy the devourer. Search for clues. See how it can open a rift. Be careful. This one is different from others. It has absorbed the magic of the First Ones. This has never happened before. Be ready for anything. I will stay here and protect the jiro. 
Speak with Nalcorn Talsen at the Theater of Pain.	Supplies from The Undying Army	Your efforts meet with the approval of The Undying Army. These rewards are in recognition of those efforts. May they help you in the battles to come. 
Bring the Strange Runestone to Droman Tashmur in Tirna Vaal.	Unknown Assailants	This must be the stone he found. I do not recognize the mark. You should bring this to the nearby droman. They are wise and retain much of the knowledge of the forests and the realms beyond. They will know what to do. 
Ride Ragewing and destroy the enemy forces.	Enemy at the Door	The remaining houses of Maldraxxus have joined forces against us. Their armies besiege the Seat of the Primus, and our defenses cannot hold forever. Our reserves have met the enemy in battle. I need you to break the siege. Report to Heirmir and Marileth. They will give you the means to rain destruction on our foes. 
Complete the Terrors in Tirna Scithe World Quest, the Mists of Tirna Scithe Dungeon, or De Other Side Dungeon in Ardenweald.	Challenges in Ardenweald	Our close companions in Ardenweald face challenges unlike any that have previously plagued their peaceful glades. Ready your weapons, for now is the time that the golden shields of Bastion shine. Now is the time to take flight into the weald and show courage in the face of darkness. It is not always about us, you see. True courage means fighting for others when necessary, even against overwhelming odds and the most vile of evils. Light shines only in darkness. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Goldplate Bufonid	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Gather the Wild Hunt to Tirna Noch in Ardenweald.	Gathering The Hunt	Loath as I am to aid Bwonsamdi, Mueh'zala must be made to answer for his crimes. We will eradicate his worshippers and drive them from the forest before they cause more harm. Rally the groves and muster the Wild Hunt. Ardenweald has need of its protectors. Make haste, <huntsman/huntress>. 
Rescue Jaina Proudmoore from Torghast.	Torment Chamber: Jaina	<Bolvar studies the objects you acquired from the brokers in Torghast.>I sense Lady Proudmoore's magic upon this debris. And these notes describe methods to contain her power.<The Highlord focuses on the items, peering into the darkness.>By the Light! They are tormenting her with white-hot fires. Though her will is strong, there is only so much any mortal can endure. I will modify Ve'nari's Attuned Shard using the items you returned. You must find her, $p. Before it is too late. 
Help Emeni slaughter everyone on her list.	The Slaughter Daughter	When I was locked up, I made a list of all the constructs that betrayed me... it is a lengthy list! Help me teach these constructs the mistake they made. I want to destroy everyone on my list, along with Yardmaster Pralak, who is number one on the list! 
Find somewhere to plant Marasmius in the Heart of the Forest.	Through the Veil	I like you, youngling. You put in the work while the others sit in their fancy court, leaving old Marasmius to keep the fae rings thriving. Here, take one of my spores back with you to the Heart of the Forest. Find somewhere nice and cozy for me to rest, will you? Come back and visit me whenever you like. Cort and I can keep an eye on things for now, but there will always be plenty for you to do here. Might even be something special in it for you. 
Kill Zel'han the Betrayer and recover his armor.	The Problem with Containing a Death Loa	Me know Mueh'zala still be hidin' someting. Ol' Bwonsamdi gonna find out what dat be. But dis old loa's presence be drawin' all da undead in Nazmir ta me doorstep! Me be needin' some time ta get Mueh'zala talkin'. Dere be a troll, Zel'han, leadin' da undead. Kill him and show Mueh'zala him broken armor. Dat should end any hope he be havin' of escapin'. 
Gather the suspects and meet Lajos in the large crypt.	And Then There Were None	Ilka and Samu argued, you say? And you found a coded message indicating that the tithe was going to be sent out soon. Those are helpful clues that will allow me to put the puzzle together. It's clear to me now who betrayed the village and what we need to do about it! You deliver invitations to a meeting to our suspects and I'll prepare to reveal the traitor. 
Meet Prince Renathal and Baroness Draka at Stonevigil Overlook.	Stonevigil Unrest	Greetings, George. I'm sure you've met my associate, Baroness Draka. I have recruited her to help us with the growing threat of the Tithelord. His involvement with the Maldraxxi renegades is troubling. One conspiracy begets another. So I recruited Draka to help us end it. We must not treat this situation lightly. We first need to put an end to his oppression of Stonevigil Overlook. That way we can we win over the hearts and minds of his subjects. 
Slay Oracle Zoketh and Oracle Voraxxi.	Cleaving A Path	Maw Walker! My scouts report that the Mawsworn have dominated two automa Oracles to aid them in battle. These Oracles will most certainly predict our strategy and our ultimate goal, if given the chance. We need to eliminate both Oracles before we enter the Crypts. With them out of the way, the Mawsworn troops won't know what we're doing until we're finished with it. Take Emeni with you. She's eager for battle. 
Reach the Standing Stone.	Through the Fire and Flames	Margrave Krexus was pleased to hear of your service to our house. He senses great potential within you. Potential that must be tested. A stone stands at the center of our citadel, surrounded by magma. Reaching the stone is a challenge of endurance and fortitude. This trial is usually attempted only by our most renowned soldiers, but Margrave Krexus commands you to attempt the rite at once. Go on, then. Prove your worth. 
Collect 3 Coins of Brokerage from rare monsters and treasure chests in the Shadowlands.	Rare Resources	Hello! Yes! Hello. Brokers, you know them? <Sika does her best attempt at looking like a broker. It is not convincing.>Trade many things with us. Things we no get. Things we want. Need coins. Clink clink!<Sika makes a circle with her finger feathers.>Find them everywhere, bring them to Sika! 
Find Zayhad in the Roots of the Heart of the Forest.	Who Shapes the Forest	You have fulfilled your calling, Maw Walker, and brought calm to our forest. Stay vigilant, for others will similarly call upon you in time. The anima you have recovered will be of great use to the Heart of the Forest. Bring it to Zayhad. They will ensure it is safe until it is needed. You will find them deep in the roots of the Heart of the Forest. 
Inform Tal-Inara in Oribos of Maldraxxus's attack on Bastion.	Follow the Path	Maldraxxus must answer for their crimes against Bastion. There shall be justice! Let us go to Oribos and speak with the Tal-Inara, the Honored Voice. We will tell her what has transpired this day. Tell her that the kyrian will not stand idle against this aggression. Artemede will inform the Archon. My brothers and sisters will surely prepare for war. That must not come to pass. 
Collect 8 Maldraxxian Weapons.	Maldraxxian Weapons	<The weapon you find seems unlike those wielded by most venthyr, yet the marks it bears are unmistakably familiar...It would be wise to seek out more such weapons and bring them to the Accuser.> 
Investigate the temple wards in Elysian Hold.	The Wards of Bastion	Each temple of Bastion is protected by a ward here in Elysian Hold. As long as the wards hold, no malevolent force can launch an assault. It is concerning that the Forsworn were able to attack Purity in such force...Your orders are to examine the wards. As long as they hold, Bastion stands strong. 
Revive Chelra the Bladewall and drive enemies out of Darkwall Tower.	The Princeguard	Renathal carries himself well, but hides great pain. His wounds from Denathrius have not healed. He is vulnerable. He intends to send you to secure his old fortress of Darkwall Tower with banners and rely on his own strength to deter enemies. This is a poor tactical choice. Take this small reserve of anima with you and revive Chelra the Bladewall. She was last seen at Darkwall. Revive her and she can aid you in taking the tower. 
Rescue 20 Souls in the Maw.	Return More Lost Souls	Souls continue to pour into the Maw. I see no reason you cannot pull even more souls from the abyss. Return to the Maw and find me even more worthy of redemption. 
Transcribe 10 Infernal Cryptograms.	Cryptograms	If the nathrezim have infiltrated Sinfall they will be communicating, and not just through hand gestures or spoken words. They like to use magical written messages concealed by a simple cantrip, invisible to the average observer. However, I have developed an incantation that should allow you to see these messages. Find these cryptograms and bring me their contents. I can translate them if they are beyond your understanding. 
Search for the Fatescribe of Korthia.	A Matter of Urgency	Maw Walker, there is a matter of urgency that has not been addressed. Our Fatescribe is missing. They have not found their way here. They would have been in Seeker's Quorum before...<Pathscribe Roh-Vess pauses.>Can you look for the Fatescribe? Many attendants used the caves near the ruins to hide from the mawsworn. 
Use the Overcharged Champion to destroy 6 Deadsoul Pylons along the walls of Perdition Hold.	Clearing the Walls	<This scroll shows the locations of a series of pylons, that protect Perdition Hold from assault. Destroying these Pylons could aid in the success of our attack> 
Bring the Wandering Tale to Archivist Dreyden in the Grove of Memory.	A Wandering Tale	<This book might have a point, but the author is taking every possible detour along the way. Or maybe it's about the journey and not the destination...In any case, Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.> 
Use the Kinematic Micro-Life Recalibrator to ""recalibrate"" Malfunctioned Poultrids in the Great Veldt.	Cluck, Cluck, Boom	The endemic poultrids of Zereth Mortis have been influenced in an unseemly way by all these invaders. Use this device on the ones that have malfunctioned. Otherwise, they will do too much damage to the land. 
Meet Secutor Mevix near the House of Constructs.	Army of One	Mevix will lead the attack, but you will finish it. There are no reinforcements, no cavalry. Only you and your runeblade. Show me the might you wield, outsider. Lay siege to the House of Constructs and bring them to ruin! 
Obtain the Mark of Humility from within the First Chamber of Kalliope.	Mark of Humility	Quartermaster, you've arrived. Those fools over there still haven't gotten past the first barrier. We need to get into that cave to have any chance at recovering the Spear of Kalliope. Our research discovered the phrase, ""Only the humble find their way. Even heroes kneel before virtue."" But those fools have been working on that clue for ages. Go figure out the problem and get inside that cave. We need its mark to open the final vault. 
Heal 10 wounded sylvar in the Banks of Life.	Unsafe Workplace	You've returned just in time! Fae are in danger! It seems our actions have enraged the gorm. They are even more aggressive than they were before! While some fae were able to evacuate, there are still many who are trapped down there. Take this jar and slather anyone you find with a generous helping. That should heal their wounds and give them a chance to escape. 
Aid the Wild Hunt in their fight against the forces of Mueh'zala.	Cleansing the Forest	The Winter Queen has commanded us to drive Mueh'zala's forces out of Ardenweald. This won't be an easy battle. The death loa's army is strong, and several of our hunters have been gravely injured. Can we count on you to turn the tide in our favor, George? Aid our fallen allies and vanquish Mueh'zala's minions! 
Assist Firim.	Give Me A Hand	To drive the Jailer from Zereth Mortis, we must direct all our resources against the enemy. An object of potential power lies in a nearby repository, but the chamber's defenses respond only to automa. I would never harm their kind, but I have encountered one that no longer functions. If you extract its hand, we could use the inert appendage to gain access to the repository. I find such use of the First Ones' creations unsavory, but we cannot abide the presence of Mawsworn in this realm. 
Slay Etherwyrms to collect 25 Glowing Viscera.	The Cycle of Anima: Etherwyrms	Forge is cold, yes? Need LOTS of anima to light.<Sika references her scroll.>Times before now, anima is everywhere, yes? Now it hides. Small bits, weird places. We know that etherwyrms -- flappy scale-things that are blue -- eat anima. They are not dead, so they are finding anima to eat still, yes? Maybe if we take what they have eaten, we can use it to light the forge. This will probably kill them. Sad, yes. But! We will not take too much. Just a little. 
	Odalrik	 
Collect anima from the village for the tithe.	Bring Out Your Tithe	Unfortunately the Lord Chamberlain's gift isn't sufficient to cover the entire tithe we're expected to provide the Tithelord, but it will make a good start. The loss of the tithe convoy is a terrible blow to our village. Our little community is already suffering greatly from the drought and the need to meet the Tithelord's demands. Still we must all do our part. We have little time to accomplish this task. Can you help? Get the tithe from villagers and scour the area for every forgotten drop. 
Take Shandris Feathermoon and the rescued night elf souls to Ysera at the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.	Their New Home	It pains me to leave my mother behind... but the souls of my people must be brought to safety. I heard the attendants in Oribos speaking of a place called Ardenweald. A realm of ancient forests where the spirits of nature slumber. This is a land you know well, is it not? I would see its wonders with my own eyes. Perhaps the spirits there will know how to save my minn'do from the Night Warrior's power. 
Use the Anima Conduits to restore the Mnemonic Locus.	The Mnemonic Locus	<Mikanikos examines the scroll you retrieved for him.>Right, right. Soul mirrors and Locus are tied together. If we restore anima to mirrors, it should repair the Locus back to full functionality. Thankfully, the cores you brought should be sufficient. All I need to do is enable conduits. Simple! Well? Go on. You know how to use these, yes? 
	Major Mirror Disruptions	 
Collect the 3 Shards of the Countess.	Shards of the Countess	The venthyr travel long distances through enchanted mirrors. The keys we look for are not as we have in Bastion, but rather shards of a mirror that will lead to the sinstone's location. Based on the intel you found, we know which three houses hold these shards. Primrose, Darkvein, and Sinfang. Go to their manors and retrieve the shards. We will find the frame to piece them into. 
Enter the Theater of Pain dungeon, and defeat the champions within.	Theater of Pain: Help Wanted	Oh, bother--the Lich champion has withdrawn from the contest. Well, then... It appears we have an opening! Would anyone like to enter in her stead? Perhaps to increase the odds for their house? Anyone? Oh, George! So kind of you to volunteer. No better way to get experience than to just jump right in unprepared! Remember, we can't all be winners. 
Cross the Bridge of Defiance on foot.	Harvester of Wrath	We walk in the winged shadows of my brothers and sisters in arms, Stoneborn I have trained since they were first carved from stone. This is an ancient rite. If we cross this bridge on foot, defeating any who would dare stop us, we may have an audience with the mother of the stoneborn. However, know that our safe return is not guaranteed, so try not to offend her. I do not look forward to this. 
Travel with Bwonsamdi to the Necropolis in Nazmir.	Something Extra for the Winter Queen	Ya did good wit' how ya handled Mueh'zala. Me be wantin' ta return da favor. We be friends, after all... riiiight? Dat nasty loa be at me mercy now. Him been mutterin' about some tings he stole from ya Winter Queen. Come along ta me Necropolis. Ya can see what Ol' Bwonsamdi be talkin' about for yaself. Ya gonna come back with someting nice for her majesty... reeeeeal nice. 
Defeat Mistress Dyrax in the Theater of Pain, when she appears.	Bet On Yourself	Dear Maw Walker... my friend... you're going to lose. Everyone knows you can't compete in the arena. The entire Challenger's Promenade knows it, the brokers in Oribos know it, even Zo'umlo knows it. I've brought in a special challenger just to prove the point. Face Mistress Dyrax in the Theater of Pain and prove us wrong... or prove us right. We will be betting, so don't disappoint. 
Collect 18 Feather Caps, 24 Lacy Bell Morels, and 4 Violet Frills.	Ember Court: Mushroom Surprise!	I had not realized the fame of my fungi had reached so far. I'd be delighted to provide a mushroom feast to the Ember Court! Hmmm... I will need you to collect some rare specimens and will loan you my favorite foraging bag. It will help you find the very best fungi. It's never failed me. Let's see, I need tiny lacy bells from Bastion and some of those Ardenweald fancy purple frills. From the very tops of our mushrooms here I will need the feather caps. You'll need to grapple your way up there. 
Escort Uther.	Kyrestia's Grace	I remember this particular soul...Uther. Devos brought him before us some time ago. She pleaded her case about his soul having a connection to the Maw. She then took him under wing, ascending him before he was ready. He became her other hand alongside Lysonia, as it were. He may proclaim a change of heart, but we shall see. Place him under guard. He may stay by the Archon's grace, but I will not take any chances with one so...broken. 
Place a heart in Emenis' construct.	A Good Heart	Despite the beliefs of most people, Emeni has a kind heart. Err...at least she will have one, once you give it to her! I can think of no one better than you, Maw Walker, to give Emeni a new heart. Perhaps this will warm her blood towards you. You might become friends or even soulbinds! Please select and place a heart in Emeni's construct. 
Order Temel to read from Inquisitor Stelia's sinstone, then kill her.	Herald Their Demise	Since the dawn of Revendreth, Temel has been charged with proclaiming the sins of souls for all to hear. Every soul here, including venthyr, has been forced to endure his wrathful pronouncements on at least one occasion. He will know how to wield Inquisitor Stelia's sinstone to break through her defenses. Simply command him to do so after you locate the inquisitor, and eliminate her. 
Ride with Firim out of the Genesis Repository.	The Road to Haven	I did not expect to encounter a living mortal and a kyrian this day, but your assistance has been valuable. Before I begin my studies of this automa core, I will guide you to Haven, the settlement founded by my expedition upon our arrival. Though my colleagues saw fit to exile me for challenging their ""Enlightened"" dogma, I have no wish to see Haven wiped from existence by the Jailer. Aid them and they may assist your efforts to return to your allies. We brokers are nothing if not transactional. 
Help Protector Kah-Rev defeat the invading Mawsworn.	Defending the Vault	To reach the vault, we'll need to carve a path through the attacking Mawsworn. The covenants are doing their best to drive off these monstrosities, but our allies can't hold out forever. The Mawsworn are intent on reaching the prize before you. We could use your help fighting against the Jailer's forces, Maw Walker. Purpose guide us all. 
Speak with Duchess Mynx at Keeper's Respite in Korthia.	Supplies from Death's Advance	Your work toward stopping the Jailer's advances has not gone unnoticed. If it is power you seek to continue your efforts I believe I can be of some assistance. 
Report to the Primus in the Geometric Cavern.	Two Paths to Tread	Did that answer your question? Oh, you wanted a way to completely resist Domination magic? That I'm afraid I do not know. The First Ones' language will only delay the inevitable. What I can tell you is that if you want to find more deliciously complex phrases of the First Ones' language, you should go to the Endless Sands and search the vaults. I wish I could go myself, but it has been overrun by those nasty Mawsworn. Good luck with the rest of your studies! 
Return to Oribos.	Words of the Primus	Even in his absence, the wisdom of the Primus rings true. This message must have been put here to await one who proved worthy of hearing it.<Draka peers at you.>You came to Maldraxxus to learn why Bastion was invaded. Now you know that there is treachery in our ranks. And that there are noble souls here who will set things right. Tell your allies in Oribos all you have witnessed. See that the warning of the Primus reaches the Eternal Ones. It would be an honor to fight by your side again, George. 
Slay Noisul of Many Faces	Save Ol' Gertie	We have to find Ol' Gertie! She is the broodmother of the silkstriders, and is our most reliable producer. We cannot lose her. But I cannot get to her and see if she is all right. She is usually at the top of the cliffs, at the highest point. Can you get up there, and make sure that she is safe? If she is not... then may justice fall swift and hard on the perpetrator. 
Signal the Zerekriss and start the assault.	A Job Done Right	We should be clear to start the assault. Signal the Zerekriss. Let us show them the might of a Maldraxxian necropolis and the combined armies of the Shadowlands! 
Add the Conduits to the Forge of Bonds, then apply one to a slot on Pelagos.	A Conduit for Good	While the gifts your bond shall bring you are substantial, you may also empower yourself further through the use of conduits. Conduits act to channel the energy of your soulbind into your form more directly, increasing your potential in a myriad of ways. Use the ones I have given you as a test of this power, but fear not--you will find others as you aid the Shadowlands. 
Enter the Maw to find Prince Renathal.	Prince Renathal	You! They say you are a Maw Walker. Well, time to put that to the test. My master, Prince Renathal, was the one who started the rebellion. He knew Denathrius was working towards something truly nefarious, and attempted to stop him. The rebellion failed, and Renathal was flung into the Maw. I propose you and I venture into the Maw. There is an old device here that only you will be able to use. Together, we can recover my Prince. You need him, if you are to have any hope of success. 
Collect 9 Runeforged Shackles and return them to Ve'nari in the Maw.	Acquisition: Runeforged Shackles	<The chains here are carved with domination runes, imbuing them with the magic needed to subdue the most powerful of the Mawsworn's prisoners. No doubt Ve'nari could find some use in studying these runes.> 
Escort Saezurah to the center of the Crypts of the Eternal.	The Infinite Circle	Creation calls--can you hear it? Yet darkness lingers below, taints the ancient melody. To forge anew, peace must be restored. The Walker must walk, and protect. There is much to be done. Lead the way. 
Find a way to create a new Arbiter.	For Every Soul	Without the Arbiter to stem the flow of souls to the Maw, the Shadowlands will never be fully repaired. This cannot be the end. Surely you can think of something? 
Enter the Ember Court, then give orders to one of the specialist staff members.	The Professionals	Smart move bringing in the specialists, $p. Once you get into this week's Ember Court, be sure to let the specialists know what you want them to do. Breakfist down in the dredger pools can smash or clean things to make the court more Messy or Clean for you. Crooked Crick in the refreshments area can adjust Decadence. Lady Ilinca in the embassy area can adjust Formality. Cosmin the Illusionist on stage can adjust Excitement. Wing Commander Vulpek at the front gates can adjust Danger. 
Deliver invitations to each of the noble houses within the Redelav District.	An Invitation to Treachery	While the missive made it clear that Andrei is displeased with my position, nothing in the letter identifies his co-conspirator. All we really know is that they are trying to gain access to my soiree this evening so they can carry out their plans. Let's make it easy for them, shall we? Head into the Redelav District and deliver an invite to the prominent houses. This way, we'll be sure the traitors show up. 
Rescue 5 record keepers from Scholar's Den.	The Knowledge Keepers	Our vault was built to store countless secrets and artifacts. Even if we gain entrance, we can't be certain of what the Jailer is looking for. Certain attendants are given the title of record keeper. They track items stored in the vault, and are known for their utmost discretion. A number of keepers have been taken captive by the Mawsworn and are being tortured for information. Save the record keepers, George. They can help us determine what the Banished One seeks. 
Search the Seeker's Quorum for the missing Fatescribe.	The Last Place You Look	I came here hoping to locate the Fatescribe or something to help me find him. Evidence shows he was here and survived a Mawsworn attack. The only other place I haven't looked is a meditation chamber on the opposite side of the ruins. It's too dangerous for me to head back into the Seeker's Quorum alone. Could you help me? I must find the Fatescribe. It's a matter of great importance. 
Attune with Darion and Alexandros and assist them in leaving the Maw.	Maw Walker	I believe now it is time for you to leave. You are a Maw Walker, one who can activate the waystone between the Maw and the lands beyond. While your friends may not hold the same title, there is a way to send them through the gate. Souls can be connected. In theory, if you let someone attune themselves to your soul while you activate the waystone, you both should be able to leave. Even fleeting connections may produce some result. Go with your other two guests and see if my hypothesis is correct. 
Retrieve 7 Drab Gromits.	Gold's No Object	$p! How's things? We 'eard there was all kinds of interestin' stuff out 'ere. So, 'em sneakin' hoppers? Hard to see, innit? They've got 'emselves a shiny pelt as me 'n' the lads could use to stay out of sight, as it were. You know, avoid the bosses n' such. I need ya to capture a bundle of 'em. Gold's no object, just bring me the little pests alive. 
Locate Skewering Needles, Razorthread Spools and Clotting Patches.	Loose Threads	We're missing a few tools and parts for sewing a construct. We need these items if we're to rebuild my construct! Search the surrounding area. See if you can find us what we need. Search tables for the Skewering Needles, you can find haulers that carry Razorthread Spools, and look for Clotting Patches on constructs you kill. 
Summon the Paragons to call them to action.	Convene the Paragons	We have defeated the Forsworn at every turn. Saved those not too far gone. Routed them from our blessed Archon's temples. Now only one remains. The Temple of Loyalty. Lysonia has grown desperate in defeat. Abandoned all we strive to uphold by embracing the Maw. She has rallied her most fervent loyalists to the temple, knowing we will come for her. We shall need the Paragons to finish this. Summon them. 
Search the Tranquil Pools for missing loa pods.	Taking Inventory	Dark forces be at work, Mechanic. Ardenweald be where loa go ta be reborn after dey die on Azeroth. But some of da loa who be sleepin' in Ardenweald have gone missin'!Gotta be someone powerful behind it, takin' dem from right under da Winter Queen...Ol' Bwonsamdi can't be havin' loa vanishin' from Ardenweald. Dat could be me someday! No, no... we gonna put a stop to dis! Go back ta Ardenweald and search for da missin' loa. 
Increase your Renown.	House of Rituals	The Ritualists are the ones behind this war. Every act of treason has been committed under their orders. We cannot defeat their sorcery with strength of arms alone. Victory will hinge on our knowledge of what they are plotting. Continue to bolster our forces. I will look for a way to infiltrate the House of Rituals. 
Bring the Blueprint: Herald's Footpads to Dactylis.	Herald's Footpads	Sometimes, sheer force of will is not enough. A piece of equipment can save your life. This blueprint you found can teach you to craft your first piece of equipment. Bring it over to Dactylis. She will be able to aid you in this as well. 
Kill 3 rare or special encounter bosses in The Maw.	Storm the Maw	We have been able to do little to stem the flood of souls into the maw, until now. You, Maw Walker, have the power to put a stop to this. We know little about the Jailer's lands, save that he is powerful beyond imagining. I ask something of you today that I would not place upon anyone else. You must travel to his lands, and do what you can to slow the growth of his forces. We must buy more time. 
Visit Vilo, the Enlightened Quartermaster, to see what is available.	Legendary Assistance	George, we have convinced the Enlightened Brokers to provide additional supplies for the battle against the Jailer! 
Assist covenant forces from the air at the Vault of Secrets.	Flight of the Kyrian	We've engaged in a heavy battle at the entrance to the Vault of Secrets! Our forces could use some reinforcement. Please, guide my fellow Ascended to give support to our fighters there. The fighters on the ground can handle the clean-up, but they need shields and healing. Good luck! 
Examine the Vessel and the Automa Scryers.	The Turning Point	A pause, devoid of breath. A melody lingers on. The cycle awaits a voice.<You are unsure of what Saezurah means. Perhaps you should try to set up the ritual again, starting with the Vessel and the scryers.> 
Challenge Athanos.	Assessing Your Spirit	It is clear to all that you are indeed a skilled combatant. There is one challenge here that continues to test even the strongest among us. I would have you attempt to best a well-known centurion, beloved by all aspirants. It is called Athanos. Consider this a test of your spirit. If you can withstand this trial, then I will deem you ready for what lies ahead. 
Speak with Bolvar Fordragon in Oribos.	Hopeful News	The terms of our bargain have been met. You may depart with the souls you acquired. Perhaps the fate of this ""Baine"" is of interest to you or your allies. I suggest you return to Oribos and consult them. No need to rush. After all, those held within Torghast are tortured for centuries. Kindly remember not to tell anyone about our arrangement. Discretion is key between business partners, after all. 
Use Summon Steward to fix the Beacon of Invocation, then use it to summon Polemarch Adrestes.	Steward at Work	Stewards are useful for many reasons. They keep Bastion tidy, fix anything broken, and offer unrivaled companionship and support. Your new steward assistant should be able to repair the beacon. Then you can summon the Polemarch to Hero's Rest. 
Bring the Pig Soul to Choofa in the Heart of the Forest.	Pig Soul	<The Pig Soul is curious and tenacious. The shape of the pig will be yours to call upon.> 
Deliver the item to Firim.	Aeon Matrix	<Firim could make use of this item> 
Collect 12 Crimson Pages, then bring them to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.	Book of Binding: The Mad Witch	<You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover crimson pages. Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing. If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.> 
Deliver the missive to Duchess Mynx in Keeper's Respite in Korthia.	A Defector's Request	<Unrolling the scroll, you can make out that it's a coded arms requisition from the Maldraxxi of Death's End to their venthyr allies... all servants of the Jailer. Surely someone among the Death's Advance in Korthia will be able to help you fully break the code and learn exactly what they were planning.> 
Defeat the Archivist.	Archival Protection	The rarest volumes are kept at the top of this tower, protected by an entity called the Archivist. This stoic guardian is incorruptible. Intractable. Completely uninterested in striking a fair bargain! Its utter lack of business acumen is really quite upsetting. Ah, well. I fear we have no choice but to dispatch this impediment. Shall we? 
Collect cheeses from Bastion and Sourbread Yeast Starter from Maldraxxus.	Small Bites	The reviews are in, $p. Our menu is too Revendreth-centric! All the best courts have exotic appetizers, small plates, and other specialties that guests can look forward to every time they come. And for a court like ours, which boasts frequent guests from other realms, we simply must do better! Do not worry, after tireless research, I have drafted a very particular list of ingredients for you to find me. Bring them to me, and I will serve our guests eternity on a platter! 
Kill Viscount Nicolae and reclaim Thornhill Manor.	Reclaiming Thornhill Manor	I've done some digging and discovered that Viscount Nicolae is the new inhabitant of Thornhill Manor. A vile thing, he is. It'll take us weeks to rid the estate of his stench! Hopefully, you can rid us of him in a much timelier fashion. I'll gather the rest of the staff and together we can reclaim Thornhill Manor. 
Fix 5 defense nodes.	This is Your Fault, Fix It	Provis Fauna is normally regulated by autonomous constructs, but there have been reports that they are no longer working. According to the reports, you are the one responsible for the tampering of these nodes. Which means it is on you to fix them. Take this tuner, it should help--and once they are repaired, do not meddle with them again. 
Gain an audience with the Winter Queen.	Winter Be Comin'	Da boss be puttin' together an army of terrible loa. Hakkar and Dambala may only be da beginnin'. How da boss get so strong? I not be seein' him use power like dis before...Da Winter Queen not be fond of ol' Bwonsamdi, but we gonna need her help to stop Mueh'zala. Ya be friendly wit' da Queen, no? If she be willin' to rally her forces, we might be able to stop Mueh'zala before it be too late. Head to da Heart of da Forest and speak wit' da Queen. She be our only hope now. 
Complete 3 World Quests in Ardenweald.	A Calling in Ardenweald	Ardenweald is fractured, its roots strangled. Before we can begin to regrow our glades, we must unearth the evils that have festered here. We call to you, today, to defend our forests. Take the weald paths through our lands, aiding our allies and defeating our enemies. With these actions, we will renew our forces, and rebuild our anima. In time, hope will blossom. Our trust is in you, our newest seedling. 
Obtain one of Stradama's Lost Ledgers from Margrave Stradama in Plaguefall.	Trading Favors: Plaguefall	Is is such a shame what happened to poor Margrave Stradama. Just between us, she was once one of our most favored trading partners. When things get lost in Maldraxxus they tend to end up at the bottom of her blighted pools. You would not, perhaps, be interested in continuing this relationship on her behalf? We would, of course, compensate you quite well. I am sure she has little use for these possessions in her current state. 
Speak with Hips to see your Entertainment options, then complete Gresit's quest to earn the rituals contract.	Ember Court: Entertainment	Everyone loves entertainment! Our first guest is from the Halls of Atonement, so he will certainly appreciate a presentation of the powerful rituals the Accuser is capable of. Work with Hips to acquire everything we need to host atoning rituals at the Ember Court. 
Present the schematic to an appropriate protoform forge.	Schematic Reassimilation: Darkened Vombata	<This schematic contains the pattern of a new protoform construct. Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these creatures for you.> 
Collect 5 articles of venthyr clothing from Chalice Residents and Garment Trunks in the Chalice District.	Gothic Fashion	Making my way into the city unseen was not as simple as I thought. I trekked through some mud, where I came across these... small men. Perhaps Kleia is right. I draw far too much attention here to be of much use. Perhaps I can disguise myself? Please, help me by gathering some venthyr clothing as a disguise. 
Secure the area and recover Atticus's Supply Ledger and 10 Ossein Battlemail	Supply Chain	My friend! I could sure use your expertise right now. One of our wagon convoys was attacked nearby! It was transporting critical supplies... and new goods for me to sell! It's important--no--vital, that we recover as much of that equipment as possible. So, you ready to go? Let's head out and salvage what we can! 
Find Elder Eru outside the Lexical Glade.	Elder Eru	Since we have earned the trust of the Enlightened, I have learned more about their explorations into Zereth Mortis. They know more than they are willing to tell, but often do not act on that knowledge. Perhaps where they observe, we can be a catalyst for action. In a secluded corner called the Lexical Glade, there is an elder named Eru. She may be able to give us insight on how we might use the language of the First Ones. Seek her out, and see if she will help us. 
	Allay Their Fears	 
	Save the Vombata	 
Seek out Laurel the Heart of the Forest.	Keeper of Great Renown	As you grow in renown across the Shadowlands, the Heart of the Forest shall grow with you. Seek out Laurel, our Keeper of Renown. She will acquaint you with the magic that we bestow upon our huntsmen and huntresses. 
Ride Bron, then defeat 30 Forsworn forces and dismantle 2 Colossus in the Eternal Forge.	Dismantling the Opposition	The Forsworn mobilize! We cannot allow them to march. Attune to Bron, share your power with him. Between the three of us, we shall destroy this new centurion army! 
Find the missing journal pages.	A Desperate Solution	<A well-made, if well-worn, journal catches your eye. Thumbing through the pages, it is clear that this journal once belonged to someone prominent from this group of night fae. The last few pages are torn out of the book. Perhaps if the rest of the pages were located then Partik could help decipher what happened here.> 
Return to the Seat of the Primus with the Pauldrons of Imperium.	Pauldrons of Imperium	Now we know who is responsible for the unrest in Maldraxxus. If Kel'Thuzad has allied with the Banished One, then he wields greater power than anyone realizes. We must lay siege to the House of Rituals, but we need time to prepare. Attacking without a flawless strategy will only ensure our defeat. For now, return the pauldrons to the Seat of the Primus. I will meet you there. 
	Lost Journals	 
Speak to Haephus.	It's All Coming Together	Our brothers and sisters are spread thin fighting the Forsworn, maintaining order among aspirants waiting to ascend, and countless other duties. The willing souls you recovered from the Maw will be a great boon to our capabilities in these dire times. Go to Haephus at once--he has long been searching for aid in activating some of our sanctum's most powerful features. It is time we saw Elysian Hold brought to its full potential. 
Recover a Treasonous Missive from a Redelav Courier.	Killing the Messenger	I make it my business to know what is going on within my district. Traditionally we use stone fiends to relay messages, but my informants have alerted me to some suspicious communications going on within the Old Gate. A venthyr has been hired to run missives between two undisclosed parties. When someone puts that much effort into concealing their identity, it can never be good. Find this courier and recover whatever missives they might be carrying. 
Participate in the ritual of judgment.	Ritual of Judgment	After all rituals of absolution are complete, each soul must face its final judgment in Revendreth. There are three potential verdicts:If proven unworthy, it is condemned to the Maw for eternity. If fully absolved of its sins, it is either elevated to a venthyr or returned to the Arbiter to be assigned its new destination. Our most sacred ritual, the judgment, determines this fate. One such ritual is happening now. I will disguise you and we will participate to ensure a just verdict. 
Deliver Intact Aquilon Core to Deos in Keeper's Respite.	Intact Aquilon Core	<The massive devourer was clutching this aquilon power core in its fist when it died, no doubt ripped from one of the destroyed aquilon around it. The power core appears to be almost entirely intact. Deos in Keeper's Respite would be able to help you locate an aquilon that you could power with it.> 
Bring the Sisters' Tear to Ysera at the Heart of the Forest.	Winter's Sigil	My sister... After all this time... She did not abandon me...<The barest hint of a smile graces the Winter Queen's face before it is gone. She turns her attention to you with the weight of eons.>Attend me, George. Take my sister's tear, and come to the Heart of the Forest. 
Report to Polemarch Adrestes.	Report to Adrestes	You have chosen well. The Kyrian have long ferried souls across the veil into the Shadowlands, ensuring a steady supply of anima for all the realms. Their sacred purpose must be kept strong. Speak with Polemarch Adrestes and begin your future with your covenant. 
Collect Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons from Overseer Atticus.	Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons	Sika reports the Forsworn are widespread. They not only took over production, but the rise as well! They organize their armies from the cliffs, send word back to their leaders. They've ransacked our shrine to the First Forgelite and took her hammer. My hammer! Defeat their commander, retrieve Phaestus. You must go now! 
Report to Baroness Draka at the Seat of the Primus in Maldraxxus.	Taking The Seat	A wise choice, George. Under your command, we will restore honor and glory to Maldraxxus. Your strength can change the Shadowlands for the better. Only with the Necrolords will you reach your full potential. For now, make your way to the Seat of the Primus. Baroness Draka will meet you there and guide you further. 
Search Gharmal's Tower.	Gharmal's Tower	Gharmal collected anything they believed to be an item of power. We'll need to search the tower. There is almost certainly something here of value to us. 
Collect the lost pages of Marileth's journal from Plague-doused Remnants.	Applied Science	<What appears to be an old journal sits on Marileth's table, now mangled and missing pages. The entries that are legible seem to have been written by Marileth when he was still sane, before the fall of his house. Perhaps if you find the journal's missing pages, you will gain more insight into what befell the House of Plagues.> 
Complete 3 World Quests in Bastion.	Aiding Bastion	In our own golden hills, evil abounds. We will not allow it to take root and fester! Raise your voice, Maw Walker, and shout to the foes of Bastion! We are coming for them! With haste, now, seek out those in need of your might. Bring the sharpened blade of faith to bear against doubt and uncertainty. Crush despair with a gilded fist, and let it know the vengeance of the Archon! For Bastion! 
Extinguish 30 Volatile Embersparks.	The Dreadful Blend	Gravedust and Stipple Weed is a dreadful flavor combination, and Tubbins made a very large batch of tea with those ingredients. It was so horrid that I tossed the entire pot of tea on the fire. It turns out to be very wet, and an excellent extinguisher of flames! Tubbins will haul the entire batch with you. Put it to good use, by tossing it on the Volatile Embersparks around Zovaal's Cauldron. 
Bring Elios 1 Ripe Purian fruit.	Fruit of the Gods	You like sweet fruit? Stewards grow juiciest Purian. It special fruit! You find it many places in Bastion. It used for many things. Eat for nourishment. Give to bells for blessings. Give to stewards for treasure. You find, I show you how! 
Kill mutated devourers in the Resonant Peaks.	Pop Goes the Devourer!	Once... they had purpose. Made for balance. But now... shifted, altered. Disharmonious. They rend the pattern. It cannot continue. Elimination is the only recourse. 
Destroy 3 Anima Collectors in the Terrace of Inner Grace.	Distorted by the Maw	Lysonia's forces are rerouting the anima collectors to spew Maw energy across the temple. They hamper our forces while strengthening their own. The collectors have been tainted. Take Compassion and destroy them to halt Lysonia's boon. 
Listen to the plan.	Voices of the Eternal	<Bolvar peers at the grand figures before him, at the numberless gateways stretching out into the ether.>This chamber is... truly wondrous. Yet there is no time to be awestruck. The Honored Voice must begin this meeting at once. 
Search for Watcher Emil in the Catacombs of Regret.	Watcher Emil	Watcher Emil is my trusted overseer of the catacombs. Before I was thrown into the Maw, half of the mirror was entrusted to him. I had him stationed at the Catacombs of Regret. But I do not know where in the sprawl he is. There is a guard station near the entrance to the catacombs. Start the search there. There is an officer who can help us, I--I can't remember who. That is, provided they survived this whole mess. You must find Emil at once. We may not have much time.
