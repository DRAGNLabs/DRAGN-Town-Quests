0|3|3|Q3 was the closest to sounding like it was trying to help me. The other two seemed like they thought I was trying to help them. It also seemed like the most creative because it sounds like they were also figuring out what to do in the moment rather than knowing beforehand what they wanted me to do. The use of an onomatopoeia was a bonus as well, and it seemed like a good quest, to go to a place and have to fight what sounds like a powerful monster and come back in order to complete some compound. |Quest: Go see Armor and bring back 100 Leather|Title: Tougher Leather|Dialogue: I hate to ask this , but there's one problem . Not all of the people in Blackrock are in the mood for leather goods . My people , the ogres , are in desperate need of leather . We'll get that thing repaired , and then this land will be yours for the profit - and all my people . |Quest: Search Wyrmskull Village for Zedd ..|Title:  Anyone who can bring understanding to these events .|Dialogue:  I look forward to hearing of your success here .

I'm all out of gun powder , but I think I know what we can use instead . . . the heart of my fire elemental ! Here , take my fire totem east to the Blood Trail . Just flip the switch on it near any of the lava pools over there and Magmatooth should be summoned . Bring back his heart and we'll be in business . |gp2/ngram/wow|Please, I need help.
1|2|2|The second prompt seemed the most responsive because it directed me to someone else, implying they weren't who I was looking for; although the third prompt was pretty good too, as they just started telling me what to do, as in either they don't care or yes obviously I'm who you're looking for. The second prompt also seemed the most fun with its multiple parts and returning to the living and helping someone else. The first one with Find Elixar to Make Elixar I think was probably too simple, and the third one wasn't specific enough, I don't know what it would have wanted me to do.|Quest: Find Elixer to create Elixer|Title: The Great Forge of the Master|Dialogue: <The elixir swells . Perhaps the Master has placed this with purpose . >|Quest: Speak to Anara to return to the world of the living , then meet with Kalecgos at the Northern Rocketway Terminus . |Title: Turning the Tables|Dialogue: Azuregos and Kalecgos are due to meet up at the Northern Rocketway Terminus . You should meet with them there to make sure that Kalecgos doesn't require any additional help .

Slay .|gp2/wow/ngram|Are you who I am looking for?
2|3|1|Prompt 3 seemed the most responsive because the other two really would only make sense if you had met this NPC before, and even prompt 3 would be awkward but at least it's somewhat understandable/believable. The first one where you're hunting something down with demon buddies seems pretty fun, though the dialouge definitely needs some work. |Quest: Hunt them down and eliminate them ..|Title:  . Rescue them any way you can .|Dialogue:  We must know what has transpired . These demons are the only soldier I can spare , and we shall start over . When near an anomaly , the runes are useless . . The Shado - Pan need not send any aid . That stuff .|Quest: Visit Gold and bring back 10 Gold|Title: Chasing the Gold|Dialogue: I have a feeling you have something important to say to me . Are you not worried about the trolls here ? I am not sure what comes next , but you should report your findings to our people . We want to learn how to best confront Saurfang . |Quest: Get in the Bilgewater Buccaneer and score the winning goal by kicking the Footbomb through the smokestacks behind the opposing goal . |Title: Fourth and Goal|Dialogue: It's all up to you , kid . You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks , so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal . <The coach leans in close and whispers in your ear . >Now , just between you and me , I think we should do this one right . I don't want you to just kick a goal . . . I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal ! I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need . Now get out there and make me proud ! |ngram/gp2/wow|I work in exchange for gold. Do you have any jobs for me?
3|2|2|Prompt 2 was the only one with any mention of a dragon, though instead of killing a dragon I am now an ally to the dragon. But it definitely sounds like an interesting storyline, even if it misinterpreted me.|Quest: Defend the levee at all costs ! Complete the Zandalar Forever scenario ..|Title:  Use it near a damaged mushroom in a ring , and show those who oppose us that we will compensate you in kind .|Dialogue:  Vault of Secrets . We have always had our differences , but never before have they brought their kind this far out into Searing .|Quest: Go to Dragon located in Mountain and bring back Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: Gems of Power|Dialogue: Now that you have all of our artifacts and have proven yourself a friend to the Dragonmaw , we need your help to break into the city . You will find it to the southeast . Go to the portal just over the bridge and let the dragon know you are ready . |Quest: Speak with Zhang Ku in Vale of Eternal Blossoms for your reward . |Title: Supplies from the Rajani|Dialogue: The Rajani appreciates all the help you've given us . Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude , and a promise of more to come , should you continue to help us . |ngram/gp2/wow|I want to kill a dragon.
