0|1|3|I felt that Q1 was the best reaction to my input because it directly referenced my offer to help. Prompt 3 was the most exciting/creative because it immediately thrust me into a nuanced affair that seemed more impactful on the world and placed me into contact with expectantly cool npcs, a more exciting prospect than what was essentially rounding up sheep in prompt 1|Quest: Leash and return 6 Windward Hatchlings to their nests . |Title: Empty Nests|Dialogue: When the attacks began , the young hatchlings scattered in terror . They are roaming around the island , lost and scared . If you want to help , take this rope and leash the lost little ones . Take them back to their nests .

1|2|2|Prompt 2 seemed the best responsive to my input because it offered me a quest that was better understood by me than the other prompts and seemed to act on my offer of a sword. The implication of the quest to me implied some combat of some sort, which seems the most fun to me.|Quest: Search the Bole I wish your tidings were better ..|Title:  My cousin , a healer , lives there - a scrollkeeper named Reshad .|Dialogue:  Song of Wind and Water Listen to storm , yes ? And if you can find something to lead us to the Rajani . Will you assist us in infiltrating Scalawag .

You get the chop , I'll make you a feast worthy of the tides . |Quest: |Title: Devouring Darkness|Dialogue:  |ngram/gp2/wow|I'm here to offer my sword in aid
2|3|1|Prompt 3 seems the most responsive to my input because it offered a request where I could return for some payment as opposed to prompt 1 which seemed to react to my equipment over my input and gave no promise of returning to the questgiver for payment. Prompt 1 however seems to promise a mystery of some sort, which could imply some puzzle-solving which is more enjoyable than a fetch quest.|Quest: Discover Archmage Modera's message by using the Glowing Resonate Crystal . |Title: An Unexpected Message|Dialogue: Ah , Felo'melorn .

Return this to me once you've completed such an incredible task . |wow/ngram/gp2|What can I do for some coin around here?
3|3|3|Prompt 3 seemed to imply that it is a continuation of a previous quest I had completed, and I had received word to return to the quest giver. This makes more sense than being summoned to chop some wood and prompt 2 was nonsensical. Thrusting me back into a mystery with Prompt 3 would be both fun and engaging as the prompt seems to promise a stealth quest|Quest: Visit Pickaxe and bring back 8 Wood|Title: The Woodpile|Dialogue: <An elderly tree rests on your belt . ><You find a single wooden leaf on its tip .
