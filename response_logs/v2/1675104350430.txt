0|2|1|I asked about food, and the second one talked about leather which was the closest to what I asked. The first one just seemed to be more in-depth, with specific locations and a cool objective, even though it had nothing to do with my prompt. The dialog for question 2 made no sense and felt like a weird dream lol.  |Quest: Gather 8 Twilight Armor Plates ..|Title:  Inform them they may open their portals there .|Dialogue:  Recently , such problems have become increasingly common .

1|1|1|Q1 was most responsive to my input, fire spells, because it talked about dragons and the island being destroyed, which has more to do with fire than swamps and sea monsters. I also think the first scenario was much more interesting mainly because of the understandability of the task, as the dialog was coherent and engaging. |Quest: Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at KTC Headquarters on Kezan . |Title: Give Sassy the News|Dialogue: I'd celebrate with you , George , but it feels like that dragon did a number on ol' Mount Kajaro . I . . . uh . . . I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving the island !

2|3|3|Prompt 3 was most responsive to my input "giant slayer" because it had to do with slaying some type of monster, which was a moose ancient spirit. The first one isn't comprehendible and the second one talks about chopping wood. Only the third one made enough sense to actually complete, and has a very engaging idea.|Quest: Attack by Air ! They have brains , too - they just don ' t think could exist outside their own plane ..|Title:  It ' s in a Name Name ?

3|2|3|Prompt 2 related more to warlocks because it involved some mystical elements, which were gems from a dragon. Prompt 3 was more interesting because it had to do with kidnapped babies or something like that, but overall each prompt didn't make any sense. |Quest: Mine has never felt heavier than it does at this very moment , yes ? It is done ..|Title:  This dark artifact is the key to unlocking the gate to scout out the size of my knuckle .|Dialogue:  As luck would have it , I knew not what it meant .
