0|3|2|Prompt #1s Title didn't quite make much sense, & the Dialogue didn't connect to the Quest it had. Maybe if it was an NPC that wasn't part of the main story the conversation the Dialogue would make sense (maybe). The Dialogue didn't really line up with that I said either.

Prompt #2s Dialogue seemed like I jumped in mid-conversation with someone. I put 'Whats up?' as a question to find out how the NPC was doing, or how I would with someone irl. I wasn't expecting to be thrown into that conversation. The Quest & Dialogue in this one did line up which was good!

Prompt #3 was the closest to what I would consider a normal response to my question. The Quest & Dialogue didn't line up, but it could work maybe. Also I'm confused on the Title for this one. Does it mean Pickaxe the item or Pickaxe the location? The Quest uses the word Pickaxe like a location so that's why I'm confused. 

After every sentence there is a <space> <.> <space> but that is a very minor thing tho. The only other thing I'd say is pls add a spell checker to this survey :)|Quest: Search all the nooks , crannies , and side - caves ..|Title:  We may be on the map might represent .|Dialogue:  These flimsy wooden walls are an embarrassment to farm alongside you or that Yoon shmuck .

When you're ready to face him , head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake . It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar .
