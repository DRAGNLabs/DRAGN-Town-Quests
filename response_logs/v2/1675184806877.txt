0|1|1|I felt that Q one was the most responsive, but that's not a high bar. The second two were talking about clothes and a pool party, which was completely unrelated. Prompt one had at least a feeling like it could be useful in the future to complete that task.  |Quest: Complete the Trial of Frost by gathering 20 Essence of Ice without getting hit by Frostburn . |Title: The Trial of Frost|Dialogue: You know , some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted . I always say though , I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning . To reach the Trial of Frost , touch the Frost crystal to open a portal . Once there , the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies . To counter the simple , the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress , as it were . If you want to be fancy , you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by . Neat , eh ? |Quest: Go to Mayor and bring back 1 Mayor|Title: Wear This|Dialogue: Okay , this one says you want to take it out in the pool ! And on your feet !

A page out of Deathwing ' s demise . Messenger to the .|wow/gp2/ngram|My son...was murdered. I'm seeking revenge
1|3|3|3 seemed more responsive, because even though it wasn't telling me how to get a bow, the quest after was hunting, and seemed to be related a bow through hunting. |Quest: Defend Ardenweald by completing Daily Quests and World Quests , and slaying rare creatures ..|Title:  If it works , the runed giants .|Dialogue:  Recent events have unleashed terrible horrors upon our sacred vale , but allies of the Frostwolves . Nemesis : Hunter - Hunted Our enemies surround us , and we can only hope that , thanks to your friend .|Quest: Visit Volcanos located in Volcanos |Title: Danger at Volcanos|Dialogue: Volcanos is a sacred place for the Zandalari .

Test your skills against the Nightbane worgen in Brightwood Grove . We'll see if you have what it takes to hunt these monsters . |ngram/gp2/wow|I need a new bow
2|1|1|None of the three prompts seemed related to my input at all. |Quest: Take the Mysterious Tome to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post . |Title: Decipher the Tome|Dialogue: This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret Alliance cipher . Althen , the historian in Spinebreaker Post , has studied the Unyielding for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book . |Quest:  Explore Leather and bring back Leather obtained from Wolf|Title: An Unfortunate Friend|Dialogue: With the help of the others , we managed to bring these wolves back to safety .

How to Become Forsworn The Forsworn have taken control of the Body Banks , .|wow/gp2/ngram|Is there a tavern nearby?
3|3|3|Again, None of the prompts seemed responsive to my input. Q2 didn't create anything at all. |Quest: Listen to Shokia's report . |Title: Scouting Report: Like Jinyu in a Barrel|Dialogue: With our leader turned to jade , our hozen guide disappeared , and a prisoner of war in tow , there was only one thing that Kiryn and I could do:March into our enemy's territory and deliver some vengeance .
