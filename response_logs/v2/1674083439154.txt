2|3|3|Again 3 felt like the most complete answer however 2 was a close second. 3 responded immediately with what we needed for a weapon which is was I was asking for. 2 seemed like it too was a fun prompt and task to do but not quite in line with my prompt|Quest: Gather 4 Ancient Dreyrgrot tablets from the ruins , please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them to the Executioner ' s Altar ..|Title:  I have honored her request for a rematch , but I ' ve learned though , that the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they would make excellent|Dialogue:  .|Quest: Visit Dragon located in Mountain and bring back Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: Gems of Power|Dialogue: I see them coming .

3|2|2|I went with 2 because it was a complete thought and prompt. 3 was very scattered and didnt make much sense while 1 wasn't a good answer to my question.
