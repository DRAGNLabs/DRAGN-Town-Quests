0|3|3|Prompt 3 was responsive to my input because it is the only one that had a definite opportunity to make money. I also think it is the most entertaining because who wouldn't want to help with poultry science by going to Dr. Oglethorp in Booty Bay? Prompt 2 was kind of incoherent, and Prompt 1 was not something I would expect from meeting an NPC for the first time (unless they were kinda insane).|Quest: Find Magic to create Magic|Title: My Purpose|Dialogue: It is well known that the Light wants to destroy these things , but the darkness is so strong here ! I know I am speaking a terrible tongue , but I am wise to think of an alternative . It is time you sought out the Legion and gave them a taste of your fury .

1|3|3|Prompts 1 and 2 were pretty incoherent. Prompt 1 didn't have complete sentences and prompt 2... well I'm not going to fight 1 axe to obtain 1 axe. None of the prompts really responded to my input, but the third one definitely sounds like a valid quest I could go on.|Quest: Help Anduin Wrynn find the Monkey King says he used a mask to cure old pandaren emperor , Shaohao , when he was too sad to lead his people ..|Title:  Kill 12 Kobold Diggers .|Dialogue:  The trolls , as you have the time , but Lar ' korwi , find a fresh kill .

Denathrius's machinations have left the venthyr poorly provisioned , and Prince Renathal will require all the souls he can muster . |ngram/gp2/wow
2|3|3|Prompt 1 was incoherent. Prompt 2 made no sense. Prompt 3 made the most sense and sounded like an actual quest. Still, none of them actually responded to my input.|Quest: Slay Sea Monster located in South Sea |Title: The Raging Tempest|Dialogue: <The giant statue turns to stare at you . >You see this to the very bottom of sea . Deep sea , deep sea . The land that we fought to take , the land we lost .

3|2|1|Prompt 2 sounds the most like an actual quest. I can even see how that quest could possibly maybe result from my input. But I would most like to do Prompt 2 so I can "mount an Argent Hippogryph , throw 8 Flaming Spears at the North Sanctum and kill him"|Quest: Attack Venomhide Ravasaurs for a chance to mount an Argent Hippogryph , throw 8 Flaming Spears at the North Sanctum and kill him ..|Title:  .

There is a nest just outside the entrance , on a rocky ledge above the cave . Be careful , George . The eggs are very delicate . |Quest: Vanquish Sword to obtain 8 Wood|Title: A Piece of the Puzzle|Dialogue: We're going to be going to find Zephyrium on this mountain , but when we did that , a piece fell off .
