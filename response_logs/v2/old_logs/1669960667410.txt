0|3|2|Prompt 3 felt like a more realistic answer to "Got anything to do?" "Get Armor" but said to get armor to create leather, which felt a bit backwards and a bit boring. Prompt 1 was hard to read.|Quest: Explore the spires and pass through The Dragon Wastes ..|Title:  To do so , it will do us no good .|Dialogue:  You will require my assistance if you hope to succeed .

1|1|2|Prompt 1 was the only one that responded to my specific request for a new sword, though the quest title was backwards (get sword to create wood, when it should be get wood to create sword). Prompt 2 had the most interesting quest title, though the dialogue was confusing, with graphics it could be made a quirky thing, but in text format is just confusing. Prompt 3 was the most coherent, but unrelated to my input and frankly boring.|Quest: Gather Sword to create Wood|Title: Weapons of the Wood|Dialogue: To the north , in the Marshlands , there is a man named Grimtotem who is the ""sword"" of his people .

I don't know how she plans to do it by herself , but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother , so I can't really object . Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines , you know ? |gp2/ngram/wow
2|1|1|Prompt 1 was the most coherent, and framed way that felt the most natural to my question (didn't use an as you know to answer a question of is there anything to do here like prompt 2). It also had a lot of cool sounding names. Prompt 3 was incoherent. Commas were randomly placed, and it read like a bunch of random phrases, not complete thoughts.|Quest: Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Warsong Battle Standard at Icemist Village and defend it against attackers . Return the Warsong Battle Standard when you are finished . |Title: The Might of the Horde|Dialogue: The taunka are now our brothers in arms . We must show our solidarity and retake Icemist Village .

3|2|3|Prompt 1 barely made sense in that you could make a better dagger out of a found dagger. Prompt 2 mentioned orcs, so it was the most responsive, but made no sense. I have no idea what "If anyone can help us, go to the fel orcs we're having." means. Prompt 3 was the best in that I could easily grasp what the mission was, and had a mildly interesting title.|Quest: Bring back Dagger to create Dagger|Title: Dagger|Dialogue: |Quest: Create a distraction in the camp of Maximillian of Northshire speaks to 2 Steam Furies ..|Title:  .
