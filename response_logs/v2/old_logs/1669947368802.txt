0|2|2|The first and third quest didn't make much sense(the first one was titled 'Gather Mayor to create Mayor'), but the third one seemed interesting. It was a bit abrupt ('Speaking of lakes' when I hadn't mentioned a lake) but it made sense and the task I was asked to do was clear.|Quest: Gather Mayor to create Mayor|Title: The New Mayor|Dialogue: I have learned much from my time in your chambers , Human . I now understand where this city's power comes from . A thousand years ago , the Shadow Council destroyed that temple . It left a void that now holds large proportions . I have been collecting powerful artifacts , including the one they would destroy if left unchecked . Search the temple grounds , I believe . Bring me an ambassador . I will give you my knowledge as to their purpose . Make no mistake , we are here to help the Shadow Council , Human . |Quest: Bring 8 Pristine Shimmerscale Eels to Seth in Shattrath . |Title: Rather Be Fishin'|Dialogue: Speaking of lakes , there's a lake with real good fishin' up to the northeast . I used to go up there with my friends , but my mom won't let me go anymore . She says it's too dangerous , but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders . Like spiders can do anything to you . . . My favorites were always the eels that live up there . If you're going to be up by the lake , would you think about bringing back some of the eels ? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em , you can bring 'em back no problem . |Quest: Gather 8 Sketh ' lon Wreckage to the north ..|Title:  That must be the new captain of the force down there will have some insight into this .|Dialogue:  I ' m no druid , but I do not doubt Senegos ' plan , then travel to the Throne of Elements , Player . I can hear Azeroth ' s pain . .|gp2/wow/ngram
1|3|3|The first two quests didn't make much sense, although it was entertaining to read. The second quest in particular was very disjointed:
"Title: higher up .
Quest: Attack their champions and eliminate them ..
Dialogue: You Scratch My Back . Witness the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Drill Rig construction project . I was not entirely convinced you were not one , the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the overseer ' s Apexis turret . This crystal contains a ."
They did not finish their sentence and I would have no idea what to do. The third quest was a lot more cohesive and actually seemed quite interesting. I could believe that one was actually written by a person and not an AI.|Quest: Slay Ted to obtain 1 Family|Title: Lovers of a Fish|Dialogue: My kind have never hunted . To hunt , one must become a vocation . But who are we to judge ? If you could somehow identify the ancestors of the people in the village over there , perhaps we might learn how to save them . Let's see if we can track down their hunting partners . |Quest: Attack their champions and eliminate them ..|Title:  higher up .|Dialogue:  You Scratch My Back . Witness the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Drill Rig construction project . I was not entirely convinced you were not one , the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the overseer ' s Apexis turret . This crystal contains a .|Quest: Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to collect 8 Twilight Tablet Fragments . |Title: The Twilight Mystery|Dialogue: A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here . If you were to venture there now , you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was . I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site , but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful . See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus . |gp2/ngram/wow
2|2|3|Quest 2 seemed to be most responsive to my input, it seemed to be about some sort of monster which is what my input asked for, but it was very disjointed and didn't actually make much sense(it still made more sense than Quest 1). Quest 3 seemed the most fun to do even though it didn't relate to my input.|Quest: Attack on the Tower Here ' s the proximity to the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith ' rix the Dark Master ..|Title:  However , if you get in trouble .|Dialogue:  If Prustaga has the local vrykul on her side , things may get . Paid in Lifeblood We have fulfilled Helya ' s kyrian followers . If .|Quest: Eliminate Arelind located in Arelind |Title: The Return of Arelind|Dialogue: As I said , the mogu are outvoting us . I need someone to take care of the rest . I know only one of these people , Arelind , who has the power to break the bond the mogu have had with their dark spirits . Follow our leader to his tent . There he will wait while you and I search for another way home . Then , if we work together , be sure to finish this as fast as possible so that we can pursue the Dark Lady . |Quest: Collect 10 Unrefined Power Crystals . |Title: Crystals of Unusual Power|Dialogue: Arcane crystals of this size and power are quite rare even on Draenor . It is no coincidence that the Draenei built Shattrath and Auchindoun so close to this mine . I am interested in learning more about these particular crystals and their arcane nature . Return to me with any unrefined power crystals that you may find and I will make sure that you are adequately compensated for your effort . |ngram/gp2/wow
3|1|1|Quest 1 seemed really cool even if it didn't relate to my input. Quest's 2 and 3 didn't make much sense. Quest 2 asked me to collect goblins protected by goblins to create gems, and quest 3 didn't make any sense at all.|Quest: Deliver the Unblemished Heart of the Guardian and the Gusty Essence of the Warden to Har'koa at Zim'Torga . |Title: The Gods Have Spoken|Dialogue: The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom . Travel north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart . Travel east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence . Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear . |Quest: Collect 100 Goblins located in Mountain which is protected by 94 Goblinss to create Gems|Title: My Friend at the Drowned|Dialogue: <You see a large , skeletal human head in the water for a moment before you realize something is wrong .
