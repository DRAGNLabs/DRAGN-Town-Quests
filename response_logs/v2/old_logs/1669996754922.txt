0|1|1|I didn’t really feel like any of the prompts were super responsive to my input. Prompt one was the most creative and could have been a valid response if there was some acknowledgement or greeting at the start. The other ones just didn’t feel like natural responses to a greeting. Prompt one was also the most exciting for a game because it had a logical plot line. |Quest: Take a Flayedwing Transporter to the Vault of Secrets|Title: To the Vault|Dialogue: Thanks to the Bonesmith's repairs of both conduits , anima should now be flowing to the vault . That gives us a chance to get inside--assuming we can reach it . Our Maldraxxi allies have wrangled transportation to get us to and from the vault . I suggest we make haste . If the Jailer's minions obtain the sigil of the Primus before we do , it won't just be Korthia that suffers . All the Shadowlands may be forfeit . Let's go , Maw Walker . Our forces will be awaiting us . |Quest: Attack on the Tower Here ' s your turn now ..|Title:  You are in luck .|Dialogue:  As you touch the vial , your mind is open to learning the deepest lessons the trials have to teach us , Return Gurf ' s Dignity to Gurf at Stillpine Hold , Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus ' Landing .|Quest: Bring back 10 Gold to create Gold|Title: The Gold|Dialogue: <Darn it ! Such uselessness . I can make no money out of it . You must earn some coin so I can continue with my forge . First , you will need to get some gold for me , so I can continue to refine my forge . The mines northwest of here contain plenty of gold , but the rate of production is just way too slow ! Go to the mine and help me out ! I swear I will pay you ! |wow/ngram/gp2
1|1|1|Once again none of the prompts were super responsive to my input. I felt like the sort of disoriented response from an NPC could be a natural response and a justification for not responding to a prompt. Question one also had the most clear gameplay goal of ‘defend’.|Quest: Hold off the Zan'thik while Rik'kal wakens . |Title: The Dissector Wakens|Dialogue: You are . . . not like the others . . . I hear the Klaxxi calling . . . <cough>I just need a moment . |Quest: Kill 4 Gold to obtain 10 Gold|Title: Priceless Gold|Dialogue: The Horde is no longer our enemy . With the fall of Garadar , we simply cannot claim the lost empire of Pandaria for our own . As much as I hate to spill the blood of fallen soldiers , it would seem to me that you are not truly our enemy . We cannot afford to lose our hold of territory now . I need of you . The remaining Horde has abandoned gold mines to pay their debts to the Iron Horde . The Horde won't stop until they're done with this . Take their gold to the mines and earn whatever gold you can . |Quest: Help me recover the stolen lager from Bloodfin Village ..|Title:  Piracy career - wise , this ' s a Matter of Strategy * * Eyes Only - - Commander Player * * The Iron Horde has been allowed to run rampant .|Dialogue:  Free Freewind Post Alas , it ' s him !
