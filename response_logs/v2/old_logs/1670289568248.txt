0|2|2|I felt the second prompt was most responsive to my input because it was clearest what the character needed and why it would help them.

1|3|2|The third prompt mentioned feeding a hatchling, which came the closest to being about taming a dragon. The second prompt was interesting because it suggested finding another character to fight with, and fighting a dragon for its gemstones seems cool.|Quest: |Title: LFGDungeons - Cataclysm - Dungeon Normal 1st|Dialogue:  |Quest: Fight Dragon located in Mountain to obtain Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: The Lost Gems|Dialogue: It appears that the power of the Sunfury may be in balance .

2|3|2|Prompt 3 was most responsive because it mentioned I'd get a pickaxe, which I guess could be used as a weapon.
Prompt 2 seems like a cool assassin mission, and hints at some sort of storyline involving the two targets.|Quest: Mine Disposal , the Goblin Way The paratroopers have mined the beach !

3|2|3|The second prompt mentioned a meal, which was somewhat responsive to me saying I needed supplies.
The third prompt seemed exciting because it suggested an upcoming battle, and I'd be curious to see what sort of strategy the meeting results in.|Quest: Attack their champions and eliminate them ourselves ..|Title:  Catching Abyssion will be extremely angry to have lost them so carelessly ? < The small seed is starting to sprout .|Dialogue:  < Grizzek leans in close to a plague wagon to unleash your engineer .
