1|3|2|None of the prompts really addressed what I said, but I think that is because they are set to give out quests and not give assistance as I asked. Though, the third prompt did direct me to a place for a reward which has some correlation to giving help. I think the second one was creative in names as well as a coherent story. |Quest: Mine has never felt heavier than it does at this very moment , yes ?

2|3|3|Prompt three offered a quest in which I could gain 100 leather. In a way, this is providing me an opportunity for a weapon, but I did ask if the NPC could craft me a weapon not give me supplies. The third prompt was also creative and had a good story behind it. |Quest: Speak with Lorewalker Cho at Onekeg in Kun-Lai Summit . |Title: Cho's Missive|Dialogue: One of those grummles came by and said that Lorewalker Cho sent for you .

3|3|3|None of the prompts were close to answering my questions. Prompt 3 was the most coherent and flowed the best. Prompt three created unique characters but the quest was related to helping the NPC not helping me find the princess which is what I asked about. |Quest: Gather 7 Flameflies ..|Title:  dying .|Dialogue:  Take your talbuk , mount up , and then bring the Head of Thunk , the Head of Gullok , and the Rusty Dagger to the correct patron . they pour out of their dormant state prematurely .
