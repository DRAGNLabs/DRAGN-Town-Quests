0|3|2|Prompt 3 was the only one that was related to armor (although I think the quest was about collecting armor to obtain something else)

Prompt 2 seemed the most fun because I would be actively looking for something and probably fighting people while doing it|Quest: Commander Schnottz wants you to persuade 6 Slacking Laborers to get to work . |Title: Make Yourself Useful|Dialogue: Gobbles vill be sorely missed , but zhe mission must not suffer . Perhaps zhere is somezhink you can do to redeem yourself . Take vone of zhe uniforms you recovered . Vhile vearink it , my vorkers vill not behave so . . . aggressively .

1|3|2|Prompt 3 was a perfect fit, I asked to fight goblins and it gave me a quest to do just that

Prompt 2 seemed more fun because I feel like panthers would be cooler to hunt than goblins|Quest: Speak with Lord Arthur Waycrest in Whitegrove Chapel . |Title: Running Late|Dialogue: I beg your pardon , but I am a little concerned at Lord Waycrest's tardiness . I'd hate to be a bother , but would you mind checking on him ? The ceremony awaits his presence . You can find him in the bride's room , at the top of the tower . |Quest: Hunt 10 Panthers ..|Title:  Closing In The Legerdemain Lounge isn ' t enough !

I am tired of waiting around for an ogre to be clever enough to pick our crops and run rampant through our forest . We are too busy fighting our way up mountain to even bother picking a fight . We simply steal more crops from the forest ! I will have you kill the goblins to keep more crops from dying out . |wow/ngram/gp2
2|3|3|Prompt 3 was the most fitting to me because it involved speaking to someone. Prompt 2 mentioned a king but the whole prompt made no sense, but it had some cool names and the quest seemed original. Also Prompt 1 wanted me to "dig up wood" lol

Prompt 3 also seemed like the coolest one because connecting leylines sounds super cool and really creative|Quest: Travel to Pickaxe and bring back 8 Wood|Title: Wood|Dialogue: Our supply routes of wood dwindle . They're running low on wood right now , Player . Will you help us and dig up wood ? |Quest: Craft the Herald ' s Footpads with Dactylis ..|Title:  King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem and ask Calder about the piece of fur that Gurf had " " lost " " in the Court of Bones .|Dialogue:  Retrieve Slaag ' s Standard and deliver it to Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade ' s Edge Mountains . He .|Quest: Activate all of the leyline feeds in Suramar , then speak with Valtrois . |Title: Giving It All We've Got|Dialogue: The arcan'dor is drawing incredible amounts of energy . Even with the leyline feed at full capacity , we may not have the power . Let us first ensure that all potential leyline conduits connecting to Shal'Aran are active . Then I can attempt to amplify the output and hopefully satisfy this insufferable plant . |gp2/ngram/wow
3|3|3|Prompt 3 definitely fits the best, I inputted that a princess was kidnapped by a dragon and it gave me a quest to kill the dragon. Its dialogue was a little weird though and it didn't mention a princess. Prompt 1 did mention rescuing someone, but no princess or dragon, so Prompt 3 fits best to me

Prompt 3 was also the most exciting to me because fighting a dragon as some sort of boss battle would be awesome|Quest: Locate Apprentice Odari at Dragon's Teeth Basin . |Title: The Lost Shaman|Dialogue: Pardon me , Mechanic . I am in need of your assistance . Our shaman , Farseer Ori , left the camp some days ago to investigate a nearby disturbance in the elements . He took his apprentice with him , a young initiate named Odari . Neither have returned . I am leading an expedition to find them and return them here safely . Nazjatar is full of dangers . The skills of an accomplished Mechanic like yourself could prove most useful . Will you help me return the lost shaman to safety ? |Quest: Explore Torghast Baine is safe , but our soldiers need a great champion to follow into battle ..|Title:  Priestess Hu ' rala Thank you , Mechanic ! More Obsidian Warbeads T ' chali has been waiting for a hunter to match their skills against .|Dialogue:  So Far , So Bad Everything you ' ve spotted the roc . We call them .|Quest: Kill Dragon located in Mountain to obtain Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: Mountain|Dialogue: Thank you for this favor , $p . While I appreciate it , I must ask that you return to the mountain at once . I cannot deal with the distraction for long . Please do not return until I am done with this task . Until then , you've done me a great service by sending word of my distress . |wow/ngram/gp2
