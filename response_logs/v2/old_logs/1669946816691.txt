0|2|3|I think Prompt 2 was responsive to my input, as it was the most logical response. It wasn't super related, but that's probably my fault for putting in a bit of a weird query. I think prompt 3 would be most exciting because it's got a lot more unknowns, and you can tell that there's a backstory there. Also, I'm kind of a mythology nerd, so finding sacred/magical fruit in order to solve a problem is just a fun allusion (not sure if that was intentional or not...).|Quest: Search Rageclaw Den for a clue as to their whereabouts in the southern portions of the Pale Roost , to the north and bring them to me ..|Title:  This spot is used up but now I have a feeling they ' re taken care of , let ' s remain professional .|Dialogue:  And now trolls of lesser tribes seem to think .|Quest: Slay Forest located in Arelind |Title: Aunt Fjord|Dialogue: They're pulling us back , and they're taking our children .

1|1|3|Prompt 1 was responsive to my input because it was directly related to my query, even if it wasn't one hundred percent applicable to the implied situation. However, prompt three was most exciting to me because it contained the most potential for a story (besides just a bunch of killing people like in prompt one) and prompt 2 was kind of incomprehensible.|Quest: Obtain 25 Shrunken Heads from Bloodscalp trolls at the Zuuldaia Ruins . |Title: Headhunting|Dialogue: We must find if Yenniku is dead .

2|3|3|I felt that both prompt 1 and prompt 3 were really responsive, but prompt three was just a little more so. They both accomplished what I asked and were on topic. Prompt 3 seemed the most exciting because who wouldn't want to be a sneaky spy with magic? Also, I have no clue what prompt 2 is talking about.|Quest: Purchase an Anima Supricifer from Ve'nari and recover 5 Molten Anima . |Title: A Grave Chance|Dialogue: First you'll need a vessel to house anima and a way to expel it .

3|2|1|I think prompt 2 was the most responsive, as it gave an avenue that seemed like it would eventually fulfill my spoken desire for treasure. Also, riddles are cool. Prompt 1 seemed the most exciting because it made the user seem important and gave off slight "chosen one" vibes and also seemed like the first step in a longer (and potentially more exciting) quest, and also because I'm the person who likes walking around talking to everyone in games instead of fighting things.|Quest: Eliminate Magic to obtain 1 Magic|Title: Ride High|Dialogue: There have been reports that you possess an unusual power for such an age .
