0|1|2|Q1 was the most responsive to my input because it was the most coherent of all the responses (made the most sense to read), and it contained a little bit of lore to contextualize the quest.
Q2 sounds like it's the most fun because the tasks I think it would involve--collecting artifacts and spying on an inner circle--sound like tons of fun.|Quest: Participate in the ritual of judgment . |Title: Ritual of Judgment|Dialogue: After all rituals of absolution are complete , each soul must face its final judgment in Revendreth . There are three potential verdicts:If proven unworthy , it is condemned to the Maw for eternity . If fully absolved of its sins , it is either elevated to a venthyr or returned to the Arbiter to be assigned its new destination . Our most sacred ritual , the judgment , determines this fate . One such ritual is happening now . I will disguise you and we will participate to ensure a just verdict . |Quest: Help them if you will ..|Title:  Do keep an eye open for artifacts and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle .|Dialogue:  at least we know that he can be made using the cooking profession . . I ' d rip his still - beating heart out of his trance . . Problem is , we must secure what supplies .|Quest: Get Elixer to create Elixer|Title: The Great Fall|Dialogue: The elixer has been a great boon to the Horde , but only if they are used wisely . If we wish to see the Fall , we must not allow it to fall . There is too much at stake . Should we fail , the Fall's destruction would be swift , the orcs would attack , and the Alliance would gain ground once more . |wow/ngram/gp2
1|3|3|The 3rd quest is the most straightforward response to my input.  Quest 2 is just three unrelated quests and doesn't make any sense.  Quest 1 feels a little off somehow.
The 3rd quest sounds like the most fun to do.  The objective is clear, unlike Quest 2's objective.  By comparison, quest 1 sounds boring.|Quest: Kill Fish located in Great Lake to obtain 1 Fishing Rod|Title: The Great Lake|Dialogue: Those monsters are fishing off our shores . Their numbers are growing . Go down there and kill those who are in charge . Your presence will make all the difference . |Quest: Defend yourself and Earthcaller Yevaa from Iso ' rath !

USE . . . THE ELEMENTAL'S POWERS . . . TO DESTROY . . . THE TWILIGHT DEVOTEES . . . AND . . . THEIR . . . FACELESS OVERSEERS . |gp2/ngram/wow
2|1|3|The 1st quest is the most responsive to my input because the other two quests make no sense to read.
On the other hand, the 3rd quest is the most creative as it references cool-sounding artifacts and items.
The second quest is missing both a quest objective and dialogue, so I have no clue what it's actually about.|Quest: Vanquish Volcanos located in Volcanos |Title: A Matter of Strength|Dialogue: Before we can proceed any further , if you are interested in following up on my latest findings , you should slay Volcanos . |Quest: |Title: An OOX of Your Own|Dialogue:  |Quest: Destroy 2 Training Bags ..|Title:  Oh , and take him captive .|Dialogue:  Near earth . Master the land . He is to bring back an Icetip Venom Sac from an Icetip Crawler . Their aquatic magic is unmistakable . Then put an end to it now ! Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of their eggs from the other side .|gp2/wow/ngram
3|2|2|The second quest feels like it is part of a larger campaign (an ongoing war) and therefore is of the greatest importance (compared to the other quests).  It sounds like it'd be more fun than quest 1, and quest 3 doesn't make much sense.|Quest:  Explore Forest located in Arelind |Title: Culling the Wolves|Dialogue: The wolves are a nuisance and a grave threat to the Fae . We hunt them in numbers , and they are vulnerable ! My scouts have spotted small paces in the marsh where their pack mounds could be made . You may be able to help , Mechanic . |Quest: Speak with High Overlord Saurfang . |Title: Warning Orgrimmar|Dialogue: We have slowed the Iron Horde down , but this war is far from over . . . I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde . The Warchief needs to know about what we have accomplished here today , and the threat we face in the future . It is probably best if you report to High Overlord Saurfang yourself , Mechanic . |Quest: Help me recover the stolen fireworks from their village , Player ? Without those tools , we have only to bind my chosen val ' kyr are guarding a terrible secret ..|Title:  Use Erunak ' s image appears before you .|Dialogue:  Gather 7 Amber - Filled Jars from the Amber Collectors on the Stinging Trail . . I ' m sure .|gp2/wow/ngram
