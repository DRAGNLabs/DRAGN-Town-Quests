0|3|3|The third quest interested me because I want to know what "gorm gris" is and how I can use it for my benefit. It also sounded the most intriguing. The second quest did not make much sense at all, and the first sounded interesting at first, but the dialogue made me uninterested because it sounded like all I was doing was drinking someone's "brew."|Quest: Find 100 Goblins located in Mountain which is protected by 96 Goblinss to create Gems|Title: Goblin Brews|Dialogue: Some goblins are more craft than others .

1|2|2|The second quest was the only one that actually seemed to involve any fighting. The other two seemed like side quests, or little quests that you have to get done in order to progress on to the big battles, which are always more fun then just collecting stuff. I like to have big, epic battles that once you complete, you are then rewarded with some cool loot.|Quest: Retrieve 6 Chromatic Rosids near Dimensional Falls . |Title: Look Who I Found ! |Dialogue: Behold this magnificent creature !

2|3|2|Quest 2 actually sounds really fun, with components of exploration, collection, and battle all in one. I have a purpose, but still have the freedom to roam and do it my own way, which sounds like a blast. Quest 3 is actually telling me what I would need to do in order to get some armor, which is what I assume "garment" refers to. Quest 1 didn't make a lot of sense, and made it sound like I should just wander until I find something else to do. Maybe that NPC had just gone crazy or something.|Quest: Explore ..|Title:  Once the area has been cleansed , fly to the tip of the small hill between the three ancients .|Dialogue:  .

3|3|1|The title for quest one was exciting, and for a second I thought it would actually be what I wanted. But, it doesn't mention fighting any giants. Maybe I will be surprised and end up fighting one will trying to recover the items, but I think some kind of hint that there would be danger would have made me more interested. The third prompt is the only one that seemed to suggest I would fight someone (the mayor), who could be a giant? Quest 2 also sounds kind of interesting because of the language used, but it didn't make much sense, so I couldn't tell what I would be getting myself into by accepting that quest.|Quest: Recover DeMeza's father's Sword , Clothing and Bones . |Title: Pirates , Sea Monsters , Robots|Dialogue: I finally found it !
