0|2|2|I didn't put much input in, just a hello in French. So, I would normally expect like a hello back or something friendly of the sort. The first option bypassed formal greetings and went straight to talking about a quest, but didn't even phrase it as a request. It sounded robotic. The second one sounded like the NPC had a stake in the quest, so the NPC could possibly have skipped formalities in order to request help quickly. The third just wasn't finished, but it responded in a personable way that suggests that the NPC knows the character. However, it talks as if I asked it for something, and I can't follow the dialogue when it jumps like that. So, the 2nd is the best fitting for my input. Again, the first was robotic and the third was incomplete, so they weren't as exciting as the second. The second sounded a little real and was complete, so it wins in creativity. |Quest: Kill Dragon located in Mountain to obtain Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: The King of the Dragon|Dialogue: The Dragonmaw are a bloodthirsty group who will do anything to acquire power and stave off defeat at all costs .
