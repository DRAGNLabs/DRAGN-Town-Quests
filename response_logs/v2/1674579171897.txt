0|1|2|I felt like I misunderstand what the goal is here. I asked the AI a question about how itâ€™s doing and instead it just gave me a quest. I assumed there would be a dialogue and that the NPC would guide the conversation into a natural quest giving state. |Quest: Search the room for a way to reverse the damage that has been done ..|Title:  And armies need orders .|Dialogue:  Slaughter any flayers you find . . Will you stand for us now that Saean is with them . Make your way to the first shrine . Morbent Fel should have breathed his last . An old pandaren we know as .|Quest: Get me Sea Monster located in South Sea which is protected by a Sea Monster |Title: The Island's Lost Treasure|Dialogue: If you look north of Izzard , you should find a sea monster named ""The Island's Lost Treasure" . He is old and worn out , but with enough love and dedication we might come up with an idea . Perhaps I can find him in Southsea ? |Quest: Take the Heart of the Forest to Hamuul Runetotem at the Grove of Aessina in Mount Hyjal . |Title: Aessina's Miracle|Dialogue: <The finger-like branches of one of Nordu's burning limbs part , revealing an untouched , glimmering seed . >This is the Heart of the Forest . The seed of life . Take this to your Arch Druid at Aessina's Grove - Hamuul Runetotem will know how to invoke its power . I promise you , the wilderness spirit will be silent no longer . New life will bloom from the ashes of old . Thank you , Human . My time is done . |ngram/gp2/wow|Hello, how are you?
