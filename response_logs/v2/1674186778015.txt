0|1|3|I thought prompt 1 was responsive to my input because I asked if I could help, and the prompt made it seem like they did need my help. Prompt 2 also seemed like that, but it didn't make sense overall. Prompt 3 was very interesting because of the riddle and the idea of waking up this mysterious monkey, which is why I answered it for Q2, but didn't think it worked for Q1.|Quest: Obtain Bear located in Forest which is protected by a Bear |Title: Bear's Pride|Dialogue: For the time being we believe you are capable , but bear pride is a different animal than we have witnessed in our lifetime .

1|2|3|None of the prompts really fit my input very well, but I think 2 was the best because it was the closest to at least building a sword. The other two were unrelated to making or finding a sword.
I chose prompt 3 as most exciting because it did seem exciting to challenge many people to gain strength and experience as a warrior. It seemed like a good way for the character to grow.|Quest: Build - A - Bomination We need to steal these nests for her pranks over ten times already !

2|3|3|I chose prompt 3 for both because it actually talked about magic when I said I wanted to learn magic in my input. The other two didn't mention magic, and seemed random. Also, prompt 2 made no sense and didn't have any dialogue. The first prompt was somewhat interesting, but also confusing. I chose prompt 3 for excitement because the backstory was interesting and the quest seemed exciting as well.|Quest: Speak with Artificer Shela'na , Thelbus Wimblenod and High Priestess Ishanah . |Title: A Moment of Respite|Dialogue: For all we have seen , we must remember not to dwell on the past , but to look forward and prepare for what is to come .

3|3|1|I didn't feel like any of the prompts were responsive to my prompt because I mentioned a dragon, and none of the prompts did. Prompt 3 didn't make a lot of sense and had a lot of grammar errors, but it seemed to maybe talk about a dragon, so I picked that one.
I thought prompt 1 was very interesting because it had certain steps to the quest and it had a good story with pretty deep emotion to make it more exciting.|Quest: To begin your understanding of the Mok'Nathal , slay Vekh , leader of the Vekh'nir arakkoa . Then , return to Leoroxx at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains . |Title: Understanding the Mok'Nathal|Dialogue: <Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul . >You come to the Mok'Nathal , but you do not understand us .
