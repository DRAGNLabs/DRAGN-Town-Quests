0|2|2|I felt prompt 2 was most responsive to my input and would be most exciting because it was very specific. It also gave me something exciting to do, like defending a fortress, instead of just collecting wood to make a sword, which doesn’t make much sense to me anyways.|Quest: Help us make quick work of them ..|Title:  Although the plains are frozen , there are others with her .|Dialogue:  Bold .

2|3|3|Prompt three best responded to my input, because it gave me a quest. Prompt one gave me gratitude, and Prompt 2 was far less coherent than prompt three. |Quest: Speak with Priestess Thaalia at Fort Livingston in Northern Stranglethorn . |Title: Priestess Thaalia|Dialogue: Thank you , George . I know you didn't have to save my life . The return of Bloodlord Mandokir is ill news . He was killed inside Zul'Gurub several years ago , and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind .

I will pay you for what I have seen . But first , Mary must be brought to me . |wow/ngram/gp2|Give me a heroic mission
3|1|1|Prompt one was the closest to making sense according to my input. It gave me a way to get gold, but then it asked me to bring the gold back to die one speaking. So it didn’t respond exactly, but it was close.|Quest: Travel to Gold and bring back 10 Gold|Title: More Trouble|Dialogue: I am going to show you a great gift of gold , Player .
