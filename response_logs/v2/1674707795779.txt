0|2|3|Q2 was the most coherent, while Q3 sounded like the most fun.The first prompt used a lot of words that I would assume would be story related and thus interesting from a lore perspective, but it didn't really have a goal for the player to accomplish. Prompt two was a little off as my input was along the lines of "What seems to be the problem" but the dialouge makes it appear as if the player has already completed a quest and is being tasked with a new one- but it was the most detailed and made the most sense throughout. Q3 sounded like fun from a stealth perspective, but it also suffered from incoherence, though better than Q1|Quest: Craft the Herald ' s Footpads Sometimes , sheer force of will is not enough ..|Title:  But he made a grave mistake when he killed my brother .|Dialogue:  I find such use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium .

1|1|3|My input: "What happened here"
For Q1 it made complete and total sense as it referenced that something happened and then directed me towards another NPC who might know more- it could be used for suspense build up but beyond that it doesn't let the player do much beyond hunt down someone who might know. Q2 on the other hand is a bit incoherent, but it has some goals that can be accomplished, even if they are a bit difficult to understand due to the system|Quest: Speak to Barry in the Honeyback Hatchery . |Title: Leaving the Hive|Dialogue: <The enormous bee twitches its antennae toward you .

2|1|1|The first prompt was once again referencing previous help recieved, but that also made sense, not to mention the quest seemed interesting and unlocking that story sounds fun (Though from a player perspective if there is no fast travel it might be a bit annoying to travel all the way back to where you just found an item)|Quest: Use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at the battle site at the southeast end of the ruins . |Title: Visions of the Past: The Invasion of Vashj'ir|Dialogue: The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin .

3|1|1|The first two were pretty incoherent, and while Q3 had no dialogue, the quest was simple enough that it could be construed as just reading a quest board based off of my input. It also had the most interesting quest- helping some creature named Ikky hatch.|Quest: Explore Torghast for clues to locate your allies ..|Title:  .
