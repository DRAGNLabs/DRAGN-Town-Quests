0|3|3|Q1 was completely incoherent, the quest was not communicated and the title was irrelevant to everything else. The same can be said about Q2, though to a lesser extent; the dialogue, while obviously an accent or style choice, does not communicate what the NPC actually wants. The dialogue is also completely disconnected from the quest and title.|Quest: Help Lao - Chin ' s archers will light them up ..|Title:  Present it to an appropriate protoform forge and it may instantiate one of these manaforges .|Dialogue:  Find and catch the spirits of the nether drakes , which are seemingly tending the field of human seedlings , periodically jump to the nearest human and devour its head ! You can .|Quest: Get me Mayor to create Mayor|Title: The People's Mayor|Dialogue: Ahoy , mon . I can help ya out , too . Not havin' a choice with you , mon - seein' to da city is a problem I solve .

Why don't ya give it a try ? ! |Quest: Use the Vision of Time in the Siege of Orgrimmar . |Title: Hidden Threads|Dialogue: You have kept our mission a secret , and for that I thank you .

I believe it can now be used to see much further than before . I wish you to push it to its limits . Return to the Siege of Orgrimmar , and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find . |ngram/gp2/wow|How can I help you?
1|3|1|Prompt 3 was the most clearly communicated quest and is the most closely related to my input. It had to do with going to a place, which is good because my input was about finding my friend. Prompt 1 was the most standard game quest: gather materials for a crafting recipe. The dialogue and quest are a little muddled, but communicate enough to make sense. Gathering materials sounds more exciting than going to a place. Prompt 2 was complete nonsense.|Quest: Gather Dwarves to create Pickaxe|Title: Inventing Tools|Dialogue: We have some dwarven picks , but they aren't particularly adept at chopping wood . I think I've identified the problem . The pickaxe is made with dwarven wood that is used for tools in the surrounding stonelands . I don't know about you , but I fear I'm going to have to make use of the wood supplies for this task . You'll be able to find them around our bridge . |Quest: Attack their positions all along our line ..|Title:  What we know about them , but I suspect Witherbranch and some of my most trusted soldier , you are the only one who can see me , Player .|Dialogue:  Please have a pleasant millennium . Prepare yourselves . Darkcloud Grimtotem There ' s definitely something strange about that crystal and the portal .|Quest: |Title: Drain Schematics|Dialogue: The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake . If the schematics are correct , there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake . Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge . |gp2/ngram/wow|I want to find my friend
2|1|3|Prompt 1 was the most directly responsive to my input: I asked about a sword, and got a quest about a sword. The dialogue was not present, but gathering wood is easy enough to understand. Prompt 3 was by far the most exciting, hinting at a battle to come and giving a clear directive. Prompt 2 was unreadable.|Quest: Retrieve Sword to create Wood|Title: Gather Wood|Dialogue: |Quest: Craft the Sapphronetta Flivvers Action Figure at Pascal - K1N6 ' s database ..|Title:  Varian gave me a permanent limp I used to detect nathrezim when we served under Illidan .|Dialogue:  She should be given a promotion .

A small group of Sunreavers awaits you near the Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes . Report to Scout Captain Elsia for further instructions . |gp2/ngram/wow|Can you craft me a sword?
3|2|2|Even without dialogue, prompt 2 had a clear videogame style goal and the obvious implication of treasure. It also sounds like a boss fight, which is significantly more exciting than prompt 1, slaying pants. Prompt 1 does clearly communicate a goal, but leather is not an exciting treasure, and slaying 100 Pants does not sound all that interesting. Prompt 3 is garbled balderdash.|Quest: Slay Pants to obtain 100 Leather|Title: Grow in Size ! |Dialogue: The leather is plentiful around the village . As you look around , you notice that it's more plentiful than it appears . Would you like to grow a little bigger ? You'll find more leather than you realize around most of the village , which makes it a very valuable commodity for those who make the pilgrimage to the temple . Should you want to trade leather for more meat for your guests , I shall pay your respect . |Quest: Activate the braziers of Xal'vor and defeat Aiji the Accursed . |Title: An Ancient Curse|Dialogue: <The harsh conditions of Nazmir have not been kind to the stone tablet . Most of the inscriptions have been worn away but you are able to make out a picture that shows a chest surrounded by glyphs . Above the chest you noticed what appears to be a large floating skull . Below the images you find a single word ""Aiji"" . The ruins ahead seem foreboding , and you may want to bring some friends to help you . With their help , perhaps you can find the secret of this ""Aiji"" and its treasure within . > |Quest: Mine Disposal , the Goblin Way The paratroopers have mined the beach ! The Warchief should be arriving any time now ..|Title:  He was as terrible as Ragnaros himself ! Prepare yourself , friend .|Dialogue:  and not that of a traditional ascended , it is time to strike is now , Player , I have to believe you ' ll find .|gp2/wow/ngram|I want to look for treasure
