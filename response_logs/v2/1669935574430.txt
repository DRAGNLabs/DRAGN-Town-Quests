0|1|1|I was looking for rumors. "Gold somewhere in the South" and "the people...will tell you" are both rumor related. The third prompt sounds like basic item gathering. The second prompt makes little sense, but from the Quest field it sounds like something you do for an NPC you're already working with as part of a larger quest.|Quest: Defeat 2 Gold to obtain 10 Gold|Title: Gilded|Dialogue: With every passing day , our forces dwindle . If we are to keep our fight going , we will need to capitalize on every opportunity we find . To do that , we will need gold . I have no doubt that the people of Vale of Eternal Blossoms will tell you outright if there's any left ! If you will fight alongside the naga on your way to securing our base , there's gold to be found somewhere in the swamp to the south . Help me get my gold and I will show you the way to securing Vale . Glory ! |Quest: Defend me as I complete the ritual ..|Title:  Shatter their shells to discover the purpose of Revendreth , Temel has been charged with scouring the ruins in the mountains , outside of Valiance Keep .|Dialogue:  The local lieutenant seems to be little choice as their attacks on travelers through the area have become more aggressive . .

1|2|2|Prompt 2, because of the key and headmistress, seems most related to obtaining power. Also, the other two prompts are fairly nonsensical. |Quest: Mine Disposal , the Goblin Way The paratroopers have mined the beach ! The Warchief has instructed me to dispatch you to Silvermoon ..|Title:  If the cauterizing effect of the Falls know when you ' ve got everything we need .|Dialogue:  Atop the island you will find a flower called the ruby lilac .

Please , find me at the top of the stairs , and the two of us will begin our pantomime over my father's grave . If we make any progress here , our daughter will become aware of her mistake . |ngram/wow/gp2
2|2|2|None of these respond especially well to my input. I was looking for personal favors that the NPC needed, like a rat problem, or they are worried about their farm. Prompt 2 sounds the most exiting because ancient relics, offerings, and destruction. |Quest: Bring back 100 Goblins located in Mountain which is protected by 33 Goblinss to create Gems|Title: Draenei Power|Dialogue: <Edenheart's soldiers are all wearing goblins on their back . You have no idea how deep the hatred of these ""goblins"" is ! But if we want them to have more Goblins , we have to destroy them first . To that end , I've crafted a device called the Vicious Grasp that we will need to put down their offensive . If your goblin friend works for me to make him one , and is willing to aid in the destruction of the fortress here , I will reward you handsomely . |Quest: Stop the Darkscale Priestesses from offering the Horn of the Ancients to Azshara above Nazj'vel . |Title: The Offering to Azshara|Dialogue: The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel .

A Visit to the Curator The leader of these raids , but until then , Player . Travel through an Invasion Point on Argus and show the Legion that there is a way .|gp2/wow/ngram
3|3|1|Prompt 3 sound the most mercantile, and I was looking for official work. Prompt 1 sounds the most exiting, there's some search and find, some mystery, some ill omen. The second prompt doesn't say enough to be very interesting. |Quest: Find Dark Ranger Velonara in Tirisfal Glades . |Title: The Dark Ranger's Pupil|Dialogue: Thank the abyss you're here , fellow hunter ! I'm concerned about Dark Ranger Velonara , who frequents the Trueshot Lodge . Velonara is a good friend , and I fear she is in peril . She's been training an apprentice dark ranger , a lad named Prelus . Newly raised , she said . At any rate , Prelus ran off after receiving a letter from his brother , and now Velonara has gone to Tirisfal Glades to find him . I have a bad feeling about all this . Would you be willing to check on her safety ? |Quest: Destroy 10 Sha - Infested Yaungol ..|Title:  Defeat Jakra ' zet .|Dialogue:  Tell him his father fought until the end .
