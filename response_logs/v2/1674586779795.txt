0|3|1|I felt that Q3 was more responsive to my input because I put "How can I help you?" and he answered with a task. Also, after he stated the task (Collect 10 Creature Carcesses) he asks for another favor, and that just goes along with me asking how I can help, therefore I am offering favors. 
Q2 was more exciting because it was more detailed and I knew what was happening, what I need to do, and why. Q2 was cool a town was attacked but it was kind of general; so I don't know what is happening and it didn't really interest me. |Quest: Speak with the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer . |Title: Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Hammer|Dialogue: Mechanic , I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them , but you must get to Agmar's Hammer with all due haste !

1|3|1|Q1 and Q2 don't really make sense with my input, so at least Q3 didn't say anything, they just ignored me which makes more sense than the other questions. Q1 was more exciting because I could assume why I was given the task to burn Shadra, it's probably evil. This plot also reminds me of The Lord of the Rings, and that's exciting. Q2 was cool but I don't know why I would collect these fine materials, so it's uninteresting.|Quest: Kill Qiaga the Keeper and collect the Shell of Shadra . |Title: The Shell of Shadra|Dialogue: The final piece is all we need to burn Shadra out for good .

2|1|3|Q1 kind of answers my input by describing how to build a sword from wood, and I asked "what is my weapon".

3|2|3|Q2 talks about a beast and I imagine that is something I need to kill, so that matches with my input.
