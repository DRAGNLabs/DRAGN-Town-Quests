0|1|1|I felt the first prompt and the third prompt both made logical and grammatical sense, whereas the second prompt didn't really make much sense (there were a lot of unrelated words and unfinished ideas). Out of the first and third, the first responded better to my prompt (how can I help you?) because it gave me a specific task to do. The third one, though it made sense, didn't really give me a specific quest to go on, and while it referenced finding answers to something, it didn't specify exactly what we were finding answers about.|Quest: Bring back Arelind located in Arelind |Title: Arelind|Dialogue: As you have seen earlier , our village is surrounded by the mountains . As soon as the battle began , I saw Arelind run into town in great terror .

Arelind has no family on this island and she has made the most of this moment . Please , Player , save her .

None have reached Brennadam , but if there are any posted here we may be able to find some answers . |gp2/ngram/wow
1|1|2|Prompt 1 responded best to my input (I want to kill a dragon) because it did actually talk about a dragon, while the other two did not. However, it did not give me instructions to kill a dragon, rather to collect amber with dragon gem inside in order to decipher a message. I feel that the second prompt would be the most fun because it would involve seeking out harbringers and destroying them.|Quest: Eliminate Dragon located in Mountain to obtain Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: The Mysterious Dragon|Dialogue: Before they set sail for Dragonmaw Rampart we found a large boulder on the northwest face of the mountain . We think it might be where their leader hid the Emerald Dragonscale . If you can recover enough amber containing some kind of dragon gem we might be able to decipher this message .

2|2|2|The third prompt did not make very much grammatical sense, and was difficult to understand. The first and second both made much more sense, but I feel like the second responded best to my prompt (how can I help you?) as it gave me something specific to go do. The first prompt was well written, but it didn't really give me a specific task, and the ideas were a bit disconnected.|Quest: Collect 500 Gems which is protected by a Dragon to create Gems|Title: Vendors Help Us|Dialogue: Before we break off from the main quest , we may need your help in more ways . The gems gathered are only one part of what is needed to build one of my projects , but their power is enough to allow us to complete our work . This is a ritual designed specifically for use by Vindicator's Forge , Player . The purpose of this call is twofold: First , to gain information concerning the dragon race from each of their artifacts and second , to empower them if we find ourselves in danger of being overwhelmed by the enemy ! |Quest: Hierophant Cenius at the D .

Well , time to put that theory to the test . There ' s .|gp2/wow/ngram
3|1|1|The second prompt was grammatically difficult to understand, and the ideas in the title, quest, and dialogue were not connected. The third was very well written with lots of poetic, dramatic speech (and I got a specific task), but the ideas contained were a bit difficult to draw lines between. The first was the best. The ideas were very consistent throughout, and it gave me a specific task to do. However, none of the prompts really addressed my input (can you craft me a sword?).

I'm honestly super impressed with what you guys have done. Very cool research!! :)|Quest: Find Initiate Goldmine at the Quartzite Basin in Deepholm . |Title: Where's Goldmine ? |Dialogue: My goblin initiate has been gone for quite some time .
