0|3|3|Honestly none of the prompts answered my question very well.

2|3|2|Honestly none of them answered my prompt well but the third one was the list bad bc I felt it gave me incentive to stay in the area I was currently in. I thought the second option sounded the most fun bc of the details ij the discription. |Quest: Kill Gorgonite . |Title: Rock Bottom|Dialogue: I've one more favor to ask , fleshling .

Don't worry about the cost , it'll all be covered in this potion . |wow/ngram/gp2|Give me directions to home
3|3|2|I thought these responses were all good because I gave a very open ended question but the third option was the best because I felt the discription was the most specific.
