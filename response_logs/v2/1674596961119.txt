0|2|3|Q1 didn't have anything to do, or any diologue, so that was not relevant at all. Q2 seemed really interesting, something about finding gold in the water when it glints in the sun.

3|1|2|Q2 definitely made the most sense. The other two were pretty confusing. None of them really helped me with finding a better weapon, except that Q1 would help me find gold, which I assume would help me get a better weapon later on. |Quest: Bring back 10 Gold to create Gold|Title: A Piece of the Action|Dialogue: I know it seems a bit of a stretch to say Gold is gold , but what do you know ?
