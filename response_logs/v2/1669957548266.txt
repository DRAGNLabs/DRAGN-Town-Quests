0|3|1|None of these prompts related to my initial input whatsoever, but with some tweaking I can imagine how response three might relate to the dangerous endeavors of my Stormcloak Legion. Response One feels so quirky and funny, I can totally see an indie game having a scallion side quest haha|Quest: Plant a Scallion in Sunsong Ranch . You can purchase seeds from Merchant Greenfield in the Halfhill Market . |Title: Why Not Scallions ? |Dialogue: I heard Haohan mentioning that he was going to plant scallions today .

1|3|1|I just wanted an axe upgrade, not grave foretellings of the Hammer of Damnation! I chose prompt three because it mentions an axe at least, where the other responses fail to pick up on that. I quite liked the complexity and suggestion of a drawn out question that the first response gave|Quest: Collect Emerald Shards in the Dreamway . |Title: Shards of Emerald|Dialogue: Kalecgos tells me that you seek the power of the dragonflights in its most essential form . There may be something here that can help you . Fragments of our latent power have coalesced here in the Dream . They are scattered about the Dreamway , where my kin have fallen . Within the Dream , you should be able to wield those fragments in their raw state . |Quest: Mine has never felt heavier than it does at this very moment ..|Title:  The drogbar are using worms to burrow their way to safety .|Dialogue:  You should seek her out . he always grew leeks , and I fear you ' ll have instructions for you when you arrive .

All due respect to all the great warriors of this land , if I'm reading your notes correctly , the Hammer of Damnation still looms as a potential threat . If the undead continue to march on Orgrimmar unchecked this end will be ours within minutes . Your allies at Stonebreaker Hold will send word in the morning . All that remains is that you have a good fight . |wow/ngram/gp2
2|1|2|Question one mentioned gold, bet I could get some rations with gold (it was the simplest response to a simple question, but it still didn't quite match up). Two was soo complex, I loved it!|Quest: Gather this information and then return to Lauranna Thar ' well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh ..|Title:  Commander Skyshadow has tasked you with the destruction of worlds and the corruption of this land , Player .|Dialogue:  The leader of the Sha ' tari Base Camp We will not take any chances with one so .

Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var . It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy . I'm certain that Kanthin , fool that he is , has tried to compel Glacius to serve him . My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro , ' if that terminology has any meaning for you . |Quest: Go to Gold and bring back 10 Gold|Title: Collect 10 Gold|Dialogue: You've earned a spot on the team , Mechanic !

3|2|2|Something bad happened on the third response, I'd look at that in particular. It's almost entirely empty. The title and quest of the second response were perfect, but the body of the quest wasn't related at all. It's the most interesting anyway because the idea of an NPC being able to read the character's thoughts and act based on that is a cool idea. Might steal that for future games of my own|Quest: Create Your Own Strength For something that has been passed down in my family over the generations ..|Title:  In hopes that the enemy gathers outside the Empress ' s genemancers play with dangerous toys .|Dialogue:  I ' ve had sightings of yaungol in the Sumprushes .
