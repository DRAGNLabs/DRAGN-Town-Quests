0|1|1|So because I used a bit of slang in asking for the local rundown, the second and third responses weren't really applicable to what I wanted to ask.

Q1 represents the most stereotypical dialogue but it's also the most functional.  What I mean by that is say in a game you walk up to an NPC.  You press the interact button, but instead of answering your question or whatever they just give you a quest instead.

Q11 also in part because it's coherent raises a few plot threads even if I don't think it did the best job of it.|Quest: Journey to Meat and bring back 1 Meat|Title: Mildly Executing|Dialogue: I need you to bring me 4 large portions of beef meat from the various beasts within the Ruins of Shattrath . I'll provide you a small bounty so that we can start construction on my magnificent new arena ! |Quest: |Title: Direhoof's Hide|Dialogue:  |Quest: Create Your Own Strength For something that has been done ..|Title:  Is it possible these would be able to sleep at night .|Dialogue:  FLAG - Rikktik ' s Tick Remover Kill 12 Krik ' thik attackers at Niuzao Temple . . Go northeast , to the river , to the east . We will take them anywhere near you . Oh .|gp2/wow/ngram|Where can I get the local rundown?
1|2|2|Q2 is like hey I just got back from this other quest.  That sort of interaction I feel is what worked well with my prompt.

As for what felt the most exciting I felt that Q2 had the most potential out of the bunch.  Although it's possible that if handled badly it would be a really boring quest.

You bring back this book with mythical properties.  And it sounds like this group your working with wants to decode it and you're playing a major role here.  So as long as it doesn't turn into a series of boring fetch quests it sounds quite fun!|Quest: Explore the Chamber of Heart in Silithus ..|Title:  You won ' t do anything to help them , with your help , the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful place at my right paw .|Dialogue:  First , Slavemaster Ok ' mok by using the Challenge Gong in Stonemaul Arena . blueprints .

2|3|1|So my answer to Q1 is prompt 3 because it actually relates to this idea of crafting an item.  My prompt was that I have these dragon bones that I wish to make something out of.  The idea is hey go see X and work with like some master smith.  

Q2:  The idea of you working and holding an orb that corrupts spirits that you then fight is really interesting.  Gathering 100 leather so you can talk to someone to get armor is boring.  Well in part because it's resource collection.  Which isn't bad, but you're asking for exciting & creative.  
 |Quest: Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard and bring them to Custodian Dieworth . |Title: A Lingering Suspicion|Dialogue: The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before . It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture . As you sense spirits moving closer to the building , the orb glows with a greater intensity , which fades as the spirits leave . There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts . How it works remains a mystery . Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations . |Quest: Craft the Herald ' s Footpads to Dactylis ..|Title:  If we also manage to find the person you seek , it must mean Bazkoji is dead .|Dialogue:  I ' ll loan you one of those Twilight ' s Hammer captured .

They know , that the best quality hides are crafted from the finest leather . Their work can rival anything else in the Empire . If you could bring just such a leather kit back to them , it could save many lives . |wow/ngram/gp2|I want to craft armor out of dragon bones!
3|2|2|For question 1.  My prompt was I want to mary the princess.  In hindsight I should have put marry, but eh?  Response 3 does mention a temple of sorts, but prompt 2 deals with human interaction.

Question 2:  It might be because of the A.I generation, but in order to save Mary we have to kill Mary or something.  And that sounds the most interesting.  

Although prompt 3 is a close second.|Quest: Help Naralex seal the Nightmare Scar ..|Title:  To the far east , in the center of Abyssion ' s not working .|Dialogue:  They should be near the field if you need it . and if you find Cutter before I do .
