0|1|1|My input was based around asking a bartender about local gossip, and I feel like the first prompt was most responsive to that. The second prompt was almost incomprehensible, and the third prompt--while better than the second--felt more like a carpenter or smith pleading for help instead of a bartender giving me gossip. The tone of voice and setting of the first prompt was much more like a bartender giving local gossip.

I also felt like the first prompt was the most creative and exciting. It referenced several characters, a tangible conflict, and pointed me to a specific location. The names were also very creative--they felt like something straight out of Skyrim. Again, I wouldn't be excited about the second prompt because it's almost incomprehensible, and the third one was too generic and frankly didn't make too much sense.|Quest: Speak with The Bone Witch within the cave at Njorndar Village . |Title: The Bone Witch|Dialogue: You remember Lady Nightswood , don't you ? She certainly remembers you . She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion .

The bear must be the key to saving the town ! A visit to a bear would be so much more than just a simple tanning kit ! Please head into the woods to the west and kill a bear , bring back leather obtained from one of the bears , and I'll give you an extra trip . |wow/ngram/gp2
1|2|3|I think that the second prompt was most responsive to my input because it feels the most, out of the three, like something a king would say to me. It's both grandiose in scope and the NPC feels like they could be a king in the second prompt more than the other two, which feel like the NPC is a villager or priest.

The third prompt, however, was the most creative to me. It felt the most like it belongs in a game, and that's in part because of the detail. The NPC lays out the quest well and it feels less open-ended than the other two.|Quest: Explore ..|Title:  Take this disguise and enter Eclipse Point .|Dialogue:  I understand its screams now . In truth , we don ' t do our work ! Our grove has been completely engulfed by sha , and they seem to be amassing near the grove . Take this enchanted torch and return to me .

We can perform the rite for you . . . in time . First , I require aid . The seeds fall from our great mother-tree . It is our responsibility to collect them , even in dangerous times like these . Escort my chanters to the motherseeds , that they may bring them back to the collection pit . |ngram/gp2/wow
2|2|2|None of the prompts really gave me a bounty in response to my input (P1 and P3 were crafting quests and I don't know if I really understand what P2 is asking), however I think the second prompt fits the best--even though it mixed up the title, quest, and dialogue. It's asking me to go fetch a weapon (I guess?), which would make it the most bounty-like compared to the two crafting quests.

Regardless of its clunky and mixed-up text, I think the second prompt would be the most fun. It seems more adventurous than two crafting quests, however the third prompt was a close runner-up because of its grammatical correctness, polish, and potential for leading into another, larger quest.|Quest: Collect Pants to create Leather|Title: Forged for the Night|Dialogue: Look , if you want something , we got something . This is leather . No . . . it ain't gonna fly just yet , but then again , if it does , no one's going to know . Let's make some .

It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an ogre . I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control . . . but it's easier to one-up these fools . Tell Deez we've got one more order for him . I need a block of ice . |gp2/ngram/wow
3|3|1|Prompt 3 definitely responded to my input the best. I asked for a better weapon, and this quest talked about me finding a sword. However, it doesn't seem like the sword was for me to take and/or use, but more so as an intermediary for the quest.

Prompt 1 felt the most creative and exciting to me by far. It seems like a main quest that would progress through the game as it talks about giving the protagonist the upper hand in a battle against a seemingly antagonistic entity, the Shadow Council. Much better prompt than the other two.|Quest: Spy on the Shadow Council . |Title: All is Revealed|Dialogue: Tell me when you're ready . We'll invoke the power of the ring to summon one of their 'eyes . ' Through it , we'll discover where the Shadow Council is located and what they're really up to . |Quest: Attack a Druid of the Flame ..|Title:  Destroy 4 Captured Cannons .|Dialogue:  I ' ve been through , it looks ancient .
