I’m going to rob them, and they just want to send me on quests… I’m going to rob them anyways.|Quest: Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to bring him 4 Sporebat Eyes and 4 Fen Strider Tentacles . |Title: Gathering the Reagents|Dialogue: I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei , but would welcome an arakkoa . I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time . It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered . You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles . Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor . |Quest: Get Forest located in Arelind |Title: Arelind|Dialogue: It is a very strange sight to behold . Yet at the same time , it makes one feel comfortable . No doubt the mogu seek to aid the Kirin Tor through the Dark Portal . I don't have much time left for idle speculation though . I need someone to check in with Archivist Arelind and see how things are going . I do also need someone to gather intel on some of the fel-fled mogu out there . If you have the time , perhaps you should head up and find out what they really want . |Quest: Create Your Own Strength For something that has been trying to scare us off for days now with no end in sight ..|Title:  You have done a great deal of hope , hitting us with depression and despair .|Dialogue:  The Hunt Begins The Shadow Wardens have joined the elementals upon the battlefield . unimaginable .
