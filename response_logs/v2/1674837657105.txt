0|2|2|Q1 was responsive to my input because it actually related to the question and was a direct response, it allowed me to kill a large number of the same race. Q2 was also the most exciting/creative because it's the quest I would prefer to do in a real game, and again reacted to what I told the NPC.|Quest: Attack Venomhide Ravasaurs for a chance at another darkrune , take our things , leave big mess behind ..|Title:  Enter Tal ' farrak , bang de gong within , and face de hydra dey keep as a sacred duty .|Dialogue:  It ' ll be fine .

1|1|1|All of the responses were pretty awful. Question 1 was the most fluent and coherent, but it still didn't directly respond to my input. I said I wanted to capture and ravish the princess, so perhaps prompt 2 was supposed to be related to that with Valentine's Day but it meant absolutely no sense. Again, Prompt 1 had nothing to do with my prompt.|Quest: Cure 5 Frostwolf Gladiators . |Title: The Cure|Dialogue: Cowards ! A curse on these wretched meatbags !

3|1|1|Wow. Every prompt was terrible. None of them related to acquiring a sword or weapon in order to slay God. Prompt 1 just seems like a normal rpg quest, but again relates nothing to my input. Prompt 3 is complete gibberish, and shouldn't ever be used, and Prompt 2 doesn't really make sense. Would not recommend.|Quest: Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Thane Banahogg , the Deathblow .
