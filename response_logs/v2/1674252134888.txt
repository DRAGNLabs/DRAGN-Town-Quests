0|2|2|Honestly, my prompt might have been pretty vague, and I might try it again. Either way, the only dialogue that seemed to answer my question about any rumors appeared to be prompt 2. 

Prompt 1 was a mess. There was no context given, and the last sentence was incomplete.

Prompt 2 seemed like a natural flow of conversation in the first sentence, and if I had known this NPC beforehand, would actually be a very cohesive quest prompt.

Prompt 3 was second place, as it establishes that I already know this person, therefore reducing the need to answer the trivial question. Kinda like an ice-breaker. It was a little convoluted though, as there was an Arcane Initiate that was meeting with me on behalf of... the arcane initiate... It was not only an honor, but also... an honor... lot of duplication going on in this one.

The most creative one was also prompt 2. 

Prompt 1, while it could have been enticing, was impossible to understand without context. What was I supposed to do? Hunt a matriarch, collect statues? Why was I supposed to do it? It felt too forced.

Prompt 2 was interesting. Rather than interacting with unknown objects, I was tasked with learning more about these objects. While not perfect, it felt more like a natural questline than the other two.

Prompt 3 was, yet again, a little convoluted. There's a Twilight Hammer organization with an artifact also called the Twilight Hammer. The whole thing felt.. recursive? Why are there two arcane initiates? Are they one and the same? If so, then why is this arcane initiate referring to itself in third person?|Quest: Hunt down the Gorm Matriarch ..|Title:  that love makes us vulnerable .|Dialogue:  I ' ll cut you in on the profits , of course , compensate you quite well .

1|1|1|Ok..

Prompt 1 definitely was the most responsive. It was a clear and concise answer to "what troubles you" with a call to action that made sense.

Prompt 2 was convoluted... if there's like three different A.I.s writing this, then I think I can recognize this one pretty easily. It wants me to collect 500 gems, so that I can... make gems... It's just not cohesive. Usually, people don't promote you when you first meet them.

Prompt 3 has English problems. The quest title turned into a dialogue instead. The dialogue itself had a decent hook, but the objectives weren't clear due to bad grammar/english.

Prompt 1 was the most engaging because it created a conflict in a few sentences, and a clear goal to help in this conflict. I know WHY I'm helping, even if I don't understand the whole situation completely.

Prompt 2 had the most creative ideas, but they fell flat. It feels like the language of prompt 2 is good, just the whole vision, thought, scenario? The story building? Is fundamentally broken. Hardly anything links together, it just feels like common adventure terms smashed together, trying to force impossible connections.

Prompt 3 Had a vision, but failed on delivery. If it was reworded, this could have been a great quest. It feels like there is a concept here, the a.i. just struggles to communicate it.|Quest: Slay 6 Ashvane combatants in Unity Square . |Title: Enemies Within|Dialogue: We need to get Katherine to safety .

2|1|1|Prompt 1 was the only quest that made sense. Even if the NPC didn't respond directly to my question, it made sense enough that I would just find it quirky of them.

Prompt 2 and 3 are complete and utter trash. I don't want to walk into a dinosaur, and I don't want to speak with Elixer, bring back Elixer, and create Elixer.

Yeah prompt 1 was funny. I love the idea of a mud hunter just needing mud and calling the player George for no reason. Hopefully this mud hunter keeps calling me George.|Quest: Obtain 9 piles of Obsidian-Flecked Mud . |Title: Mud Hunter|Dialogue: Hope you're not afraid of getting dirty .

3|1|2|Prompt 1 was good because it actually dealt with dragons. However, it falls flat as the prompt fails to use words correctly. The idea just isn't cohesive. Why would I need to make stuff out of gems in order to learn how to use the gems? Seems like a logical error, I should learn how to use the gems first. 

They remembered my name! I am now George haha. The only issue I have with prompt 2 is that it appears reaaally railroady. It almost feels like no matter what I say, there's a defined quest that it's going to take me to regardless.
