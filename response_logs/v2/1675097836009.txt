1|2|2|2 was the most like someone needing help, making it fit the input better.

2|1|3|Prompt 1 was only slightly relevant, involving armor, but the language was incoherent and hard enough to follow that it wasn't interesting. Prompt 3 sounded more interesting and was much more coherent, giving a clear purpose and prospects of something exciting. |Quest: Go see Chainmail Armor and bring back 1 Chainmail Armor|Title: Chainmail Armor|Dialogue: This is much armor ! Now I don't see why you wouldn't give it to me . Let me show you the armor on the armor we have here . You will find it in piles along the sides of the canyon with the lava flowing into it .

3|1|2|Prompt 1 and 2 were both relevant, number 1 more like an actual response. However, number 2 felt more interesting because it had more information and the language carried more sense of urgency, so I would be more likely to do that quest. |Quest: Go see Family and bring back 1 Family|Title: More Family Friends|Dialogue: If you were here a minute ago , you would know my brother and sister are in trouble .
