0|2|1|Q2 felt responsive because there seemed a possibility that gathering the melons could lead to finding a unicorn. Q1 seemed the most involved and fun out of the three quests. |Quest: Kill Mary to obtain 500 Gems|Title: Gemless|Dialogue: Well now you're up to some serious coin collecting , you should find yourself quite bored . What better way to fill your coffers than to help out the local economy ? The Gems scattered throughout Shattrath and Draenor are all being sold to the highest grade buyers throughout the city . It's just a matter of time before someone goes and buys up as much as they can . |Quest: You must gather 8 Melonfruit and squeeze their juices into the Cup of Elune at Sargeron . |Title: Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix|Dialogue: The markings on the Sargeron ruins , combined with what you've gleaned from Furien's text make one thing clear:There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune . It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain . First , of course , there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash . Pondering this problem , you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree . . . . |Quest: Explore the Chamber of Heart ..|Title:  I believe he had some of his sanity , though not all of our explosives , and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins of our vault at the eastern edge of the grove .|Dialogue:  The highest grade of the mineral comes not from experience or development , but from the giants around the Netherstone .|gp2/wow/ngram
1|2|1|Q2 talked about bounty in the title, which connected most closely to pirates. Q1 seemed like a really interesting quest, although I was a little confused about the goal of it. |Quest: Gather Magic to create Magic|Title: Tinker , Mechanic|Dialogue: As you do so , mind's eye glows red with brilliant energy . You feel a surge of magic coursing through it . Perhaps later you should combine the energy to summon a powerful proto-beast . Surely our ancient cousins would be pleased . |Quest: |Title: Quartermaster's Bounty|Dialogue:  |Quest: Craft the Sapphronetta Flivvers Action Figure at Pascal - K1N6 ' s database ..|Title:  She sacrificed herself to serve the Old Gods .|Dialogue:  Kill him , and the Stormwind Army will reward you handsomely . Beware . But your contributions cannot be divided . This Old Lighthouse The old lighthouse out to the clearing , east of here . The Temple .|gp2/wow/ngram
2|3|3|While it didnâ€™t directly address helping the NPC personally, Q3 talked about helping someone. It also seemed like the most interesting quest to try. |Quest: Get me Mayor to create Mayor|Title: A New Mayor|Dialogue: What do you think ? Sounds impressive and creative ! |Quest: Help Deceptia This Is Not a Quest We need help ! But not from you ..|Title:  Seek any clue that might lead directly to Dargrul .|Dialogue:  Njormeld in Dun Niffelem . Use Vishax ' s Portal .

I wish Joseph could again be with his daughter , but it cannot be so . His soul was twisted by the Scourge , and he became a monster . Pamela's fate is sealed , but perhaps we can change Joseph's fate . A strange gnome arrived here at this tower not long ago . Her name is Chromie . Take that sword to her . I have a feeling she will be able to help us . |gp2/ngram/wow
3|2|3|Q2 seemed the closest to asking about a sword, since it mentioned a blade. Q3, however, seemed like the most developed of the quests and the most interesting. |Quest: Kill Sword to obtain 8 Wood|Title: Disease Prevention|Dialogue: A demon named Sargeras has infested the forest's root system and is breeding wood to control the forest . We cannot allow Sargeras to succeed . Take this to the root of the corruption and spread the word to the others here . Be prepared if an attack occurs . We must not allow them to succeed . You will fight your way to the root or the forest will suffer ! |Quest: Build A Bigger Fish Trap With those minnows and some spare parts for our own golems , so here ' s the case ..|Title:  Do not disappoint me !
