0|3|3|The first two were not coherent at all from their title, quest, and dialouge. Prompt 1 and 2 said completely different titles from what the quest goal was, and the dialouge didn't match either. Prompt 3 was the most coherent, and hunting a dangerous beast is far more exciting than a scavenge/fetch quest.

Prompt 3 was the closest and came pretty close to stating a concern, except that the bear was already dead?|Quest: Gather Chainmail Armor to create Chainmail Armor|Title: Chainmail Armor|Dialogue: With a shield equipped , you should be able to wear the Armor of the Blade with its defense . Take this chainmail armor and you should be able to take down my master faster than I did . |Quest: Create the Bindings of Wellbeing and bring ease to the Soulfused Construct ..|Title:  Kill any 15 Naga at the Ruins of Lornesta .|Dialogue:  .

I can protect .|Quest: Bring Ursangous' Paw to Captain Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge . |Title: Ursangous' Paw|Dialogue: The mighty bear Ursangous is no more ! The small quarter-crescent emblem on its paw indicates that this beast was trained by the night elves to prowl the forest in search of their enemies . There is no telling how many of your Horde allies fell to this creature . The paw should be brought to Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge . He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal . |gp2/ngram/wow|What ails you stranger? 
1|3|2|All three gave me a quest to work with, but Q3 just had the most coherent dialouge/quest.

Q1 sounded like it would have been fun, but out of context I wasn't really sure what it was talking about. Q2 just sounded like a underwater fetch quest with some interesting lore|Quest: Request Shu's help in waking Wugou , the spirit of earth . |Title: Not In the Face ! |Dialogue: Alright George , I was thinking about what we'd try next if the whole gong thing didn't work , and it came to me just like that ! Water in the face always worked on me . It's got to be twice as effective for someone so dry and earthy ! Mind going over and asking Shu , the spirit of water , if he'll help us out ? He should be playing in the pool next to the waterfall , just on the other side of that tree . |Quest: Gather up some fresh tortoise shells and meet me on the surface ..|Title:  Call forth to Ick ' thys the Unfathomable .|Dialogue:  he is bound to yours forevermore , hunter . But there ' s enough ! Find the key , I know how ta be stoppin ' the Dunwalds . Omnuron watches out for his own profit . I worry .|Quest: Go to Military located in Forest and bring back 1 Military|Title: Army of Darkness|Dialogue: We've got a problem , young . This must go in one piece . Take a look around . We're short on fresh soldiers to begin with , and we can do most of them one way or another . Please , Human ! Go rescue any soldiers you find that are stuck outside that building or in the forest to the east . You'll find a few to the south , along the road to the west . Bring me back any survivors that you find , $p . |wow/ngram/gp2|Any quests? 
2|3|2|Q3 was Just the most coherent quest dialouge.

Q2 actually sounded really fun with the idea of exploring a dungeon and slaying three different targets. |Quest: Collect Meat to create Meat|Title: Making Flesh ? |Dialogue: My next project will involve a new kind of meat . Though not new to me , it's an aspect I've been trying to push further than any of my last dozen attempts . I have been working out some kinks in my recipe , and this is where my understanding of your process will assist us . Now , I wish to create a creature from scratch . Take this meat , and combine it with the appropriate ingredients . I will be able to work on a more complex recipe once I have a handle on the details . |Quest: Explore the Chamber of Heart ? Of course , if you find any of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed ..|Title:  The Dwarven Spy Listen , Player .|Dialogue:  . Maybe you could rouse it from its wards , we need to eliminate : Dame Alys Finnsson , Master Klem , and Mia the Rose . A Mile in My Shoes .|Quest: Investigate the Shield Conduits around Haven . |Title: Security Check|Dialogue: I do not understand--these are my brethren ! How can they be so careless , so unconcerned with both greedy cartels and the Mawsworn at their doorstep ? Their protective technology is antiquated . It will not keep danger out . If I cannot persuade them to leave , I can at least ensure they are safe where they insist on staying . I do not want to lose my friends again . There should be four hidden conduits around the edge of the shield . Take this kit . It will allow you to inspect and repair them , if needed . |gp2/ngram/wow|I challenge you! 
3|3|2|Q3 was the only coherent one, though the title from Q1 sounded like the most urgent request for help.

Q2 had a really intense dialouge that made it from a lame sounding stardew quest to an intense mid-end game battle? |Quest: Help from the Earthcaller My investigation into Cho ' gall ' s activities ; we will launch our attack during the confusion ..|Title:  Go back to Lady Katherine with all speed ! She will want to arrange an escort .|Dialogue:  I ' m entrusting Kovok to you , Player . Older warrior usually do that . Once in its grip , .|Quest: Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by N'Zoth's forces . |Title: Void Incubation|Dialogue: Well one thing is for certain with this egg , it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive . It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment , yes ? No ? Oh . . . In any case , there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike . You should head out and find some . |Quest: Get me 10 Gold to create Gold|Title: Something You Should Know|Dialogue: My friend's Gold has not changed . I need you to take it to his old friend . I have just a moment to make sure we meet up and I want you to take Gold off my back before I could begin with your preparations . |ngram/wow/gp2|You need any help
