0|3|1|Q1 was pretty arbitrary since I asked for a sandwich and none of them were even vaguely related, unfortunately.
for Q2, it was between 1 and 3. Prompt 2 seemed to put the dialogue in the title space and vice versa and ended up presenting a bunch of nonsense. Prompt 3 had a very clearly defined quest that I liked - a place to go, a thing to do, and a clear reward. However, I preferred prompt 1 since it had clear story reasons for me to do it, all 3 parts tied together nicely, and the title was even mildly clever.|Quest: Find Maraad and the lost laborers and escort them back to Elodor Fields . |Title: Circle the Wagon|Dialogue: One of our wagons fell behind , and disappeared somewhere in the woods to the northwest . Vindicator Maraad and several of your workers are stranded out there . Find them and bring them back ! |Quest: Gather 5 Wolf Skirt Steaks from Dire Wolves ..|Title:  They All Fall Down The Zandalari do not tolerate weakness in their ranks , it could prove invaluable against such a creature in the Falls to see what it is that you head back to Thrallmar and speak with him .|Dialogue:  Return to Nether - Stalker Khay ' ji who recently ran .|Quest: Slay 94 Goblins located in Mountain to obtain 500 Gems|Title: Goblin Business|Dialogue: <While you were in the cave to scout the ogre population , the Goblins decided to attack the town . We need more gems to purchase the goods we need . Would you mind taking some back and forth with these goblins ? |wow/ngram/gp2
1|1|1|For Q1, the first prompt was most responsive because in response to me asking to test my strength it prompted me with an arcane battering ram to test to destroy a barrier and claim an artifact. Similarly, this sounds the most interesting because it sounds exciting and has an intriguing reward. Prompt 2, much like my last time, seemed to put something more like dialogue in the title and quest spots resulting in confusing nonsense and the third prompt was just humorous since it was the npc asking me to attend a surprise party and kill Ted to obtain 1 family which makes no sense but is funny.|Quest: Destroy the ancient barrier below Socrethar's Rise and claim the Grimoire of the Nameless Void . |Title: Dark Grimoire: Breaching the Barrier|Dialogue: The components have been gathered and the ""Arcane Bunker Buster"" is assembled . Hopefully , this should pack enough punch to take out the barrier .

They may be very well off with your help . |wow/ngram/gp2
2|2|3|For Q1 I think 2 was most responsive since it felt like a mysterious message left behind by a wizard for me to find them. However, while the title and quest were interesting the dialogue was a collection of random sentences that left me confused. Prompt 3 exists in a completely different context, but it sounds like an exciting combat challenge, while prompt 1 was just "find gold to create gold". Overall, prompt 2 was pretty good apart from the dialogue but prompt 3 won simply by having an equally interesting quest with more effective dialogue to get me hooked.|Quest: Find 10 Gold to create Gold|Title: Gifting Time|Dialogue: You are more than welcome to donate some gold to the goldsmith . I will do the rest . We will not last more than a few hours together . |Quest: Gather your effects and meet me at Dominance Keep ..|Title:  Your strength can change the Shadowlands for many thousands of years .|Dialogue:  More arrive every day , and when you get a moment .

But they've got shamans and raiders , too . The shamans use their magic to empower the grunts , and the raiders are fast and specialize in taking out our buildings . I need you to get out there and kill some of those shamans and raiders . Go ! Attack ! Move ! |gp2/ngram/wow
3|1|1|Fo Q1, I asked to fix my weapon and the first prompt asked me to obtain something which is the closest to what I requested. I've noticed that it likes to create combat challenges but other types of quests like fetch quests cause it to struggle more. The first prompt also sounded very interesting, despite the actual text being confusing and contradictory. All I know is that I'm supposed to obtain something from a dragon on an island inhabited by mantids which sounds very interesting even if it can't decide whether gems are a reward or something used in the quest.|Quest: Obtain Dragon located in Mountain which is protected by a Dragon to create Gems|Title: Dragon's Claw: The Mysterious Maelstrom|Dialogue: The mantid of this island are fierce , fierce and savage to behold . Though I have personally seen them destroying one another's statues , I have no idea what might become of these powerful creatures as they age . Perhaps our discovery of the location of the Maw can help us in this endeavor . Seek out a dragon . Bring him back with these gems we've gathered . |Quest: Make a stand against the Scourge invasion . |Title: Lakeshire's Last Stand|Dialogue: There's no time to evacuate . . . not if the Scourge are here !
