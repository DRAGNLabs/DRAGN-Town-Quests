1|1|1|Prompt 1 was the only one that mentioned dragons. I entered "I want to befriend a dragon", so that felt like a problem. It didn't really mention befriending dragons, but stealing gems from them instead. That was a little off. Points for being the most coherent and interesting prompt, though.|Quest: Go to Dragon located in Mountain and bring back Gems possesed by Dragon|Title: Collect Your Own ! |Dialogue: Gems are for the gryphons !

2|2|3|I picked Prompt 1 for "most responsive" because it's possible I came to see the queen to give her cake (???) or apply for a position as a castle baker or something, but still. Didn't make sense. Prompt 1 was incoherent. Prompt 3 was interesting but had nothing to do with the statement I entered ("I am here to see the queen.")|Quest: Build - A - N ?

3|2|3|I asked for a horse ("I need a horse!") and none of the prompts mentioned horses or steeds or anything like that. It would have made sense if the NPC said "since you have nothing to trade for a horse, go get this for me and I will make a trade with you" or "the steeds in my stable are all spoken for, go to _____  - IF YOU DARE!" or they could have said "No one leaves this place because of the _____; get rid of it and I will outfit you for your journey most handsomely!" or something like that. It doesn't feel like the resulting prompts have anything to do with what I say.|Quest: Search tables for the Skewering Needles , Razorthread Spools and Clotting Patches ..|Title:  Could you get some advice on crane hunting : The greatest cranes of the Krasarang Wilds .|Dialogue:  Vengeance Will Be Ours We aren ' t exactly strong in the subtlety department , if you ' re smarter than this !
