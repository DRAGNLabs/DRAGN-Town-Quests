0|2|2|Q2 was the most coherent of the answers, which made it easier to understand what I was supposed to do.

1|1|1|Q1 definitely had the most interesting elements for the quest, and even though the mission statement was longer it still felt coherent.

Destroy 6 Talrendis Glaive Throwers and bomb the Command Center . |Title: Blacken the Skies|Dialogue: George ! Give us a hand here , will ya ?

Would you be willing to help me ? |wow/ngram/gp2|How can I complete this task?
2|1|1|I felt like Q1 had the most expressive words and action statements, as well as the most colorful language. It was coherent enough to understand the objective while still giving the NPC some character. |Quest: Kill Captain Dreadbeard . |Title: Captain Dreadbeard|Dialogue: Alright , babe , I've got something bigger for you to take on here . We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south; that's to the south , and NOT the one we've been suicidally bum-rushing for the better part of several hours .

3|2|2|Q2 was definitely the most coherent of the questions, which raises its stock significantly. The words "urgency" and "return immediately" definitely convey a sense of excitement. |Quest: Go to Dwarves and bring back 1 Pickaxe|Title: Gaining a Better Understanding|Dialogue: This axe is the prototype for an object we'll use to destroy the Scourge . It's a perfect fit for whatever purpose will be used on our new weapon . I believe it also bears a striking resemblance to its wielder--assuming he's allowed to wear it , of course .
